a clerical collar round his throat and a dark norfolk jacket on his back is playing the flute before a very large framed photograph of a woman which is the only picture on the walls his age is about thirtyfive his figure thin and very upright and his cleanshorn face thin upright narrow with long and rather pointed ears his dark hair is brushed in a coxcomb off his forehead a faint smile hovers about his lips that nature has made rather full and he has made thin as though keeping a hard secret but his bright grey eyes dark round the rim look out and upwards almost as if he were being crucified there is something about the whole of him that makes him seen not quite present a gentle creature burnt within a low broad window above a windowseat forms the background to his figure and through its lattice panes are seen the outer gate and yewtrees of a churchyard and the porch of a church bathed in may sunlight the front door at right angles to the windowseat leads to the village green and a door on the left into the house it is the third movement of veracinis violin sonata that strangway plays his back is turned to the door into the house and he does not hear when it is opened and ivy burlacombe the farmers daughter a girl of fourteen small and quiet as a mouse comes in a prayerbook in one hand and in the other a gloss of water with wild orchis and a bit of deep pink hawthorn she sits down on the windowseat and having opened her book sniffs at the flowers coming to the end of the movement strangway stops and looking up at the face on the wall heaves a long sigh ivy from the seat i picked these for yu mr strangway strangway turning with a start ah ivy thank you he puts his flute down on a chair against the far wall where are the others as he speaks gladys freman a dark gipsyish girl and connie trustaford a fair stolid blueeyed saxon both about sixteen come in through the front door behind which they have evidently been listening they too have prayerbooks in their hands they sidle past ivy and also sit down under the window gladys mercys comin mr strangway strangway good morning gladys good morning connie he turns to a bookcase on a table against the far wall and taking out a book finds his place in it while he stands thus with his back to the girls mercy jarland comes in from the green she also is about sixteen with fair hair and chinablue eyes she glides in quickly hiding something behind her and sits down on the seat next the door and at once there is a whispering strangway turning to them good morning mercy mercy good morning mr strangway strangway now yesterday i was telling you what our lords coming meant to the world i want you to understand that before he came there wasnt really love as we know it i dont mean to say that there werent many good people but there wasnt love for the sake of loving dyou think you understand what i mean mercy fidgets gladyss eyes are following a fly ivy yes mr strangway

sucking her sweet her sister mercy comes in furtively still frowning and vindictive mercy what havent you found it tibby get along with ee then she accelerates the stolid tissys departure with a smack searches under the seat finds and picks up the deserted sixpence then very quickly she goes to the door but it is opened before she reaches it and finding herself caught she slips behind the chintz windowcurtain a woman has entered who is clearly the original of the large photograph she is not strictly pretty but there is charm in her pale resolute face with its mocking lips flexible brows and greenish eyes whose lids square above them have short dark lashes she is dressed in blue and her fair hair is coiled up under a cap and motorveil she comes in swiftly and closes the door behind her becomes irresolute then suddenly deciding moves towards the door into the house mercy slips from behind her curtain to make off but at that moment the door into the house is opened and she has at once to slip back again into covert it is ivy who has appeared ivy amazed oh mrs strangway evidently disconcerted by this appearance beatrice strangway pulls herself together and confronts the child with a smile beatrice well ivy youve grown you didnt expect me did you ivy no mrs strangway but i hoped yud be comin soon beatrice ah yes is mr strangway in ivy hypnotized by those faintly smiling lips yes

stopping at the door mothers pluckin a duck only please mrs strangway if she comes in even after vuve gone shell know because because yu always have that particular nice scent beatrice thank you my child ill see to that ivy looks at her as if she would speak again then turns suddenly and goes out beatrices face darkens she shivers taking out a little cigarette case she lights a cigarette and

then turning to the door says in a low voice go go please quickly do what you will i wont hurt you cantbut go he opens the door beatrice greatly moved thank you she passes him with her head down and goes out quickly strangway stands unconsciously tearing at the little birdcage and while he tears at it he utters a moaning sound the terrified mercy peering from behind the curtain and watching her chance slips to the still open door but in her haste and fright she knocks against it and strangway sees her before he can stop her she has fled out on to the green and away while he stands there paralysed the door from the house is opened and mrs burlacombe approaches him in a queer hushed way mrs burlacombe her eyes mechanically fixed on the twisted birdcage in his hands tis poor sue cremer

door figures are lurking or moving stealthily people waiting and listening to the sound of a voice speaking in the church words that are inaudible excited whispering and faint giggles come from the deepest yew tree shade made ghostly by the white faces and the frocks of young girls continually flitting up and back in the blackness a girls figure comes flying out from the porch down the path of light and joins the stealthy group whispering voice of mercy wheres e got to now gladys whispering voice of gladys eve just finished voice of connie whu pushed tdoor open voice of gladys tim clyst i

six voices comes out to them rather sweet and clear gladys softly tis pretty tu why theyre only singin one verse a moments silence and the voice speaks uplifted pronouncing the blessing the peace of god as the last words die away dark figures from the inn approach over the grass till quite a crowd seems standing there without a word spoken then from out of the church porch come the congregation tim clyst first hastily lost among the waiting figures in the dark old mrs potter a half blind old lady groping her way and perceiving nothing out of the ordinary the two maids from the hall self conscious and scared scuttling along last ivy burlacombe quickly and starting back at the dim halfhidden crowd voice of gladys whispering ivy here quick ivy sways darts off towards the voice and is

whisperings luke zee there hes comin and then a perfectly dead silence the figure of strangway is seen in his dark clothes passing from the vestry to the church porch he stands plainly visible in the lighted porch locking the door then steps forward just as he reaches the edge of the porch a low hiss breaks the silence it swells very gradually into a long hissing groan strangway stands motionless his hand over his eyes staring into the darkness a girls figure can be seen to break out of the darkness and rush away when at last the groaning has died into sheer expectancy strangway drops his hand strangway in a loco voice yes im glad is jarland there freman hes ereno thanks to yu hsss the hiss breaks out again then dies away jarlands voice threatening try if yu can du it again strangway no

lifts the bales of straw to a long ladder leaning against a rafter this gives all the light there is save for a slender track of moonlight slanting in from the end where the two great doors are not

feet gladys ivy connie and mercy tim clyst and bobbie jarland a boy of fifteen are dancing a truncated figure of eight and their shadow are dancing alongside on the walls shoes and some apples have been thrown down close to the side door through which they have come in now and then ivy the smallest and best of the dancers ejaculates words of direction and one of the youths grunts or breathes

moments on the tambourine tibby is overcome once more by sleep and falls back again into her nest of hay with her little shoed feet just visible over the edge of the bench ivy catches up the tambourine and to her beating and humming the dancers dance on suddenly gladys stops like a wild animal surprised and cranes her neck towards the aide door connie whispering what is it gladys whispering i hear some one comin across the yard she leads a noiseless scamper towards the shoes bobbie jarland shins up the ladder and seizes the lantern ivy drops the tambourine they all fly to the big doors and vanish into the moonlight pulling the door nearly to again after them there is the sound of scrabbling at the hitch of the side door and strangway comes into the nearly dark barn out in the night the owl is still hooting he closes the door and that sound is lost like a man walking in his sleep he goes up to the ladder takes the rope in his hand and makes a noose he can be heard breathing and in the darkness the motions of his hands are dimly seen freeing his throat and putting the noose round his neck he stands swaying to and fro at the foot of the ladder then with a sigh sets his foot on it to mount one of the big doors creaks and opens in the wind letting in a broad path of moonlight strangway stops freeing his neck from the noose he walks quickly up the track of moonlight whitened from head to foot to close the doors the sound of his boots on the bare floor has awakened tibby jarland struggling out of her hay nest she stands staring at his whitened figure and bursts suddenly into a wail tibby ooh mercy where are yu im frightened im frightened ooooo strangway turning startled whos that who is it tibby ooh a ghosty ooooo strangway going to her quickly its me

takes up the wine and goes press above his head i say let me down this is a bit undignified you know my papers a great organ poulder after a moments hesitation well take im down james hell do some mischief among the bottles james op off your base and trust to me the press slides off the bins edge is received by james and not landed gently poulder contemplating him the incidents closed no illfeeling i hope press noo poulder thats right clearing his throat while were waitin for lord william if youre interested in wine philosophically you can read the history of the times in this cellar

drink it we shall be havin the next great war with luck that ock may lie there another quarter of a century and a sweet pretty wine itll be i only hope i may be here to drink it ah he shakes his head but look at claret times are hard on claret were givin it an awful doin now theres a ponty canny he points to a bin if we werent so opelessly allied with france that wine would have a reasonable future as it is none we drink it up and up not more than sixty dozen left and wheres its equal to come from for a dinner wine ah i ask you on the other hand port is steady made in a little country all

ask what do they pay you if its not indelicate the press shrugs his shoulders can you do it at the money the press shakes his head still its an easy life ive regretted sometimes that i didnt have a shot at it myself influencin other people without disclosin your identity something very attractive about that lowering his voice between man and man nowwhat do you think of the situation of the country these processions of the unemployed the red flag an the marsillaisy in the streets all this talk about an upheaval press well speaking as a socialist poulder astounded why i thought your paper was tory press so it is thats nothing poulder openmouthed dear me pointing to the bomb do you really think theres something in this james sepulchrally igh explosive press taking out his notebook too much anyway to let it drop a pleasant voice calls poulder hallo poulder forming a trumpet with his hand me lord as lord william appears james overcome by reminiscences salutes and is mechanically answered lord william has charm his hair and moustache are crisp and just beginning to grizzle his bearing is free easy and only faintly armoured he will go far to meet you any day he is in full

the way what do you value your house and collection at lord w twisting his little mustache really i cant really press might i say a quarter of a millionlifted in two seconds and a halfhundred thousand to the second it brings it home you know lord w no no dash it no press disappointed i see not draw attention to your property in the present excited state of public feeling well suppose we approach it from the viewpoint of the antisweating dinner i have the list of guests very weighty lord w taken some liftingwouldnt they press seriously may i say that you designed the dinner to soften the tension at this crisis you saw that case i suppose this morning of the woman dying of starvation in bethnal green lord w desperately yesyes ive been horribly affected i always knew this slump would come after

waistcoat with pearl buttons at a sign of resentment from his victim i want the human touch lord william its everything in my paper what do you say about this attempt to bomb you lord w well in a way i think its d d natural press scribbling lord william thought it d d natural lord w overhearing no no dont put that down what i mean is i should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the marseillaise about the streets fellows that have been in the war real sports they are you know thorough good chaps at bottom and say to them have a feeling heart boys put yourself in my position i dont believe a bit theyd want to bomb me then he walks up and down press scribbling and muttering the idea of brotherhood dyou mind my saying that word brotherhood always effective always he writes lord e bewildered brotherhood well its pure accident that im here and theyre there all the same i cant pretend to be starving cant go out into hyde park and stand on a tub can i but if i could only show them what i feel theyre such good chaps poor devils press i quite appreciate he writes camel and needles eye you were at eton and oxford your constituency i know clubs but i can get all that is it your view that christianity is on the up grade lord william lord w dubious what dyou mean by christianity loving kindness and that of course i think that dogmas got the knock he walks press writing lord william thought dogma had got the knock i should like you just to develop your definition of christianity loving kindness strikes rather a new note lord w new what about the sermon on the mount press writing refers to sermon on mount i take it you dont belong to any church lord william lord w exasperated well really ive been baptised and that sort of thing but look here press oh you can trust me i shant say anything that youll regret now do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet the country lord w well i think it would be a deuced good thing if everybody were a bit more kind press ah musing i feel that your views are strikingly original lord william if you could just open out on them a little more how far would you apply kindness in practice lord w can you apply it in theory press i believe it is done but would you allow yourself to be blown up with impunity lord w well thats a bit extreme but i quite sympathise with this chap imagine yourself in his shoes he sees a huge house all these bottles us swilling them down perhaps hes got a starving wife or consumptive kids press writing and murmuring umm kids lord w he thinks but for the grace of god there swill i why should that blighter have everything and i nothing and all that press writing and all that eagerly yes lord w and gradually you see this contrast becomes an obsession with him theres got to be an example made he thinks and er he makes it dont you know press writing yees and when youre the example lord w well you feel a bit blue of course but my point is that you quite see it press from the other world do you believe in a future life lord william the public took a lot of interest in the question if you remember at the time of the war it might revive at any moment if theres to be a revolution lord w the wish is always father to the thought isnt it press yes but er doesnt the question of a future life rather bear on your point about kindness if there isnt one why be kind lord w well i should say one oughtnt to be kind for any motive thats selfinterest but just because one feels it dont you know press writing vigorously thats very new very new lord w simply you chaps are wonderful press doubtfully you mean were were lord w no really you have such a d d hard time it must be perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me press oh not at all lord william not at all i

foot is encased accord he is a thin driedup man of about fiftyfive with a rather refined rather kindly and rather cranky countenance close to him stands his very upstanding nineteenyearold daughter jill with clubbed hair round a pretty manly face jill you know dodo its all pretty good rot in these days hillcrist cads are cads jill even in these days jill what is a cad hillcrist a selfassertive fellow without a sense of other people jill well old hornblower ill give you hillcrist i wouldnt take him jill well youve got him now charlie chearlie i say the importance of not being charlie hillcrist good heavens do you know their christian names jill my dear father theyve been here seven years hillcrist in old days we only knew their christian names from their tombstones jill charlie hornblower isnt really half a bad sport hillcrist about a quarter of a bad sport ive always thought out hunting jill pulling his hair now his wife chloe hillcrist whimsical gad your motherd have a fit if she knew you called her chloe jill its a ripping name hillcrist chloe hm i had a spaniel once jill dodo youre narrow buck up old darling it wont do chloe has seen life im pretty sure thats attractive anyway no mothers not in the room dont turn your uneasy eyes hillcrist really my dear you are getting jill the limit now rolf hillcrist whats rolf another dog jill rolf hornblowers a topper he really is a nice boy hillcrist with a sharp look oh hes a nice boy jill yes darling you know what a nice boy is dont you hillcrist not in these days jill well ill tell you in the first place hes not amorous hillcrist what well thats some comfort jill just a jolly good companion hillcrist to whom jill well to anyone me hillcrist where jill anywhere you dont suppose i confine myself to the home paddocks do you im naturally rangey father hillcrist ironically you dont say so jill in the second place he doesnt like discipline hillcrist jupiter he does seem attractive jill in the third place he bars his father hillcrist is that essential to nice girls too jill with a twirl of his hair fish not fourthly hes got ideas hillcrist i knew it jill for instance he thinks as i do hillcrist ah good ideas jill pulling gently careful he thinks old people run the show too much he says they oughtnt to because theyre so damtouchy are you damtouchy darling hillcrist well im i dont know about touchy jill he says therell be no world fit to live in till we get rid of the old we must make them climb a tall tree and shake them off it hillcrist drily oh he says that jill otherwise with the way they stand on each others rights theyll spoil the garden for the young hillcrist does his father agree jill oh rolf doesnt talk to him his mouths too large have you ever seen it dodo hillcrist of course jill its considerable isnt it now yours is reticent darling rumpling his hair hillcrist it wont be in a minute do you realise that ive got gout jill poor ducky how long have we been here dodo hillcrist since elizabeth anyway jill looking at his foot it has its drawbacks dyou think hornblower had a father i believe he was spontaneous but dodo why all this this attitude to the hornblowers she purses her lips and makes a gesture as of pushing persons away hillcrist because theyre pushing jill thats only because we are as mother would say and theyre not yet but why not let them be hillcrist you cant jill why hillcrist it takes generations to learn to live and let live jill people like that take an ell when you give them an inch jill but if you gave them the ell they wouldnt want the inch why should it all be such a skin game hillcrist skin game where do you get your lingo jill keep to the point dodo hillcrist well jill all lifes a struggle between people at different stages of development in different positions with different amounts of social influence and property and the only thing is to have rules of the game and keep them new people like the hornblowers havent learnt those rules their only rule is to get all they can jill darling dont prose theyre not half as bad as you think hillcrist well when i sold hornblower longmeadow and the cottages i certainly found him all right all the same hes got the cloven hoof warming up his influence in deepwater is thoroughly bad those potteries of his are demoralising the whole atmosphere of the place is changing it was a thousand pities he ever came here and discovered that clay hes brought in the modern cutthroat spirit jill cut our throat spirit you mean whats your definition of a gentleman dodo hillcrist uneasily cant describe only feel it jill oh try hillcrist well er i suppose you might say a man who keeps his form and doesnt let life scupper him out of his standards jill but suppose his standards are low hillcrist with some earnestness i assume of course that hes honest and tolerant gentle to the weak and not selfseeking jill ah selfseeking but arent we all dodo i am hillcrist with a smile you jill scornfully oh yes too young to know hillcrist nobody knows till theyre under pretty heavy fire jill jill except of course mother hillcrist how do you mean mother jill mother reminds me of england according to herself always right whatever she does hillcrist yees your mother it perhaps the perfect woman jill thats what i was saying now no one could call you perfect dodo besides youve got gout hillcrist yes and i want fellows ring that bell jill crossing to the bell shall i tell you my definition of a gentleman a man who gives the hornblower his due she rings the bell and i think mother ought to call on them rolf says old hornblower resents it fearfully that shes never made a sign to chloe the three years shes been here hillcrist i dont interfere with your mother in such matters she may go and call on the devil himself if she likes jill i know youre ever so much better than she is hillcrist thats respectful jill you do keep your prejudices out of your phiz but mother literally looks down her nose and she never forgives an h theyd get the hell from her if they took the hinch hillcrist jillyour language jill dont slime out of it dodo i say mother ought to call on the hornblowers no answer well hillcrist my dear i always let people have the last word it makes them feel funny ugh my footenter fellows left fellows send into the village and get another bottle of

straws about that jack hillcrist he must when its put to him if hes got any decent feeling mrs h he hasnt hillcrist suddenly the jackmans talk of his having bought the centry to put up more chimneys mrs h never at the window looking out impossible it would ruin the place utterly besides cutting us off from the dukes oh no miss mullins would never sell behind our backs hillcrist anyway i must stop his turning these people out mrs h with a little smile almost contemptuous you might have known hed do something of the sort you will imagine people are like yourself jack you always ought to make dawker have things in black and white hillcrist i said quite distinctly of course you wont want to disturb the tenancies theres a great shortage of cottages hornblower told me as distinctly that he wouldnt what more do you want mrs h a man like that thinks of nothing but the short cut to his own way looking out of the window towards the rise if he buys the centry and puts up chimneys we simply couldnt stop here hillcrist my father would turn in his grave mrs h it would have been more useful if hed not dipped the estate and sold the centry this hornblower hates us he thinks we turn up our noses at him hillcrist as we do amy mrs h who wouldnt a man without traditions who believes in nothing but money and push hillcrist suppose he wont budge can we do anything for the jackmans mrs h

and uneasy rolfs getting me some water jill why do you stay you didnt want to come did you chloe shakes her head all right heres your water she hands back the particulars and slides over to her seat passing rolf in the gangway with her chin well up mrs hillcrist who has watched chloe and jill and dawker and his friend makes an enquiring movement with her hand but gets a disappointing answer jill whats the time dodo hillcrist looking at his watch three minutes past jill sighing oh hell hillcrist jill jill sorry dodo i was only thinking look here he is phew isnt he mrs h sh the auctioneer comes in left and goes to the table he is a square short brownfaced common looking man with clipped grey hair fitting him like a cap and a clipped grey moustache his lids come down over his quick eyes till he can see you very sharply and you can hardly see that he can see you he can break into a smile at any moment which has no connection with him as it were by a certain hurt look however when bidding is slow he discloses that he is not merely an auctioneer but has in him elements of the human being he can wink with anyone and is dressed in a snugbrown suit with a perfectly unbuttoned waistcoat a low turned down collar and small black and white sailor knot tie while he is settling his papers the hillcrists settle themselves tensely chloe has drunk her water and leaned back again with the smelling salts to her nose rolf leans forward in the seat beside her looking sideways at jill a solicitor with a grey beard has joined the auctioneer at his table auctioneer tapping the table sorry to

to his wife and touches her charles chloe arent you well in the start which she gives her face is fully revealed to the audience charles come along out of the way of these people he jerks his head

and crow jill yes dodo yes mother hold him while i suddenly she stops and all the fun goes out of her no i cant i cant help thinking of her curtain falls for a minute scene ii when it rises again the room is empty and dark same for moonlight coming in through the french window which is open the figure of chloe in a black cloak appears outside in the moonlight she peers in moves past comes bank hesitatingly enters the cloak fallen back reveals a white evening dress and that magpie figure stands poised watchfully in the dim light then flaps unhappily left and right as if she could not keep still suddenly she stands listening rolfs voice outside chloe chloe he appears chloe going to the window what are you doing here rolf what are you i only followed you chloe go away rolf whats the matter tell me chloe go away and dont say anything oh the roses she has put her nose into some roses in a bowl on a big stand close to the window dont they smell lovely rolf what did jill want this

her and does go chloe with a little moaning sound flutters again magpielike up and down then stands by the window listening voices are heard left she darts out of the window and away to the right as hillcrist and jill come in they have turned up the electric light and come down in frond of the fireplace where hillcrist sits in an armchair and jill on the arm of it they are in undress evening attire hillcrist now tell me jill there isnt much dodo i was in an awful funk for fear i should meet any of the others and of course i did meet rolf but i told him some lie and he took me to her roomboudoir they call it isnt boudoir a dugout word hillcrist meditatively the sulking room well jill she was sitting like this she buries her chin in her hands wide her elbows on her knees and she said in a sort of fierce way what do you want and i said im awfully sorry but i thought you might like it hillcrist well jill she looked at me hard and said i suppose you know all about it and i said only vaguely because of course i dont and she said well it was decent of you to come dodo she looks like a lost soul what has she done hillcrist she committed her real crime when she married young hornblower without telling him she came out of a certain world to do it jill oh staring in front of her is it very awful in that world dodo hillcrist uneasy i dont know jill some can stand it i suppose some cant i dont know which sort she is jill one thing im sure of shes awfully fond of chearlie hillcrist thats bad thats very bad jill and shes frightened horribly i think shes desperate hillcrist women like that are pretty tough jill dont judge her too much by your own feelings jill no onlyoh it was beastly and of course i dried up hillcrist feelingly hm one always does but perhaps it was as well youd have been blundering in a dark passage jill i just said father and i feel awfully sorry if theres anything we can do hillcrist that was risky jill jill disconsolately i had to say something im glad i went anyway i feel more human hillcrist we had to fight for our home i should have felt like a traitor if i hadnt jill im not enjoying home tonight dodo hillcrist i never could hate proper its a confounded nuisance jill mothers fearfully bucked and dawkers simply oozing triumph i dont trust him dodo hes too not pugilistic the other one with a pugnaceous hillcrist he is rather jill im sure he wouldnt care tuppence if chloe committed suicide hillcrist rising uneasily nonsense nonsense jill i wonder if mother would hillcrist turning his face towards the window whats that i thought i heard louder is these anybody out there no answer jill springs up and runs to the window jill you she dives through to the right and returns holding chloes hand and drawing her forward come in its only us to hillcrist dodo hillcrist flustered but making a show of courtesy good evening wont you sit down jill sit down youre all shaky she makes chloe sit down in the armchair out of which they have risen then locks the door and closing the windows draws the curtains hastily over them hillcrist awkward and expectant can i do anything for you chloe i couldnt bear it hes coming to ask you hillcrist who chloe my husband she draws in her breath with a long shudder then seem to seize her courage in her hands ive got to be quick he keeps on asking he knows theres something hillcrist make your mind easy we shant tell him chloe appealing oh thats not enough cant you tell him something to put him back to thinking its all right ive done him such a wrong i didnt realise till after i thought meeting him was just a piece of wonderful good luck after what id been through im not such a bad lot not really she stops from the overquivering of her lips jill standing beside the chair strokes her shoulder hillcrist stands very still painfully biting at a finger you see my father went bankrupt and i was in a shop hillcrist soothingly and to prevent disclosures yes yes yes yes chloe i never gave a man away or did anything i was ashamed of at least i mean i had to make my living in all sorts of ways and then i met charlie again she stopped from the quivering of her lips jill its all right chloe he thought i was respectable and that was such a relief you cant think so so i let him jill dodo its awful hillcrist it is chloe and after i married him you see i fell in love if i had before perhaps i wouldnt have dared only i dont know you never know do you when theres a straw going you catch at it jill of course you do chloe and now you see im going to have a child jill aghast oh are you hillcrist good god chloe dully ive been on hot bricks all this month ever since that day here i knew it was in the wind what gets in the wind never gets out she rises and throws out her arms never it just blows here and there desolately and then blows home her voice changes to resentment but ive paid for being a fool tisnt fun that sort of life i can tell you im not ashamed and repentant and all that if it wasnt for him im afraid hell never forgive me its such a disgrace for him and then to have his child being fond of him i feel it much worse than anything i ever felt and thats saying a good bit it is jill energetically look here he simply mustnt find out chloe thats it but its started and hes bound to keep on because he knows theres something a man isnt going to be satisfied when theres something he suspects about his wife charlie wouldnt never hes clever and hes jealous and hes coming here she stops and looks round wildly listening jill dodo what can we say to put him clean off the scent hillcrist anything in reason chloe catching at this straw you will you see i dont know what ill do ive got soft being looked after he does love me and if he throws me off ill go under thats all hillcrist have you any suggestion chloe eagerly the only thing is to tell him something positive something hell believe thats not too bad like my having been a lady clerk with those people who came here and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money i could get him to believe that wasnt true jill yes and it isnt thats splendid youd be able to put such conviction into it dont you think so dodo hillcrist anything i can im deeply sorry chloe thank you and dont say ive been here will you hes very suspicious you see he knows that his father has resold that land to you thats what he cant make out that and my coming here this morning he knows somethings being kept from him and he noticed that man with dawker yesterday and my maids been spying on me its in the air he puts two and two together but ive told him theres nothing he need worry about nothing thats true hillcrist what a coil chloe im very honest and careful about money so he wont believe that about me and the old man wants to keep it from charlie i know hillcrist that does seem the best way out chloe with a touch of defiance im a true wife to him chloe of course we know that hillcrist its all unspeakably sad deceptions horribly against the grain but chloe eagerly when i deceived him id have deceived god himself i was so desperate youve never been right down in the mud you cant understand what ive been through hillcrist yes yes i daresay id have done the same i should be the last to judge chloe covers her eyes with her hands there there cheer up he puts his hand on her arm chloe to herself darling dodo chloe starting theres somebody at the door i must go i must go she runs to the window and slips through the curtains the handle of the door is again turned jill dismayed oh its locked i forgot she spring to the door unlocks and opens it while hillcrist goes to the bureau and sits down its all right fellows i was only saying something rather important fellows coming in a step or two and closing the door behind him certainly miss mr charles ornblower is in the hall wants to see you sir or mrs hillcrist jill what a bore can you see him dodo hillcrist er yes

it the face of chloe is seen transfixed between the curtains parted by her hands she she put you up to it liar that she is a living lie for three years a living lie hillcrist whose face alone is turned towards the curtains sees that listening face his hand goes up from uncontrollable emotion and hasnt now the pluck to tell me ive done with her i wont own a child by such a woman with a little sighing sound chloe drops the curtain and vanishes hillcrist for gods sake man think of what youre saying shes in great distress charles and what am i jill she loves you you know charles pretty love
