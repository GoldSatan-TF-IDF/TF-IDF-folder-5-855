the golden bowl volume i henry james book first the prince part first i the prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a more convincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any they have left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city to which the world paid tribute he recognised in the present london much more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such a case if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense of that the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fine afternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed to either of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concerned with him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough into bond street where his imagination working at comparatively short range caused him now and then to stop before a window in which objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in the forms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbled together as if in the insolence of the empire they had been the loot of faroff victories the young mans movements however betrayed no consistency of attention not even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in faces shaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribboned hats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk of parasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and the princes undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of the streets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the august afternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was too restless that was the fact for any concentration and the last idea that would just now have occurred to him in any connection was the idea of pursuit he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was the sense of how he had been justified capture had crowned the pursuit or success as he would otherwise have put it had rewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things made him for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that might have consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blue eyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes to be observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before at three oclock his fate had practically been sealed and that even when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment had something of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lock that could be made there was nothing to do as yet further but feel what one had done and our personage felt it while he aimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married so definitely had the solicitors at three oclock enabled the date to be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant he was to dine at halfpast eight oclock with the young lady on whose behalf and on whose fathers the london lawyers had reached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poor calderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondrous situation of being shown london before promptly leaving it again by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with his millions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which the prince was during these minutes most struck was that of calderonis bestowal of his company for a view of the lions if there was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a soninlaw than lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves in that character he thought of these fellows from whom he was so to differ in english he used mentally the english term to describe his difference for familiar with the tongue from his earliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with him either for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life for the greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himself though not unmindful that there might still as time went on be others including a more intimate degree of that one that would seek possibly with violence the larger or the finer issue which was it of the vernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worse even to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speak french he had said intimating thus that there were discriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which that language was the most apt the girl had taken this she let him know as a reflection on her own french which she had always so dreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of his evident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was not a person to rise to the princes answer to such remarks genial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangement had yet had from him was that he was practising his american in order to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective fatherinlaw had a command of it he said that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besides which well besides which he had made to the girl the observation that positively of all his observations yet had most finely touched her you know i think hes a real galantuomo and no mistake there are plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best man ive ever seen in my life well my dear why shouldnt he be the girl had gaily inquired it was this precisely that had set the prince to think the things or many of them that had made mr verver what he was seemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the other things that with the other people known to the young man had failed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt fathers form she hadnt seen it it strikes me he hasnt got any he hasnt got mine he hasnt even got yours thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own ive made that out so dont doubt it its where it has brought him out thats the point its his goodness that has brought him out our young woman had at this objected ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when its real precisely rather keeps people in he had been interested in his discrimination which amused him no its his way it belongs to him but she had wondered still its the american way thats all exactly its all its all i say it fits him so it must be good for something do you think it would be good for you maggie verver had smilingly asked to which his reply had been just of the happiest i dont feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can now either hurt me or help me such as i am but youll see for yourself say however i am a galantuomo which i devoutly hope im like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your fathers the natural fowl running about the bassecour his feathers movements his sounds those are the parts that with me are left out all as a matter of course since you cant eat a chicken alive the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had been positive well im eating your father alive which is the only way to taste him i want to continue and as its when he talks american that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it to get my pleasure he couldnt make one like him so much in any other language it mattered little that the girl had continued to demur it was the mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him in chinese it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that hes a kind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordingly for the tone which has made him possible oh youll hear enough of it she laughed before youve done with us only this in truth had made him frown a little what do you mean please by my having done with you why found out about us all there is to find he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love i began with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised its you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really know nothing there are two parts of me yes he had been moved to go on one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have come to me those things are written literally in rows of volumes in libraries are as public as theyre abominable everybody can get at them and youve both of you wonderfully looked them in the face but theres another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportant unimportant save to you personal quantity about this youve found out nothing luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what then would become please of the promised occupation of my future the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clear he couldnt call it anything else she had looked in her prettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he had been moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught you know are the reigns without any history oh im not afraid of history she had been sure of that call it the bad part if you like yours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made me originally think of you it wasnt as i should suppose you must have seen what you call your unknown quantity your particular self it was the generations behind you the follies and the crimes the plunder and the waste the wicked pope the monster most of all whom so many of the volumes in your family library are all about if ive read but two or three yet i shall give myself up but the more as soon as i have time to the rest where therefore she had put it to him again without your archives annals infamies would you have been he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might have been in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actual situation under the head in question positively so little mattered to them that having by that time lived deep into the sense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girls rejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he now floated tinted them as by the action of some essence poured from a goldtopped phial for making ones bath aromatic no one before him never not even the infamous pope had so sat up to his neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how little one of his race could escape after all from history what was it but history and of their kind very much to have the assurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palacebuilder himself could have dreamed of this was the element that bore him up and into which maggie scattered on occasion her exquisite colouring drops they were of the colour of what on earth of what but the extraordinary american good faith they were of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time of her imagination with which their relation his and these peoples was all suffused what he had further said on the occasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoes from his own thoughts while he loitered what he had further said came back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans are almost incredibly romantic of course we are thats just what makes everything so nice for us everything he had wondered well everything thats nice at all the world the beautiful world or everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see so much he had looked at her a moment and he well knew how she had struck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of the beautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answered was you see too much thats what may sometimes make you difficulties when you dont at least he had amended with a further thought see too little but he had quite granted that he knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but there seemed somehow no follies in theirs nothing one was obliged to recognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss to themselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into the bargain was as bad that is as good as herself oh hes better the girl had freely declared that is hes worse his relation to the things he cares for and i think it beautiful is absolutely romantic so is his whole life over here its the most romantic thing i know you mean his idea for his native place yes the collection the museum with which he wishes to endow it and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything in the world its the work of his life and the motive of everything he does the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been his motive in letting me have you yes my dear positively or in a manner she had said american city isnt by the way his native town for though hes not old its a young thing compared with him a younger one he started there he has a feeling about it and the place has grown as he says like the programme of a charity performance youre at any rate a part of his collection she had explained one of the things that can only be got over here youre a rarity an object of beauty an object of price youre not perhaps absolutely unique but youre so curious and eminent that there are very few others like you you belong to a class about which everything is known youre what they call a morceau de musee i see i have the great sign of it he had risked that i cost a lot of money i havent the least idea she had gravely answered what you cost and he had quite adored for the moment her way of saying it he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made the best of that wouldnt you find out if it were a question of parting with me my value would in that case be estimated she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his value were well before her yes if you mean that id pay rather than lose you and then there came again what this had made him say dont talk about me its you who are not of this age youre a creature of a braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most golden hour wouldnt have been ashamed of you it would of me and if i didnt know some of the pieces your father has acquired i should rather fear for american city the criticism of experts would it at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety well we may have to come to it ill go anywhere you want we must see first it will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts away the bigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has already stored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain in warehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places weve been like a pair of pirates positively stage pirates the sort who wink at each other and say haha when they come to where their treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have about us these the smaller pieces are the things we take out and arrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houses we hire a little less ugly of course its a danger and we have to keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and its for the company of some of his things that hes willing to run his risks and weve had extraordinary luck maggie had made that point weve never lost anything yet and the finest objects are often the smallest values in lots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size but theres nothing however tiny she had wound up that weve missed i like the class he had laughed for this in which you place me i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at the hotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderful one and put out with the family photographs and the new magazines but its something not to be so big that i have to be buried oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear till youre dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to american city before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save for the result of an observation that had risen to his lips at the beginning which he had then checked and which now came back to him good bad or indifferent i hope theres one thing you believe about me he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken it gaily ah dont fix me down to one i believe things enough about you my dear to have a few left if most of them even go to smash ive taken care of that ive divided my faith into watertight compartments we must manage not to sink you do believe im not a hypocrite you recognise that i dont lie or dissemble or deceive is that watertight the question to which he had given a certain intensity had made her he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if it had sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he had perceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity of loyalty or rather of the want of them practically took her unprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed it before it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldnt be gone into so the note of his inquiry was well to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almost overdone drollery in which her answer instinctively sought refuge watertight the biggest compartment of all why its the best cabin and the main deck and the engineroom and the stewards pantry its the ship itself its the whole line its the captains table and all ones luggage ones reading for the trip she had images like that that were drawn from steamers and trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he was unable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries and facilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as to which it was part of the interest of his situation as it stood that he could quite without wincing feel his future likely to bristle with them it was in fact content as he was with his engagement and charming as he thought his affianced bride his view of that furniture that mainly constituted our young mans romance and to an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he was intelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feel quite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself in short against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth was his sense of this last danger which may illustrate moreover his general attitude toward dangers from within personally he considered he hadnt the vices in question and that was so much to the good his race on the other hand had had them handsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race its presence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnable scent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and the hair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemical bath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantly felt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatal history knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keep causes well before him what was his frank judgment of so much of its ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation of humility what was this so important step he had just taken but the desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old if what had come to him wouldnt do he must make something different he perfectly recognised always in his humility that the material for the making had to be mr ververs millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he had tried before had had to look about and see the truth humble as he was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had known himself frivolous or stupid he had an idea which may amuse his historian that when you were stupid enough to be mistaken about such a matter you did know it therefore he wasnt mistaken his future might be might be scientific there was nothing in himself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself to science for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation of archives he thought of these of his not being at all events futile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of the coming age to redress the balance of his being so differently considered the moments when he most winced were those at which he found himself believing that really futility would have been forgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would have been good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of the romantic spirit they didnt indeed poor dears know what in that line the line of futility the real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure this was a memory in fact simply to screen out much as just in front of him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing early to the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all about him was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their side if it wasnt rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they were on his something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmur of his walk it would have been ridiculous such a moral from such a source if it hadnt all somehow fitted to the gravity of the hour that gravity the oppression of which i began by recording another feature was the immediate nearness of the arrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them at charing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had married before him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion that had gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sister and her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternal uncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of exdeputies and of relatives a scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite of maggies plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to the altar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a more numerous muster than any possible to the bride herself having no wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on the other hand by loose invitations he had been interested in the girls attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of the kind of ruminations she would in general be governed by which were quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadnt natural relations she and her father she had explained so they wouldnt try to supply the place by artificial by makebelieve ones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they had acquaintances enough but a marriage was an intimate thing you asked acquaintances when you had your kith and kin you asked them over and above but you didnt ask them alone to cover your nudity and look like what they werent she knew what she meant and what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and he wasnt afraid of her having much he had had in his earlier time to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably with the three four ecclesiastics his greatuncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in his education the effect of all of which had never been to upset him he was thus fairly on the lookout for the characteristic in this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were in order as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done in his life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap it would open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of the romans it would even perhaps open with his dining tonight in portland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggesting that of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but what meanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of the immediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp as to its source while vague as to its end which i began by speaking of the consciousness of an appeal to do something or other before it was too late for himself by any friend to whom he might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned to frank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and the high advantages attached was he about to marry an extraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solid sort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasnt to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was so free to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before him after a little definitely the image of a friend whom he had often found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention from passing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth and beauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assingham made him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty were things more or less of the past but to find her at home as he possibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and thereby probably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particular pilgrimage she lived far enough off in long cadogan place was already in fact to work it off a little a perception of the propriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just as he happened to be doing this he made out as he went was obviously all that had been the matter with him it was true that he had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other way the other way from where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledges was in her pleasant person the force that had set them successively in motion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papal ancestor had made his family though he could scarce see what she had made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profitto think of it vulgarly must have all had to come from the ververs yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposing that she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure she hadnt for if there were people who took presents and people who didnt she would be quite on the right side and of the proud class only then on the other hand her disinterestedness was rather awful it implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggie whose possession of such a friend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but the great proof of her affection had been in bringing them with her design together meeting him during a winter in rome meeting him afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in time frankly let him know from the first she had marked him for her young friends own and had then unmistakably presented him in a light but the interest in maggie that was the point would have achieved but little without her interest in him on what did that sentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good again for it was much like his question about mr verver should he ever have done her the princes notion of a recompense to women similar in this to his notion of an appeal was more or less to make love to them now he hadnt as he believed made love the least little bit to mrs assingham nor did he think she had for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to mark them off the women to whom he hadnt made love it represented and that was what pleased him in it a different stage of existence from the time at which he liked to mark off the women to whom he had neither with all this had mrs assingham herself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things the motives of such people were obscure a little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which alone slightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he remembered to have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe his prospective wifes countrymanwhich was a thing to show by the way what imagination americans could have the story of the shipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat further toward the north pole or was it the south than anyone had ever done found at a given moment before him a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darkness conceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there were moments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assingham herself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had never known curtains but as purple even to blackness but as producing where they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they were so disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to be shocks shocks however from these quite different depths were not what he saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself not yet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month with the thought freshly determined or renewed of the general expectation to define it roughly of which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectation of anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption of merits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value it was as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of gold no longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and half crowns would be great enough but as to which since there were finer ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to him to rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escape being reduced to his component parts what would this mean but that practically he was never to be tried or tested what would it mean but that if they didnt change him they really wouldnt know he wouldnt know himself how many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for the present were unanswerable questions all that was before him was that he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them that made them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite of her having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far as to break any charm what should he do if he were to ask her frankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind their veil it would come to asking what they expected him to do she would answer him probably oh you know its what we expect you to be on which he would have no resource but to deny his knowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasnt simply a question of fancy and pretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time and another of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say what they might would put him to the practical proof as the practical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate to the cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he was not honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was the shrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped in cadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch ii theyre not good days you know he had said to fanny assingham after declaring himself grateful for finding her and then with his cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest news the documents signed an hour ago de part et dautre and the telegram from his backers who had reached paris the morning before and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed to think the whole thing a tremendous lark were very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of the world london therefore will be more or less another planet it has always been as with so many of us quite their mecca but this is their first real caravan theyve mainly known old england as a shop for articles in indiarubber and leather in which theyve dressed themselves as much as possible which all means however that youll see them all of them wreathed in smiles we must be very easy with them maggies too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in the sposi and my uncle the others will come to me ive been engaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemn signatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me do you mean youre afraid his hostess had amusedly asked terribly afraid ive now but to wait to see the monster come theyre not good days theyre neither one thing nor the other ive really got nothing yet ive everything to lose one doesnt know what still may happen the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it was a sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead of soothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over in his mystic impatience to be told what he could understand and believe that was what he had come for marriage then said mrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit its a fearful thing at the best but for heavens sake if thats what youre thinking of dont run away from it ah to run away from it would be to run away from you the prince replied and ive already told you often enough how i depend on you to see me through he so liked the way she took this from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerity fuller expression im starting on the great voyage across the unknown sea my ships all rigged and appointed the cargos stowed away and the company complete but what seems the matter with me is that i cant sail alone my ship must be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters a what do you call it a consort i dont ask you to stay on board with me but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i dont in the least myself know i assure you the points of the compass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be my lead how can you be sure she asked where i should take you why from your having brought me safely thus far i should never have got here without you youve provided the ship itself and if youve not quite seen me aboard youve attended me ever so kindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in the next berth and you cant desert me now she showed him again her amusement which struck him even as excessive as if to his surprise he made her also a little nervous she treated him in fine as if he were not uttering truths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bobs and mine and thankful we are now to have it weve wandered far living as you may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles of our feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talk about rest its too selfish when youre just launching me on adventures she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid youve had yours as ive had mine and my idea has been all along that we should neither of us begin again my own last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettily mention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but theyre not the comparison your tossings are over youre practically in port the port she concluded of the golden isles he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words instead of certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to be left but what i came for of course was to thank you if today has seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feel how little there would have been any at all without you the first were wholly yours well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy ive seen them ive had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had the conception ah prince so had you he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had it most she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if thats what you mean but you liked it surely yourself i protest that i had easy work with you i had only at last when i thought it was time to speak for you all that is quite true but youre leaving me all the same youre leaving me youre washing your hands of me he went on however that wont be easy i wont be left and he had turned his eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had just described as her final refuge the place of peace for a worldworn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shall keep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you im not you know he declared going to give you up for anybody if youre afraid which of course youre not are you trying to make me the same she asked after a moment he waited a minute too then answered her with a question you say you liked it your undertaking to make my engagement possible it remains beautiful for me that you did its charming and unforgettable but still more its mysterious and wonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry if you havent by this time found out yourself what meaning can anything i say have for you dont you really after all feel she added while nothing came from him arent you conscious every minute of the perfection of the creature of whom ive put you into possession every minute gratefully conscious but thats exactly the ground of my question it wasnt only a matter of your handing me over it was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of her fate still more than of mine you thought all the good of her that one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying to frighten me ah thats a foolish view i should be too vulgar you apparently cant understand either my good faith or my humility im awfully humble the young man insisted thats the way ive been feeling today with everything so finished and ready and you wont take me for serious she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians there you are he returned its what i wanted you to come to thats the responsible note yes she went on if youre humble you must be dangerous she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i dont in the least want to lose sight of you but even if i did i shouldnt think it right thank you for that its what i needed of you im sure after all that the more youre with me the more i shall understand its the only thing in the world i want im excellent i really think all round except that im stupid i can do pretty well anything i see but ive got to see it first and he pursued his demonstration i dont in the least mind its having to be shown me in fact i like that better therefore it is that i want that i shall always want your eyes through them i wish to look even at any risk of their showing me what i maynt like for then he wound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are you talking about but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it thats what i shall always trust you for to tell me when i am no with you people its a sense we havent got it not as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of course she had always liked him i should be interested she presently remarked to see some sense you dont possess well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it ive of course something that in our poor dear backward old rome sufficiently passes for it but its no more like yours than the tortuous stone staircase halfruined into the bargain in some castle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator in one of mr ververs fifteenstorey buildings your moral sense works by steam it sends you up like a rocket ours is slow and steep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that its as short in almost any case to turn round and come down again trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way yes or not to have to get up at all however he added i told you that at the beginning machiavelli she simply exclaimed you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldnt say it but its all right he gaily enough concluded i shall always have you to come to on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all she would give him he promptly signified and he developed making her laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehow their morality made with boiling water in a little pot so that the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him several questions about his sister and the others questions as to what bob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do for the arriving gentlemen whom by the princes leave he would immediately go to see he was funny while they talked about his own people too whom he described with anecdotes of their habits imitations of their manners and prophecies of their conduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would ever have known this mrs assingham professed was exactly what would endear them to her and that in turn drew from her visitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being able so to depend on her he had been with her at this point some twenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and he stayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation he stayed moreover that was really the sign of the hour in spite of the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truth much rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparently meant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called it he felt that yet she was herself not at ease she had been nervous though trying to disguise it the sight of him following on the announcement of his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction for the young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling he had done even better than he intended for it was somehow important that was what it was that there should be at this hour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in all their acquaintance so considerable now there had never been the least little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it was to know of a truth that there was something the matter with him since strangely with so little to go upon his heart had positively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairly befell at last for a climax that they almost ceased to pretend to pretend that is to cheat each other with forms the unspoken had come up and there was a crisis neither could have said how long it lasted during which they were reduced for all interchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinate scale they might at this moment in their positively portentous stillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for their photograph or even enacting a tableauvivant the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy might have read meanings of his own into the intensity of their communion or indeed even without meanings have found his account aesthetically in some gratified play of our modern sense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modern sense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assinghams dark neat head on which the crisp black hair made waves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in the fashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminations against the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearance and to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middle age had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as a daughter of the south or still more of the east a creature formed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited upon by slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be to take up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugared fruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither a pampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she wore yellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than like a revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold in her teagown for the same reason it was her theory that nature itself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so she was covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toys and shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced to supply her friends these friends were in the game that of playing with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours of the world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she needed the warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american city looked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under the lids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her false leisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains she was a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail that left her as it at any moment found her unappalled and unwearied sophisticated as i may appear it was her frequent phrase she had found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life two great holes to fill and she described herself as dropping social scraps into them as she had known old ladies in her early american time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt one of these gaps in mrs assinghams completeness was her want of children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderful how little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathy and curiosity could render their objects practically filial just as an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like the rose colonel bob had a few years after his marriage left the army which had clearly by that time done its laudable all for the enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus give his whole time to the gardening in question there reigned among the younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerable for historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiest of its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitive period when such things such things as american girls accepted as good enough had not begun to be so that the pleasant pair had been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of a kind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontas down when some young englishman hadnt precipitately believed and some american girl hadnt with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but she accepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was in fact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplanted tribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bobs own it was he who had done that absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first odd glimmerresting upon it moreover through the years to come as proof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if she kept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should have full credit there were moments in truth when she privately felt how little striking out as he had done he could have afforded that she should show the common limits but mrs assinghams cleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at last said to her i dont think you know that youre treating me quite right youve something on your mind that you dont tell me it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind it isnt a question of everything but its a question of anything that may particularly concern me then you shouldnt keep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed taking everything into account and making no mistake that may possibly injure her mrs assingham at this had after an instant an odd interrogation her her and him both our friends either maggie or her father i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadnt been prepared but it isnt anything that properly concerns you the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what do you mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it its the way people put a thing when they put it well wrong i put things right what is it that has happened for me his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone oh i shall be delighted if youll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprise a transparency through which his eyes met his friends with a certain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked she appears to have arrived this noon coming up from southampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon and was here for more than an hour the young man heard with interest though not with an interest too great for his gaiety you think then ive a share in it what is my share why any you like the one you seemed just now eager to take it was you yourself who insisted he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and she could now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy i didnt know then what the matter was you didnt think it could be so bad do you call it very bad the young man asked only she smiled because thats the way it seems to affect you he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour still looking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed you were upset to the extent yes of not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to have done the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say something very natural and true no quite right maggie hasnt looked for her but im sure he added shell be delighted to see her that certainly and his hostess spoke with a different shade of gravity shell be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stant now gone to her she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here i cant have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel no i see if shes here at all she must stay with me he quite took it in so shes coming now i expect her at any moment if you wait youll see her oh he promptly declared charming but this word came out as if a little in sudden substitution for some other it sounded accidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly was what he next showed himself if it wasnt for whats going on these next days maggie would certainly want to have her in fact he lucidly continued isnt whats happening just a reason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer only looked at him and this the next instant had apparently had more effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question that seemed incongruous what has she come for it made his companion laugh why for just what you say for your marriage mine he wondered maggies its the same thing its for your great event and then said mrs assingham shes so lonely has she given you that as a reason i scarcely remember she gave me so many she abounds poor dear in reasons but theres one that whatever she does i always remember for myself and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess but couldnt why the fact that she has no home absolutely none whatever shes extraordinarily alone again he took it in and also has no great means very small ones which is not however with the expense of railways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro on the contrary but she doesnt like her country hers my dear man its little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded now but she has had little enough else to do with it oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assure you as if the great place already more or less belonged to me thats your good fortune and your point of view you own or you soon practically will own so much of it charlotte owns almost nothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunksonly one of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house shell depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he had always his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has she come with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even this were almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to do with himself estelle toujours aussi belle that was the furthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could be relegated mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person in the world to my sense whose looks are most subject to appreciation its all in the way she affects you one admires her if one doesnt happen not to so as well one criticises her ah thats not fair said the prince to criticise her then there you are youre answered im answered he took it humorously as his lesson sank his previous selfconsciousness with excellent effect in grateful docility i only meant that there are perhaps better things to be done with miss stant than to criticise her when once you begin that with anyone he was vague and kind i quite agree that its better to keep out of it as long as one can but when one must do it yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean i see perhaps he smiled i dont know what i mean well its what just now in all ways you particularly should know mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone she had just used i quite understand of course that given her great friendship with maggie she should have wanted to be present she has acted impulsively but she has acted generously she has acted beautifully said the prince i say generously because i mean she hasnt in any way counted the cost shell have it to count in a manner now his hostess continued but that doesnt matter he could see how little youll look after her ill look after her so its all right its all right said mrs assingham then why are you troubled it pulled her up but only for a minute im not any more than you the princes dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of a roman palace of an historic front by one of the great old designers thrown open on a feastday to the golden air his look itself at such times suggested an image that of some very noble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in the street and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for his support had gaily and gallantly come to show himself always moreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators and subjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically to be considered the young mans expression became after this fashion something vivid and concrete a beautiful personal presence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense of a function it had been happily said of his face that the figure thus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudest ancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the prince was for mrs assinghams benefit in view of the people he seemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day he looked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague oh well im not he rang out clear i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldnt have a shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would have been at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thus made as important as if some danger of its opposite had directly menaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of their cheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explain her original manner and she came to this before they dropped the question my first impulse is always to behave about everything as if i feared complications but i dont fear them i really like them theyre quite my element he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if were not in the presence of a complication she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one is always a complication the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new to him and will she stay very long his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know ive scarcely asked her ah yes you cant but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you think you could i he wondered do you think you could get it out of her for me the probable length of her stay he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge i daresay if you were to give me the chance here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door shes back iii it had been said as a joke but as after this they awaited their friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turn the time to gravity a gravity not dissipated even when the prince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and making up his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was a complication mrs assingham so far was right but there were the facts the good relations from schooldays of the two young women and the clear confidence with which one of them had arrived she can come you know at any time to us mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter youd like her for your honeymoon oh no you must keep her for that but why not after she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice in the corridor they had got up why not youre splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in as she had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alone this would have been to be noticed by the butlers answer on the stairs to a question put to him she could have looked at her hostess with such straightness and brightness only from knowing that the prince was also there the discrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her in still better than if she had instantly faced him he availed himself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of all these things what he accordingly saw for some seconds with intensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him at first exactly the look of her adventurous situation a suggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from the becoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and customhouses of far countries and long journeys the knowledge of how and where and the habit founded on experience of not being afraid he was aware at the same time that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was now sufficiently familiar with englishspeaking types he had sounded attentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision of differences he had besides his own view of this young ladys strength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but it would never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in her for she threw it out positively on the spot like a light that she might have reappeared during these moments just to cool his worried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holding aloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed him everything above all her presence in the world so closely so irretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even than that of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate and controlled way with those others facial physiognomic that mrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that was the connection they instantly established with him if they had to be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was but one way certainly for him to interpret them in the sense of the already known making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was too narrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on the other hand by no means small with substance in its lips and a slight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solid teeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but it was strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that these things in charlotte stant now affected him items in a full list items recognised each of them as if for the long interval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put away in a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of the cabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving him time he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciation a colour indescribable and of which he had known no other case something that gave her at moments the sylvan head of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to her wrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be of the completely rounded the polished slimness that florentine sculptors in the great time had loved and of which the apparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and old bronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers and the shape and colour of her fingernails he knew her special beauty of movement and line when she turned her back and the perfect working of all her main attachments that of some wonderful finished instrument something intently made for exhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinary fineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a fingerring that held it together it was as if before she turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his open palm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when she did turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he might have been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming upon him save so far as the intelligence in her face could at any moment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she moved off she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearer like his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but what she said was simply you see youre not rid of me how is dear maggie it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation of chance the young mans opportunity to ask her the question suggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance the license had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutes all there the license given him literally to inquire of this young lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matter of the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assinghams part a withdrawal of a few moments which had the effect of leaving her visitors free mrs bettermans there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of the household who was to have received her and seen her belongings settled to which charlotte had replied that she had encountered only the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecated any action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs bettermans nonappearance than could meet the casual eye what she saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of an earnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wail over the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware at this moment that departure for himself was indicated the question of miss stants installation didnt demand his presence it was a case for one to go away if one hadnt a reason for staying he had a reason however of that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious and intentional than not quickly to take leave his visible insistence for it came to that even demanded of him a certain disagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associated with acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to find out something something he wanted much to know and to find it out not tomorrow not at some future time not in short with waiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a little with the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assinghams own he wouldnt have admitted that he was staying to ask a rude question there was distinctly nothing rude in his having his reasons it would be rude for that matter to turn ones back without a word or two on an old friend well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assinghams preoccupation was practically simplifying the little crisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he was somehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that he had not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried was the kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was the kind of dignity and why couldnt he have dignity when he had so much of the good conscience as it were on which such advantages rested he had done nothing he oughtnt he had in fact done nothing at all once more as a man conscious of having known many women he could assist as he would have called it at the recurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always as certain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doing by the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infallibly she couldnt possibly not do it it was her nature it was her life and the man could always expect it without lifting a finger this was his the mans any mans position and strength that he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right just so the punctuality of performance on the part of the other creature was her weakness and her deep misfortune not less no doubt than her beauty it produced for the man that extraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relation with her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted and gave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always nice to her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her act up of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showing in fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but one thing in the world equal to her abjection she would let it be known for anything for everything but the truth of which it was made that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doing now that was the present motive and support to a certainty of each of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman she was possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrange appearances and what now concerned him was to learn how she proposed he would help her would arrange with her to any point in reason the only thing was to know what appearance could best be produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on her part of course since on his own there had been luckily no folly to cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct and obligation they stood there together at all events when the door had closed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile and very much as if each waited for the other to strike the note or give the pitch the young man held himself in his silent suspense only not more afraid because he felt her own fear she was afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he would do so their queer minute without words told him and she would act accordingly but what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything everything for her as honourably easy as possible even if she should throw herself into his arms he would make that easy easy that is to overlook to ignore not to remember and not by the same token either to regret this was not what in fact happened though it was also not at a single touch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided its too delightful to be back she said at last and it was all she definitely gave him being moreover nothing but what anyone else might have said yet with two or three other things that on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removed as need have been from the truth of her situation the abjection that was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peep out and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she could be trusted to arrange good it was all he asked and all the more that he could admire and like her for it the particular appearance she would as they said go in for was that of having no account whatever to give him it would be in fact that of having none to give anybody of reasons or of motives of comings or of goings she was a charming young woman who had met him before but she was also a charming young woman with a life of her own she would take it high up up up ever so high well then he would do the same no height would be too great for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a young person so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when after another moment she came as near as she was to come to an apology for her abruptness ive been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her i wanted to see her happy and it doesnt strike me i find you too shy to tell me i shall of course shes happy thank god only its almost terrible you know the happiness of young good generous creatures it rather frightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints said the prince have her in their keeping certainly they have shes the dearest of the dear but i neednt tell you the girl added ah he returned with gravity i feel that ive still much to learn about her to which he subjoined shell rejoice awfully in your being with us oh you dont need me charlotte smiled its her hour its a great hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why ive wanted i mean not to miss it he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustnt miss anything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was the happiness of his wife that was to be the sight of that happiness as a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not the less so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as nobly exalted something in charlottes eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find in it he was eager and he tried to show her that too to find what she liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendship had been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of young imagination young generosity it had been he believed always counting out her intense devotion to her father the liveliest emotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspired by himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object of it to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for a matter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh ive been writing to charlotte i wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he could still be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitous element in maggies wish which he had failed as yet to indicate to her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate why shouldnt charlotte respond and be quite free to respond to such fidelities with something more than mere formal good manners the relations of women with each other were of the strangest it was true and he probably wouldnt have trusted here a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughout on the ground of the immense difference difficult indeed as it might have been to disembroil in this young person her racequality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare a special product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd precious neutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware a sort of small social capital it was the only one she had it was the only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it and since this one indeed had compassed it but through the play of some gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definite name it wasnt a question of her strange sense for tongues with which she juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoops or lighted brands it wasnt at least entirely that for he had known people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment had quite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself for that matter as was the case too with so many of his friends and relations for none of whom more than for himself was it anything but a common convenience the point was that in this young woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfect felicity in the use of italian he had known strangers a few and mostly men who spoke his own language agreeably but he had known neither man nor woman who showed for it charlottes almost mystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of their acquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were their inevitable medium he had perceived all by accident by hearing her talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternative as good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusement for him was greater in watching her for the slips that never came her account of the mystery didnt suffice her recall of her birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents from the great country but themselves already of a corrupt generation demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servants of the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girls and the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabby but still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscan hills the convent shabbier than almost anything else but prettier too in which she had been kept at school till the subsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution in paris at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and as a smaller girl three years before her own ending of her period of five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but they had not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civil ancestor generations back and from the tuscan hills if she wouldmade himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in her tone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken his theory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presents that make friendship flourish these matters however all melted together now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned not unnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise that his discretion let him articulate you havent i rather gather particularly liked your country they would stick for the time to their english it doesnt i fear seem particularly mine and it doesnt in the least matter over there whether one likes it or not that is to anyone but ones self but i didnt like it said charlotte stant thats not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on do you mean because youre going oh yes of course were going ive wanted immensely to go she hesitated but now immediately in a month or two it seems to be the new idea on which there was something in her face as he imagined that made him say didnt maggie write to you not of your going at once but of course you must go and of course you must stay charlotte was easily clear as long as possible is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long as possible well it seemed to me so but i hadnt interests youll have them on a great scale its the country for interests said charlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldnt have left it he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours then are rather here oh mine the girl smiled they take up little room wherever they are it determined in him the way this came from her and what it somehow did for herit determined in him a speech that would have seemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it as really a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by its license to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery ive been thinking it all the while so probable you know that you would have seen your way to marrying she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds he feared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom why some good kind clever rich american again his security hung in the balance then she was as he felt admirable i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i had come quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much at any rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would have me then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear of her anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence you know all the same doesnt depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband oh existence the prince vaguely commented you think i ought to argue for more than mere existence she asked i dont see why my existence even reduced as much as you like to being merely mine should be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to have things i should be able to be the position of a single woman today is very favourable you know favourable to what why just to existence which may contain after all in one way and another so much it may contain at the worst even affections affections in fact quite particularly fixed that is on ones friends im extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were married to one of the people you speak of the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more ah but it isnt is it she asked a question of that my dear friend he returned its always a question of doing the best for ones self one can without injury to others he felt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis so he went on again as if to show frankly his sense of its firmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that youll marry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that such a marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it than even the spirit of the age she looked at him at first only for answer and would have appeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared a little more to take it with gaiety thank you very much she simply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte for reassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much i shall still marry some good person whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince was himself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in a word that was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke its only he explained to their hostess because of what miss stant has been telling me dont we want to keep up her courage if the joke was broad he had at least not begun it not that is as a joke which was what his companions address to their friend made of it she has been trying in america she says but hasnt brought it off the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected but she made the best of it well then she replied to the young man if you take such an interest you must bring it off and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbed as youve helped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressed herself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your marriage is on friday on saturday oh on friday no for what do you take us theres not a vulgar omen were neglecting on saturday please at the oratory at three oclock before twelve assistants exactly twelve including me it struck him he laughed youll make the thirteenth it wont do not said charlotte if youre going in for omens should you like me to stay away dear no well manage well make the round number well have in some old woman they must keep them there for that dont they mrs assinghams return had at last indicated for him his departure he had possessed himself again of his hat and approached her to take leave but he had another word for charlotte i dine tonight with mr verver have you any message the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver for maggie about her seeing you early that i know is what shell like then ill come early thanks i daresay he went on shell send for you i mean send a carriage oh i dont require that thanks i can go for a penny cant i she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at her blandly yes love and ill give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought of something else theres a great favour prince that i want to ask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie a marriagepresent oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed ah but i must she went on its really almost for that i came back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want but the girl looked only at their companion thats what the prince if hell be so good must help me to decide cant i mrs assingham asked help you to decide certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept her eyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go with me to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if you can spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean he raised his eyebrows at her he wonderfully smiled what you came back from america to ask ah certainly then i must find the hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more after all than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so little with the rest that directly for him it wasnt the note of safety it preserved this character at the best but by being the note of publicity quickly quickly however the note of publicity struck him as better than any other in another moment even it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much as publicity put their relation on the right footing by this appeal to mrs assingham it was established as right and she immediately showed that such was her own understanding certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour and it was really so express a license from her as representing friendly judgment public opinion the moral law the margin allowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observing to charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morning he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure with the absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it to himself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visit for he was where he could stay iv i dont quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wife the night of charlottes arrival i dont quite see im bound to say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isnt your fault after all is it ill be hanged at any rate if its mine the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked at southampton that morning to come up by the steamer special and who had then settled herself at an hotel only to resettle herself a couple of hours later at a private house was by this time they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather battered brothersinarms of his own period casually picked up by her host the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawingroom charlotte pleading fatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after eleven mrs assingham though finally quite without illusions as she said about the military character was always beguiling to old soldiers and as the colonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he had not till this moment really been summoned to meet his companion over the situation that as he was now to learn their visitors advent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels had ceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted from him presented themselves for the moment as the essence of his spirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if he didnt they were both phrases he repeatedly used his responsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging of men he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife had once told him in relation to his violence of speech that such excesses on his part made her think of a retired general whom she had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winning battles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with little fortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husbands exaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his military game it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous and arrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it was natural it was delightful the romance and for her as well of camp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fighting to the end to the death but no one was ever killed less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth of expression he had not yet found the image that described her favourite game all he could do was practically to leave it to her emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat up late to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousness abounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might be in fifty at once if she liked and it was what women did like at their ease after all there always being when they had too much of any some man as they were well aware to get them out he wouldnt at any price have one of any sort whatever of his own or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he had sometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in a slight though tight bathingsuit turned somersaults and did tricks in the tank of water which looked so cold and uncomfortable to the nonamphibious he listened to his companion tonight while he smoked his last pipe he watched her through her demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it was true that this being the case he desired the value of his money what was it in the name of wonder that she was so bent on being responsible for what did she pretend was going to happen and what at the worst could the poor girl do even granting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for that matter could she be conceived to have in her head if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assingham replied i shouldnt have my difficulty in finding out but she wasnt so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so whats certain is that she didnt come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisure to see the prince again that isnt what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isnt but what i ask myself is what does she want it for whats the good of asking yourself if you know you dont know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting on the other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance of an extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neat integument of finespun black silk and patent leather it seemed to confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straight and tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as to imply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadnt been just as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by a leanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physical laxity which might have been determined on the part of superior powers by views of transport and accommodation and which in fact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as his friends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with a consequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice of queer light shades and of strange strawlike textures of the aspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources of supply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continual canebottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its white hair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and the bristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun the hollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes within them were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he knew everything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement his wife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectual reaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and it didnt at all matter since he could be in spite of the limitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities the predicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him and indeed which was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results and chances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaigns of cruelty and license have had such revelations and known such amazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was wholly content in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion for the superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could deal with things perfectly for all his needs without getting near them this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion of whose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for their general economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was his club which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration his connection with it was really a masterpiece of editing this was in fact to come back very much the process he might have been proposing to apply to mrs assinghams view of what was now before them that is to their connection with charlotte stants possibilities they wouldnt lavish on them all their little fortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldnt spend their cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he felt as with her instincts that made against waste much more of his own sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almost better than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however he made at present the best of the latter necessity even to the pressing of the question he has been noted as having last uttered if you cant think what to be afraid of wait till you can think then youll do it much better or otherwise if thats waiting too long find out from her dont try to find out from me ask her herself mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play of mind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only as if they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facial movements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yet there was no one to whom she talked so persistently of such intimate things its her friendship with maggie thats the immense complication because that she audibly mused is so natural then why cant she have come out for it she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate because she hates america there was no place for her there she didnt fit in she wasnt in sympathy no more were the people she saw then its hideously dear she cant on her means begin to live there not at all as she can in a way here in the way you mean of living with us of living with anyone she cant live by visits alone and she doesnt want to shes too good for it even if she could but she will she must sooner or later stay with them maggie will want her maggie will make her besides shell want to herself then why wont that do the colonel asked for you to think its what she has come for how will it do how she went on as without hearing him thats what one keeps feeling why shouldnt it do beautifully that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you ever seen anything of yours anything that youve done not do ah i didnt do this it brought her answer straight i didnt bring her back did you expect her to stay over there all her days to oblige you not a bit for i shouldnt have minded her coming after their marriage its her coming this way before to which she added with inconsequence im too sorry for her of course she cant enjoy it but i dont see what perversity rides her she neednt have looked it all so in the face as she doesnt do it i suppose simply for discipline its almost thats the bore of it discipline to me perhaps then said bob assingham thats what has been her idea take it for gods sake as discipline to you and have done with it it will do he added for discipline to me as well she was far however from having done with it it was a situation with such different sides as she said and to none of which one could in justice be blind it isnt in the least you know for instance that i believe shes bad never never mrs assingham declared i dont think that of her then why isnt that enough nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she should develop her thought she doesnt deliberately intend she doesnt consciously wish the least complication its perfectly true that she thinks maggie a dear as who doesnt shes incapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here she is and there they are she wound up her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in the world between them ever took place between charlotte and the prince why nothing except their having to recognise that nothing could that was their little romance it was even their little tragedy but what the deuce did they do do they fell in love with each other but seeing it wasnt possible gave each other up then where was the romance why in their frustration in their having the courage to look the facts in the face what facts the colonel went on well to begin with that of their neither of them having the means to marry if she had had even a little a little i mean for two i believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she corrected herself i mean if he himself had had only a little or a little more than a little a little for a prince they would have done what they could she did them justice if there had been a way but there wasnt a way and charlotte quite to her honour i consider understood it he had to have money it was a question of life and death it wouldnt have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauper i mean leaving him one that was what she had as he had the reason to see and their reason is what you call their romance she looked at him a moment what do you want more didnt he the colonel inquired want anything more or didnt for that matter poor charlotte herself she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that half answered they were thoroughly in love she might have been his she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she liked except his wife but she wasnt said the colonel very smokingly she wasnt mrs assingham echoed the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room he seemed to listen to it die away then he began again how are you sure she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasnt time he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected some other does it take so much time she herself however remained serious it takes more than they had he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with their time after which as remembering it all living it over and piecing it together she only considered you mean that you came in with your idea he demanded it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measure to answer herself not a bit of it then but you surely recall she went on the way a year ago everything took place they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie why hadnt he heard of her from charlotte herself because she had never spoken of her is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you im not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me thats one thing im speaking of what i know by myself thats another you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assingham more sociably asked she neglected the question treating it as gross she never so much at the time as named maggie it was so positive that it appeared to strike him its he then who has told you she after a moment admitted it its he and he doesnt lie no to do him justice i believe he absolutely doesnt if i hadnt believed it mrs assingham declared for her general justification i would have had nothing to do with him that is in this connection hes a gentleman i mean all as much of one as he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps she added even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to him a year from last may he had never heard of her before then its grave said the colonel she hesitated do you mean grave for me oh that everythings grave for you is what we take for granted and are fundamentally talking about its grave it was for charlotte and its grave for maggie that is it was when he did see her or when she did see him you dont torment me as much as you would like she presently went on because you think of nothing that i havent a thousand times thought of and because i think of everything that you never will it would all she recognised have been grave if it hadnt all been right you cant make out she contended that we got to rome before the end of february he more than agreed theres nothing in life my dear that i can make out well there was nothing in life apparently that she at real need couldnt charlotte who had been there that year from early quite from november left suddenly youll quite remember about the th of april she was to have stayed on she was to have stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to have stayed all the more that the ververs due all winter but delayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were coming that is maggie was largely to see her and above all to be with her there it was all altered by charlottes going to florence she went from one day to the other you forget everything she gave her reasons but i thought it odd at the time i had a sense that something must have happened the difficulty was that though i knew a little i didnt know enough i didnt know her relation with him had been as you say a near thing that is i didnt know how near the poor girls departure was a flight she went to save herself he had listened more than he showed as came out in his tone to save herself well also really i think to save him too i saw it afterwards i see it all now he would have been sorry he didnt want to hurt her oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally dont at all events his wife pursued she escaped they both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldnt be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines between them the better it had taken them it is true some time to feel this and to find it out they had met constantly and not always publicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imagined though i dont know what difference it would after all have made with me i liked him i thought him charming from the first of our knowing him and now after more than a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there are things he might have done things that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowing i was going to so i havent and she stated it as she might have quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of a column of figures so i havent i say to myself been a fool well are you trying to make out that ive said you have all their case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is that you should leave it well alone its theirs now theyve bought it over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to be yours of which case she asked are you speaking he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many theres maggies and the princes and theres the princes and charlottes oh yes and then the colonel scoffed theres charlottes and the princes theres maggies and charlottes she went on and theres also maggies and mine i think too that theres charlottes and mine yes she mused charlottes and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said to keep my head are we to settle them all he inquired tonight i should lose it if things had happened otherwise if i had acted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldnt be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alone charlotte after their days with her in florence had decided about america maggie i daresay had helped her she must have made her a present and a handsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didnt know at the moment all that was behind it but i felt in it nevertheless the undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it cleared that air i mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field free it gave me a free hand there was no question for me of anybody else when i brought the two others together more than that there was no question for them so you see she concluded where that puts me she got up on the words very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and the elation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shoots at last into the open she turned about the room she looked out a moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly as if she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of her operation had been almost unexpectedly a success old arithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled the question her husband oddly however kept his place without apparently measuring these results as he had been amused at her intensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interest might in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do you mean he presently asked that he had already forgot about charlotte she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturally and it was much the best thing he could do she was in possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had it all now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us shes very nice but she always seems to me more than anything else the young woman who has a million a year if you mean that thats what she especially seemed to him you of course place the thing in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldnt i grant you have been so difficult this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didnt from the first i never said that he doesnt more and more like maggies money i never said i shouldnt have liked it myself bob assingham returned he made no movement he smoked another minute how much did maggie know how much she seemed to consider as if it were between quarts and gallons how best to express the quantity she knew what charlotte in florence had told her and what had charlotte told her very little what makes you so sure why this that she couldnt tell her and she explained a little what she meant there are things my dear havent you felt it yourself coarse as you are that no one could tell maggie there are things that upon my word i shouldnt care to attempt to tell her now the colonel smoked on it shed be so scandalised shed be so frightened shed be in her strange little way so hurt she wasnt born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which in fact fixed his wife before him were taking grand ways to prevent it but she stood there to protest were not taking any ways the ways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up to our carriage that day in villa borghese the second or third of her days in rome when as you remember you went off somewhere with mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriage with us came home with us to tea they had met they had seen each other well they were in relation the rest was to come of itself and as it could it began practically i recollect in our drive maggie happened to learn by some other mans greeting of him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as we passed that one of the princes baptismal names the one always used for him among his relations was amerigo which as you probably dont know however even after a lifetime of me was the name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing man who followed across the sea in the wake of columbus and succeeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather or namefather to the new continent so that the thought of any connection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts the colonels grim placidity could always quite adequately meet his wifes not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the score of the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and these dark depths were even at the present moment not directly lighted by an inquiry that managed to be curious without being apologetic but where does the connection come in his wife was prompt by the women that is by some obliging woman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man the makebelieve discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckily able to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other family had become great great enough at least to marry into his and the name of the navigator crowned with glory was very naturally to become so the fashion among them that some son of every generation was appointed to wear it my point is at any rate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was from the start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it the connection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague by that sign i quite said to myself hell conquer with his good fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine side of the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovely note for the candour of the ververs the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic he knew amerigo what he was about and i dont mean the old one i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off the old one he pointed his effect isnt the only discoverer in the family oh as much as you like if he discovered america or got himself honoured as if he had his successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are wouldnt this be the same one the colonel asked who really discovered what you call the connection she gave him a look the connections a true thing the connections perfectly historic your insinuations recoil upon your cynical mind dont you understand she asked that the history of such people is known root and branch at every moment of its course oh its all right said bob assingham go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit and what am i to do there theres a whole immense room or recess or department or whatever filled with books written about his family alone you can see for yourself have you seen for your self she faltered but an instant certainly i went one day with maggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil and she fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the princes drive with us my only course afterwards had to be to make the best of it it was certainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didnt in the least see my duty in making the worst in the same situation today i wouldnt act differently i entered into the case as it then appeared to me and as for the matter of that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of good of it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else nothing can ever make you think anything you dont want to the colonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe youve got a precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately different things what happened he went on was that you fell violently in love with the prince yourself and that as you couldnt get me out of the way you had to take some roundabout course you couldnt marry him any more than charlotte could that is not to yourself but you could to somebody else it was always the prince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive ones and all excellent all charming she spoke with an absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring of her conduct and this abstention clearly and effectively conscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are the things god grant that it will always be that i could help a year ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to make me happy then why arent you quiet i am quiet said fanny assingham he looked at her with his colourless candour still in his place she moved about again a little emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlotte couldnt tell her all what do you make of it that the prince didnt tell her anything say one understands that there are things she cant be told since as you put it she is so easily scared and shocked he produced these objections slowly giving her time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry if there hadnt been anything there shouldnt have been between the pair before charlotte bolted in order precisely as you say that there shouldnt be why in the world was what there had been too bad to be spoken of mrs assingham after this question continued still to circulate not directly meeting it even when at last she stopped i thought you wanted me to be quiet so i do and im trying to make you so much so that you wont worry more cant you be quiet on that she thought a moment then seemed to try to relate that she had to bolt for the reasons we speak of even though the bolting had done for her what she wished that i can perfectly feel charlottes not wanting to do ah then if it has done for her what she wished but the colonels conclusion hung by the if which his wife didnt take up so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again all one wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him say she hasnt come back to him not really to him ill say anything you like but that wont do me the same good as your saying it nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you dont care for anything in itself you care for nothing but to be grossly amused because i dont keep washing my hands i thought your whole argument was that everything is so right that this is precisely what you do but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go on as she had gone on before youre perfectly indifferent really youre perfectly immoral youve taken part in the sack of cities and im sure youve done dreadful things yourself but i dont trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poor charlotte back her to know what she wants ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girls behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she had groped through their talk for the thread and now she had got it she wants to be magnificent she is said the colonel almost cynically she wants his wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and shes capable of that of wanting to of carrying out her idea and what is her idea to see maggie through bob assingham wondered through what through everything she knows the prince and maggie doesnt no dear thing mrs assingham had to recognise it she doesnt so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she has done this great thing for him that is a year ago she practically did it she practically at any rate helped him to do it himself and helped me to help him she kept off she stayed away she left him free and what moreover were her silences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken in florence if she had told her own poor story if she had come back at any time till within a few weeks ago if she hadnt gone to new york and hadnt held out there if she hadnt done these things all that has happened since would certainly have been different therefore shes in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved even again her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesnt she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it was but the deeper drop therefore to her husbands flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then if shes in danger there is danger there wont be with charlottes understanding of it thats where she has had her conception of being able to be heroic of being able in fact to be sublime she is she will be the good lady by this time glowed so she sees it to become for her best friend an element of positive safety bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call her best friend she gave a toss of impatience ill leave you to discover but the grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted its for us therefore to be hers hers you and i its for us to be charlottes its for us on our side to see her through through her sublimity through her noble lonely life only thats essential it mustnt be lonely it will be all right if she marries so were to marry her were to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued the great thing i can do she made it out more and more it will make up make up for what as she said nothing however his desire for lucidity renewed itself if everythings so all right what is there to make up for why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if i made a mistake youll make up for it by making another and then as she again took her time i thought your whole point is just that youre sure one can never be ideally sure of anything there are always possibilities then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling it made her again look at him where would you have been my dear if i hadnt meddled with you ah that wasnt meddling i was your own i was your own said the colonel from the moment i didnt object well these people wont object they are my own too in the sense that im awfully fond of them also in the sense she continued that i think theyre not so very much less fond of me our relation all round exists its a reality and a very good one were mixed up so to speak and its too late to change it we must live in it and with it therefore to see that charlotte gets a good husband as soon as possible that as i say will be one of my ways of living it will cover she said with conviction all the ground and then as his own conviction appeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean of any nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my duty and i shant rest till my dutys performed she had arrived by this time at something like exaltation i shall give for the next year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have done in that case what i can he took it at last as it came you hold theres no limit to what you can i dont say theres no limit or anything of the sort i say there are good chances enough of them for hope why shouldnt there be when a girl is after all all that she is by after all you mean after shes in love with somebody else the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designed to be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up shes not too much in love not herself to want to marry she would now particularly like to has she told you so not yet its too soon but she will meanwhile however i dont require the information her marrying will prove the truth and what truth the truth of everything i say prove it to whom well to myself to begin with that will be enough for me to work for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently went on will be that shes cured that she accepts the situation he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe the situation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem to cover her tracks his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last he was merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will really make new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her her chance to be magnificent he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the same token yours to be magnificent with her i shall be as magnificent at least as i can bob assingham got up and you call me immoral she hesitated ill call you stupid if you prefer but stupidity pushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so what is morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tell her which left her more definitely to conclude besides its all at the worst great fun oh if you simply put it at that his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldnt catch her by it oh i dont mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean goodnight in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gave an odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant some particular kind v well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got into the park i dont want to pretend and i cant pretend a moment longer you may think of me what you will but i dont care i knew i shouldnt and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as under the influence of her tone the prince had already come to a pause for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicated were vague to him or were rather a quantity that couldnt at the most be much it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in the night and though the pavements were now dry thanks to a cleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thickdrifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey the multitudinous green of the park had been deepened and a wholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and of odours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had looked about her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the day was even in the heart of london of a rich lowbrowed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting for her as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were in fact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was the case the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vague italian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an american as indeed you had to be blessedly an american for all sorts of things so long as you hadnt blessedly or not to remain in america the prince had by halfpast ten as also by definite appointment called in cadogan place for mrs assinghams visitor and then after brief delay the two had walked together up sloane street and got straight into the park from knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken its place after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on the appeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assinghams drawingroom it was an appeal the couple of days had done nothing to invalidate everything much rather to place in a light and as to which obviously it wouldnt have fitted that anyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed and apparently not disapproving didnt intervene this the young man had asked himself with a very sufficient sense of what would have made him ridiculous he wasnt going to begin that at least was certain by showing a fear even had fear at first been sharp in him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have called it had been the effect of this rapid interval the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of his own weddingguests and by maggies scarce less absorbed entertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours together in portland place whom she had not as wouldnt have been convenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who had been present with other persons his contingent at luncheon at tea at dinner at perpetual repasts he had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eating whenever he had looked in if he had not again till this hour save for a minute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while he had not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen even maggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldnt have seen charlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail of the others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficiently enabled the girl to remind him so ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it at all everyone had brought gifts his relations had brought wonders how did they still have where did they still find such treasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yet even by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldnt be put off she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged the minute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and then to risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he might hurt her hurt her pride if she had that particular sort but she might as well be hurt one way as another and besides that particular sort of pride was just what she hadnt so his slight resistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not to be impossible i hate to encourage you and for such a purpose after all to spend your money she had stood a stair or two below him where while she looked up at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbed with her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which was mounted on fine ironwork eighteenthcentury english because you think i must have so little ive enough at any rate enough for us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good as a feast and then she had said it isnt of course a question of anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is it isnt a question of competing or outshining what naturally in the way of the priceless hasnt she got mine is to be the offering of the poor something precisely that no rich person could ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buy it she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as if after so much thought only as it cant be fine it ought to be funny and thats the sort of thing to hunt for hunting in london besides is amusing in itself he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i dont mean a comic toy i mean some little thing with a charm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness thats what i call funny she had explained you used she had also added to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendid for beating down i have them all still i neednt say the little bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london in august ah but i dont understand your english buying and i confess i find it dull so much as that while they turned to go up together he had objected i understood my poor dear romans it was they who understood you that was your pull she had laughed our amusement here is just that they dont understand us we can make it amusing youll see if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present certainly as i say well if they dont come down then well come up theres always something to be done besides prince she had gone on im not if you come to that absolutely a pauper im too poor for some things she had said yet strange as she was lightly enough but im not too poor for others and she had paused again at the top ive been saving up he had really challenged it in america yes even there with my motive and we oughtnt you know she had wound up to leave it beyond tomorrow that definitely with ten words more was what had passed he feeling all the while how any sort of beggingoff would only magnify it he might get on with things as they were but he must do anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful to make her beg of him he was making her she had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didnt at all do that was accordingly in fine how they had come to where they were he was engaged as hard as possible in the policy of not magnifying he had kept this up even on her making a point and as if it were almost the whole point that maggie of course was not to have an idea half the interest of the thing at least would be that she shouldnt suspect therefore he was completely to keep it from her as charlotte on her side would that they had been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen each other for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of their little excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to his kindness to let her feel that he didnt betray her there had been something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appeal at such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was one thing to have met the girl casually at mrs assinghams and another to arrange with her thus for a morning practically as private as their old mornings in rome and practically not less intimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening of the minutes that had passed between them in cadogan place though not mentioning those of mrs assinghams absence any more than he mentioned the fact of what their friend had then with such small delay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to any present to any positive making of mystery what had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enough for her to notice it was the sense of the resemblance of the little plan before him to occasions of the past from which he was quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thing he wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was in its being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would be new altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered so quickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he was in presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them as soon as read them had met them with a do you want then to go and tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had made him promptly fall back on minimizing it that is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had on the spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happy principle that would meet every case this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediate submission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave what she gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tune of her renouncing she really renounced renounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter of their keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchange for everything everything she gave up was verily but a trifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soon assented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn she might wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preference had been well applied to it even while they were still in the park the application in fact presently required that they should sit down a little really to see where they were in obedience to which propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quite distinct in a couple of pennychairs under one of the larger trees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rainfreshened grass after finding it already dry and the chairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and the aspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of green which seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom they helped charlotte thus to make her position her temporary position still more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she sat down he stood for a little before her as if to mark the importance of not wasting time the importance she herself had previously insisted on but after she had said a few words it was impossible for him not to resort again to goodnature he marked as he could by this concession that if he had finally met her first proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea she might have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistency to treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth i dont care what you make of it and i dont ask anything whatever of you anything but this i want to have said it thats all i want not to have failed to say it to see you once and be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be for one small hour or say for two thats what i have had for weeks in my head i mean of course to get it before before what youre going to do so all the while you see she went on with her eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able to manage it in time if i couldnt have come now i probably shouldnt have come at all perhaps even ever now that im here i shall stay but there were moments over there when i despaired it wasnt easy there were reasons but it was either this or nothing so i didnt struggle you see in vain after oh i didnt want that i dont mean she smiled that it wouldnt have been delightful to see you even then to see you at any time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what ive got this is what i shall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you had thought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally have been immensely sold i had to take the risk well youre all i could have hoped thats what i was to have said i didnt want simply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know i wanted you she kept it up slowly softly with a small tremor of voice but without the least failure of sense or sequence i wanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i dont care i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing of you i dont i maynt ask even so much as that what you may think of me that doesnt in the least matter what i want is that it shall always be with you so that youll never be able quite to get rid of it that i did i wont say that you did you may make as little of that as you like but that i was here with you where we are and as we are i just saying this giving myself in other words away and perfectly willing to do it for nothing thats all she paused as if her demonstration was complete yet for the moment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes to sink in into the listening air into the watching space into the conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was all londonised all vulgarised with them there or even for that matter into her own open ears rather than into the attention of her passive and prudent friend his attention had done all that attention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet still more definitely amused face sufficiently played its part he clutched however at what he could best clutch at the fact that she let him off definitely let him off she let him off it seemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiled back at her in return for her information he felt his lips remain closed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again at last you may want to know what i get by it but thats my own affair he really didnt want to know even this or continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didnt which prolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had taken refuge he was glad when finally the point she had wished to make seeming established to her satisfaction they brought to what might pass for a close the moment of his life at which he had had least to say movement and progress after this with more impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was not again during their excursion at a loss for the right word the air had been as it were cleared they had their errand itself to discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of the wonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question of shops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by each in previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of the others knowledge the prince in especial wondered at his friends possession of her london he had rather prized his own possession the guidance he could really often give a cabman it was a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruous with that feature which had after all so much more surface than depth when his companion with the memory of other visits and other rambles spoke of places he hadnt seen and things he didnt know he actually felt again as half the effect just a shade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyed if it hadnt been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curious worldquality of which in rome he had had his due sense but which clearly would show larger on the big london stage rome was in comparison a village a familyparty a little oldworld spinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached the marble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis the right tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands should they disagree a little frankly and fairly about directions and chances values and authenticities the situation would be quite gloriously saved they were none the less as happened much of one mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts with which maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as a matter of course named it in time as a condition they would keep away from any place to which he had already been with maggie this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during the last month done few things so much as attend his future wife on her making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them with charlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed in connection with that order of traffic was full of consequences produced by her fathers mr verver one of the great collectors of the world hadnt left his daughter to prowl for herself he had little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all over europe sought introductions to him high personages incredibly high and more of them than would ever be known solemnly sworn as everyone was in such cases to discretion high personages made up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likely to give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as they walked that the tracks of the ververs daughters as well as fathers were to be avoided the importance only was that their talk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yet exchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to them for it was she who began with a serenity of appreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words of ten minutes before this was another note on her what he would have called another light for her companion who though without giving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of her transition a transition that took no trouble either to trace or to explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass to make it she stopped before him with a sudden anything of course dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to give her a pincushion from the bakerstreet bazaar thats exactly what i meant the prince laughed out this allusion to their snatch of talk in portland place its just what i suggested she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in her own way but it isnt a reason in that case one would never do anything for her i mean charlotte explained if one took advantage of her character of her character we mustnt take advantage of her character the girl again unheeding pursued one mustnt if not for her at least for ones self she saves one such trouble she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friends she might have been talking preoccupied and practical of someone with whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly gives one no trouble said the prince and then as if this were perhaps ambiguous or inadequate shes not selfish god forgive her enough thats what i mean charlotte instantly said shes not selfish enough theres nothing absolutely that one need do for her shes so modest she developed she doesnt miss things i mean if you love her or rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go the prince frowned a little as a tribute after all to seriousness she lets what anything anything that you might do and that you dont she lets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you its of herself that she asks efforts so far as she ever has to ask them she hasnt much she does everything herself and thats terrible the prince had listened but always with propriety he didnt commit himself terrible well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easy terms for one it takes stuff within one so far as ones decency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlotte continued in the same manner is decent enough good enough to stand it not without help from religion or something of that kind not without prayer and fasting that is without taking great care certainly she said such people as you and i are not the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough to stand it well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happen each i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh i dont know may not ones affection for her do something more for ones decency as you call it than her own generosity her own affection her decency has the unfortunate virtue to undo ah of course it must be all in that but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes to one can see what you mean is the way she believes in one that is if she believes at all yes thats what it comes to said charlotte stant and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldnt at the worst see that because its always so the idea of having to pity people not when theres also with it the idea of helping them yes but if we cant help them we can we always can that is he competently added if we care for them and thats what were talking about yes she on the whole assented it comes back then to our absolutely refusing to be spoiled certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i mean comes back to that she walked beside him a moment its just what i meant she then reasonably said vi the man in the little shop in which well after this they lingered longest the small but interesting dealer in the bloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence not importunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercive this personage fixed on his visitors an extraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other while they considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hope to tempt them they had come to him last for their time was nearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of their getting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded no better result than the amusement invoked from the first the amusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but it had also involved the idea of finding which latter necessity would have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon the question at present was if they were finding and they put it to each other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed the undiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his business the essence of which in his conception might precisely have been this particular secret that he possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairly made for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not many things none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a muster so scant that as high values obviously wouldnt reign the effect might be almost pitiful then their impression had changed for though the show was of small pieces several taken from the little window and others extracted from a cupboard behind the counter dusky in the rather lowbrowed place despite its glass doors each bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of their entertainers pretensions was promptly enough given his array was heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differed agreeably from what they had hitherto seen charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions of several of which later on she gave her companion always in the interest of their amusement the benefit and one of the impressions had been that the man himself was the greatest curiosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to this that he himself hadnt looked at him as precisely in the general connection charlotte had more than once from other days noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below a certain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was just like another to him which was oddly inconsequent on the part of a mind that where it did notice noticed so much he took throughout always the meaner sort for granted the night of their meanness or whatever name one might give it for him made all his cats grey he didnt no doubt want to hurt them but he imaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level of his own high head her own vision acted for every relation this he had seen for himself she remarked beggars she remembered servants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguished beauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on this occasion she had found their antiquario interesting partly because he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his things he loves them she was to say and it isnt only it isnt perhaps even at all that he loves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if he could and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right people he knows them when he sees them and thats why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didnt you see she was to ask it with an insistence the way he looked at us and took us in i doubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes hell remember us she was to profess herself convinced of that almost to uneasiness but it was after all this was perhaps reassuring because given his taste since he has taste he was pleased with us he was struck he had ideas about us well i should think people might were beautiful arent we and he knows then also he has his way for that way of saying nothing with his lips when hes all the while pressing you so with his face which shows how he knows you feel it that is a regular way of decent old gold old silver old bronze of old chased and jewelled artistry were the objects that successively produced had ended by numerously dotting the counter where the shopmans slim light fingers with neat nails touched them at moments briefly nervously tenderly as those of a chessplayer rest a few seconds over the board on a figure he thinks he may move and then may not small florid ancientries ornaments pendants lockets brooches buckles pretexts for dim brilliants bloodless rubies pearls either too large or too opaque for value miniatures mounted with diamonds that had ceased to dazzle snuffboxes presented to or by the tooquestionable great cups trays taperstands suggestive of pawntickets archaic and brown that would themselves if preserved have been prized curiosities a few commemorative medals of neat outline but dull reference a classic monument or two things of the first years of the century things consular napoleonic temples obelisks arches tinily reembodied completed the discreet cluster in which however even after tentative reinforcement from several quaint rings intaglios amethysts carbuncles each of which had found a home in the ancient sallow satin of some weaklysnapping little box there was in spite of the due proportion of faint poetry no great force of persuasion they looked the visitors they touched they vaguely pretended to consider but with scepticism so far as courtesy permitted in the quality of their attention it was impossible they shouldnt after a little tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying to maggie a token from such a stock it would be that was the difficulty pretentious without being good too usual as a treasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet too primitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they had been out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to take its little value from having belonged to ones self ecco said the prince just triumphantly enough there you are behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two or three of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyes found themselves resting on those he had not visited but she completed her admission theres nothing here she could wear it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is there anything do you think that you could it made her just start she didnt at all events look at the objects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no ah the prince quietly exclaimed would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer me something well why not as a small ricordo but a ricordo of what why of this as you yourself say of this little hunt oh i say it but hasnt my whole point been that i dont ask you to therefore she demanded but smiling at him now wheres the logic oh the logic he laughed but logics everything that at least is how i feel it a ricordo from you from you to me is a ricordo of nothing it has no reference ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with her friend than in anything else again met his gaze it was a comfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had one of the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase you dont refer she went on to her companion i refer he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into it hard do you mean by that then that you would be free free to offer me something this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she might have seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allow me no said the prince into his little box you wouldnt accept it from me no he repeated in the same way she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh but youve touched an idea that has been mine its what ive wanted then she added it was what i hoped he put down his box this had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little mans attention its what you brought me out for well thats at any rate she returned my own affair but it wont do it wont do cara mia its impossible its impossible and he took up one of the brooches she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i were to accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest what should i do with it he was perhaps at last a little irritated he even as if he might understand looked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco where then please under my clothes wherever you like but it isnt then if you will he added worth talking about its only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from your having begun it my question is only reasonable so that your idea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin one of these things on for you would it be to your mind that i might go home and show it to maggie as your present they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as a pleasantry in the other time his explanation to her of everything but nothing truly had even seemed so oldroman as the shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not because on our basis it would be impossible to give her an account of the pretext the pretext he wondered the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together and that were not to speak of oh yes he said after a moment i remember were not to speak of it that of course youre pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you dont insist he had again at random laid back his trinket with which he quite turned to her a little wearily at last even a little impatiently i dont insist it disposed for the time of the question but what was next apparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman who had not stirred stood there in his patience which his mute intensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute looked though not less patiently into the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence youve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too much and it made the prince face about for the effect of the momentous came if not from the sense from the sound of his words which was that of the suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with her friend a glance that matched it and just for the minute they were held in check but their glance had after all by that time said more than one thing had both exclaimed on the apprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation let alone of her possible her impossible title and remarked for mutual reassurance that it didnt all the same matter the prince remained by the door but immediately addressing the speaker from where he stood youre italian then are you but the reply came in english oh dear no youre english to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefest italian che the dealer waived the question he practically disposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle to which he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with wornlooking leather he placed the box on the counter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid and removed from its nest a drinkingvessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either of old fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled it with tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a small satin mat my golden bowl he observed and it sounded on his lips as if it said everything he left the important object for as important it did somehow present itself to produce its certain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on a circular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charm of its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might have been a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happy curve by half its original height as formed of solid gold it was impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded it from a distance it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion he hesitated look a little and perhaps youll make out she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it to the light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear im afraid for me well said the man i can part with it for less than its value i got it you see for less for how much then again he waited always with his serene stare do you like it then charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came no nearer he looked at their companion cose well signori miei if you must know its just a perfect crystal of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turned away again he went back to his glass door charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do you mean its cut out of a single crystal if it isnt i think i can promise you that youll never find any joint or any piecing she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold he showed though with due respect that she amused him you couldnt scrape it off it has been too well put on put on i dont know when and i dont know how but by some very fine old worker and by some beautiful old process charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art call it a lost art but of what time then is the whole thing well say also of a lost time the girl considered then if its so precious how comes it to be cheap her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the prince had lost patience ill wait for you out in the air he said to his companion and though he spoke without irritation he pointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to the shopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a fresh cigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was aware of his funny italian taste for london streetlife her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah ive had it a long time without selling it i think i must have been keeping it madam for you youve kept it for me because youve thought i mightnt see whats the matter with it he only continued to face her he only continued to appear to follow the play of her mind what is the matter with it oh its not for me to say its for you honestly to tell me of course i know something must be but if its something you cant find out isnt it as good as if it were nothing i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it not her host lucidly insisted if you hadnt paid too much what do you call she asked little enough well what should you say to fifteen pounds i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude that its altogether too much the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly its my price madam and if you admire the thing i think it really might be yours its not too much its too little its almost nothing i cant go lower charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then its impossible its more than i can afford ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a present more than one can afford for ones self he said it so coaxingly that she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for a present then it would be a lovely one does one make a present she asked of an object that contains to ones knowledge a flaw well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the good faith the man smiled is always there and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean to discover it he wouldnt discover it if youre speaking of a gentleman im not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said well whoever it might be he might know and he might try but he wouldnt find she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing should come to pieces and then as he was silent not even if he should have to say to me the golden bowl is broken he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it she laughed she almost admired the little mans expression you mean one could smash it with a hammer yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing it with violence say upon a marble floor oh marble floors but she might have been thinking for they were a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of the ververs all the same however there were other things and they all together held for a moment her fancy does crystal then break when it is crystal i thought its beauty was its hardness her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its being crystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesnt break he went on like vile glass it splits if there is a split ah charlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh on lines and by laws of its own you mean if theres a weak place for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with the finest sweetest sound where is the weak place she then did the question justice well for me only the price im poor you see very poor but i thank you and ill think the prince on the other side of the shopwindow had finally faced about and as to see if she hadnt done was trying to reach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i like it she said i want it but i must decide what i can do the man not ungraciously resigned himself well ill keep it for you the small quarterofanhour had had its marked oddity this she felt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects had again in their protest against the truth of her gathered impression made her more or less their own yet the oddity might have been registered as small as compared to the other effect that before they had gone much further she had with her companion to take account of this latter was simply the effect of their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didnt say so but it was on the line of giving up maggies present that they practically proceeded the line of giving it up without more reference to it the princes first reference was in fact quite independently made i hope you satisfied yourself before you had done of what was the matter with that bowl no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at least but that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that if you werent so unaccommodating this would be just the occasion for your giving me the pleasure of accepting it he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all the morning do you propose it seriously without wishing to play me a trick she wondered what trick would it be he looked at her harder you mean you really dont know but know what why whats the matter with it you didnt see all the while she only continued however to stare how could you see out in the street i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didnt want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate she waited but a moment five pounds really so little five pounds he continued to look at her five pounds he might have been doubting her word but he was only it appeared gathering emphasis it would be dear to make a gift of at five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence i wouldnt take it from you then she asked what is the matter why it has a crack it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority that she almost started while her colour at the word rose it was as if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful you answer for it without having looked i did look i saw the object itself it told its story no wonder its cheap but its exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it now made even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist of course its exquisite thats the danger then a light visibly came to her a light in which her friend suddenly and intensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him was in her own face the danger i see is because youre superstitious per dio im superstitious a crack is a crack and an omens an omen youd be afraid per bacco for your happiness for my happiness for your safety for my safety she just paused for your marriage for my marriage for everything she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crack we know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that we dont know and she smiled with the sadness of it we can never then give each other anything he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do at least and by instinct i dont fail that will always protect me it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general or rather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair what then will protect me where im concerned i will from me at least youve nothing to fear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent to accept from me but he paused well well shall be perfect thats very fine she presently answered its vain after all for you to talk of my accepting things when youll accept nothing from me ah there better still he could meet her you attach an impossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so to myself well she looked before him there at the condition then abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake of disenchantment so far as the idea had appealed to her it all appeared too difficult oh my condition i dont hold to it you may cry it on the housetops anything i ever do ah well then this made he laughed all the difference but it was too late oh i dont care now i should have liked the bowl but if that wont do theres nothing he considered this he took it in looking graver again but after a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to give you something she wondered at him what day the day you marry for you will marry you must seriously marry she took it from him but it determined in her the only words she was to have uttered all the morning that came out as if a spring had been pressed to make you feel better well he replied frankly wonderfully it will but here he added is your hansom he had signalled the cab was charging she put out no hand for their separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in all freedom part second vii adam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have been observed to open the door of the billiardroom with a certain freedom might have been observed that is had there been a spectator in the field the justification of the push he had applied however and of the push equally sharp that to shut himself in he again applied the ground of this energy was precisely that he might here however briefly find himself alone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and other unopened missives to which during and since breakfast he had lacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square clean apartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out into spaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shining artificial lake of richlycondensed horizon all dark blue upland and churchtowered village and strong cloudshadow which were together a thing to create the sense with everyone else at church of ones having the world to ones self we share this world none the less for the hour with mr verver the very fact of his striking as he would have said for solitude the fact of his quiet flight almost on tiptoe through tortuous corridors investing him with an interest that makes our attention tender indeed almost to compassion qualify his achieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that this amiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage in general only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim it may be mentioned also that he always figured other persons such was the law of his nature as a numerous array and that though conscious of but a single near tie one affection one duty deepestrooted in his life it had never for many minutes together been his portion not to feel himself surrounded and committed never quite been his refreshment to make out where the manycoloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity really faded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his vision sometimes ached it shaded off the appeal he would have admitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which it positively stopped thus had grown in him a little habit his innermost secret not confided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as she understood to his view everything thus had shaped itself the innocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had no conscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty did reign for an hour a small game to which the few persons near enough to have caught him playing it and of whom mrs assingham for instance was one attached indulgently that idea of quaintness quite in fact that charm of the pathetic involved in the preservation by an adult of one of childhoods toys when he took a rare moment off he did so with the touching confessing eyes of a man of fortyseven caught in the act of handling a relic of infancy sticking on the head of a broken soldier or trying the lock of a wooden gun it was essentially in him the imitation of depravity which for amusement as might have been he practised keeping up in spite of practice he was still imperfect for these so artlesslyartful interludes were condemned by the nature of the case to brevity he had fatally stamped himself it was his own fault a man who could be interrupted with impunity the greatest of wonders moreover was exactly in this that so interrupted a man should ever have got as the phrase was should above all have got so early to where he was it argued a special genius he was clearly a case of that the spark of fire the point of light sat somewhere in his inward vagueness as a lamp before a shrine twinkles in the dark perspective of a church and while youth and early middleage while the stiff american breeze of example and opportunity were blowing upon it hard had made of the chamber of his brain a strange workshop of fortune this establishment mysterious and almost anonymous the windows of which at hours of highest pressure never seemed for starers and wonderers perceptibly to glow must in fact have been during certain years the scene of an unprecedented a miraculous whiteheat the receipt for producing which it was practically felt that the master of the forge could not have communicated even with the best intentions the essential pulse of the flame the very action of the cerebral temperature brought to the highest point yet extraordinarily contained these facts themselves were the immensity of the result they were one with perfection of machinery they had constituted the kind of acquisitive power engendered and applied the necessary triumph of all operations a dim explanation of phenomena once vivid must at all events for the moment suffice us it being obviously no account of the matter to throw on our friends amiability alone the weight of the demonstration of his economic history amiability of a truth is an aid to success it has even been known to be the principle of large accumulations but the link for the mind is none the less fatally missing between proof on such a scale of continuity if of nothing more insolent in one field and accessibility to distraction in every other variety of imagination what is that but fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as not to be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud the cloud was his native envelope the soft looseness so to say of his temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt to figure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable for sensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting his rare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his real inability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps not often been better instanced than by his acceptance of the inevitable today his acceptance of it on the arrival at the end of a quarterofan hour of that element of obligation with which he had all the while known he must reckon a quarterofanhour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation with another usually got mrs rance opened the door more tentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on the other hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward even more briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeing nobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her at least that justice it was a kind of justice he was always doing someone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home and he had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to make this possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do the same the trick was so easily played it had not occurred to him to plan in any way for her absence which would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence if persons under his roof hadnt a right not to go to church what became for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvre had been simply to change from the library to the billiardroom it being in the library that his guest or his daughters or the guest of the miss lutches he scarce knew in which light to regard her had then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visit she had that time as it were paid him that the law of recurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spent the whole morning with him was still there in the library when the others came back thanks to her having been tepid about their taking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if she looked on that as a kind of subterfuge almost as a form of disloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish to make of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much as a stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearningly invited so that one positively had her possible susceptibilities the more on ones conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends of maggies friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appeared only as a friend of the miss lutches this lady herself was not of the middle west she rather insisted on it but of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of the smallest and most intimate states he couldnt remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in him we may say it for him to go so far as to wonder if their group were next to be recruited by some friend of her own and this partly because she had struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutches themselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly as well as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyed with the ironic question in general resided substantially less in a personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy to others he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep his inconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed if the sum of these latter had at the most always been small that was doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of the former his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted had he analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as he had money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of ones power whereas ones own need at the best would have seemed to be but some trick for not communicating it the effect of a reserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as an infinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a brave man might complain complaint besides was a luxury and he dreaded the imputation of greed the other the constant imputation that of being able to do would have no ground if he hadnt been to start with this was the point provably luxurious his lips somehow were closed and by a spring connected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves the latter showed him what he had done showed him where he had come out quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharp spiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age of twenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if one would on the kingdoms of the earth and with standingroom for but halfadozen others his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with an instant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity of mrs rances own or at least to descry any triumphant use even for the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtually supreme would be her vision of his having attempted by his desertion of the library to mislead her which in point of fact barely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy for him in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as of systematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thing comparatively easy would be to gloss over his course the billiardroom was not at the particular crisis either a natural or a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large a house to retire to and this without prejudice either to the fact that his visitor wouldnt as he apprehended explicitly make him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak he would simply go to pieces but he was after an instant not afraid of that wouldnt she rather as emphasising their communion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat it perhaps as romantic or possibly even as comic show at least that they neednt mind even though the vast table draped in brown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desert sand she couldnt cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into an obstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childish game or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on no account take and there loomed before him for the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock about the balls that danger certainly it struck him he should manage in some way to deal with why too for that matter had he need of defences material or other how was it a question of dangers really to be called such the deep danger the only one that made him as an idea positively turn cold would have been the possibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing up between them that terrible issue here fortunately she was powerless it being apparently so provable against her that she had a husband in undiminished existence she had him it was true only in america only in texas in nebraska in arizona or somewhere somewhere that at old fawns house in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definite place at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost so indistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheap divorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him in contempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assert itself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the flesh as they had appeared eager to mention though when they were separately questioned their descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rances difficulty and he served therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyone else this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only danger he feared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actually rose before him a symbol of the supreme effort that he should have sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would be to say no he lived in terror of having to he should be proposed to at a given moment it was only a question of time and then he should have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasnt so sure he would do it he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knew coldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw the line it was maggies marriage and maggies finer happiness happy as he had supposed her before that had made the difference he hadnt in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadnt come up for him and it was as if she positively had herself kept them down she had only been his child which she was indeed as much as ever but there were sides on which she had protected him as if she were more than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did at present more than ever through having what she called the change in his life to make up to him for his situation still all the same kept pace with her activity his situation being simply that there was more than ever to be done there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing as since their return from their twenty months in america as since their settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of a domestic air that had cleared and lightened producing the effect for their common personal life of wider perspectives and large waiting spaces it was as if his soninlaws presence even from before his becoming his soninlaw had somehow filled the scene and blocked the future very richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not to have been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure now practically taken was still pretty much the same big fact the sky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itself expanded quite to match him quite to keep everything in comfortable scale at first certainly their decent little oldtime union maggies and his own had resembled a good deal some pleasant public square in the heart of an old city into which a great palladian church say something with a grand architectural front had suddenly been dropped so that the rest of the place the space in front the way round outside to the east end the margin of street and passage the quantity of overarching heaven had been temporarily compromised not even then of a truth in a manner disconcerting given that is for the critical or at least the intelligent eye the great style of the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenon that had since occurred whether originally to have been pronounced calculable or not had not naturally been the miracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with its eighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculous no visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladian church was always there but the piazza took care of itself the sun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and the public not less the limit stood off the way round was easy the east end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there were also side doors for entrance between the two large monumental ornamental in their style as for all proper great churches by some such process in fine had the prince for his fatherinlaw while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at all ominously a block mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no moment sufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of his reassurance but he would none the less not have been unable not really have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the right person his notion of the history of the matter the right person it is equally distinct had not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fanny assingham not for the first time indeed admitted to his counsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeated his secret it all came then the great clearance from the one prime fact that the prince by good fortune hadnt proved angular he clung to that description of his daughters husband as he often did to terms and phrases in the human the social connection that he had found for himself it was his way to have times of using these constantly as if they just then lighted the world or his own path in it for him even when for some of his interlocutors they covered less ground it was true that with mrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anything covered she disputed with him so little agreed with him so much surrounded him with such systematic consideration such predetermined tenderness that it was almost which he had once told her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby he had accused her of not taking him seriously and she had replied as from her it couldnt frighten him that she took him religiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughed before on his producing for her that good right word about the happy issue of his connection with the prince with an effect the more odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldnt of course however be at the best as much in love with his discovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairly worked it to his own comfort came in fact sometimes near publicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred if friction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly one day to the personage in question mentioned to the prince the particular justice he did him was even explicit as to the danger that in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angular who could say what might then have happened he spoke and it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham too as if he grasped the facts without exception for which angularity stood it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of the last vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grand right geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he was insensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces youre round my boy he had said youre all youre variously and inexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances have been abominably square im not sure for that matter he had added that youre not square in the general mass whether abominably or not the abomination isnt a question for youre inveterately round thats what i mean in the detail its the sort of thing in you that one feels or at least i do with ones hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the ducal palace in venice so lovely in a building but so damnable for rubbing against in a man and especially in a near relation i can see them all from here each of them sticking out by itself all the architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched ones softer sides one would have been scratched by diamonds doubtless the neatest way if one was to be scratched at all but one would have been more or less reduced to a hash as it is for living with youre a pure and perfect crystal i give you my idea i think you ought to have it just as it has come to me the prince had taken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by this time to taking and nothing perhaps even could more have confirmed mr ververs account of his surface than the manner in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it they caught in no interstice they gathered in no concavity the uniform smoothness betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone the young man in other words unconfusedly smiled though indeed as if assenting from principle and habit to more than he understood he liked all signs that things were well but he cared rather less why they were in regard to the people among whom he had since his marriage been living the reasons they so frequently gave so much oftener than he had ever heard reasons given before remained on the whole the element by which he most differed from them and his fatherinlaw and his wife were after all only first among the people among whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they felt remarkably so often things he hadnt meant and missed not less remarkably and not less often things he had he had fallen back on his general explanation we havent the same values by which he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in his relegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantities too for granted one was no more surprised at the resulting feasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at being upstairs in a house that had a staircase he had in fact on this occasion disposed alertly enough of the subject of mr ververs approbation the promptitude of his answer we may in fact well surmise had sprung not a little from a particular kindled remembrance this had given his acknowledgment its easiest turn oh if im a crystal im delighted that im a perfect one for i believe that they sometimes have cracks and flaws in which case theyre to be had very cheap he had stopped short of the emphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had been certainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of the good taste practically reigning between them that mr verver had not on his side either taken up the opportunity it is the latters relation to such aspects however that now most concerns us and the bearing of his pleased view of this absence of friction upon amerigos character as a representative precious object representative precious objects great ancient pictures and other works of art fine eminent pieces in gold in silver in enamel majolica ivory bronze had for a number of years so multiplied themselves round him and as a general challenge to acquisition and appreciation so engaged all the faculties of his mind that the instinct the particular sharpened appetite of the collector had fairly served as a basis for his acceptance of the princes suit over and above the signal fact of the impression made on maggie herself the aspirant to his daughters hand showed somehow the great marks and signs stood before him with the high authenticities he had learned to look for in pieces of the first order adam verver knew by this time knew thoroughly no man in europe or in america he privately believed was less capable in such estimates of vulgar mistakes he had never spoken of himself as infallible it was not his way but apart from the natural affections he had acquainted himself with no greater joy of the intimately personal type than the joy of his originally coming to feel and all so unexpectedly that he had in him the spirit of the connoisseur he had like many other persons in the course of his reading been struck with keatss sonnet about stout cortez in the presence of the pacific but few persons probably had so devoutly fitted the poets grand image to a fact of experience it consorted so with mr ververs consciousness of the way in which at a given moment he had stared at his pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortal lines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory his peak in darien was the sudden hour that had transformed his life the hour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the low moan of apprehensive passion that a world was left him to conquer and that he might conquer it if he tried it had been a turning of the page of the book of life as if a leaf long inert had moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stir of the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the golden isles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become the business of his future and with the sweetness of it what was most wondrous of all still more even in the thought than in the act the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at least of taste with something in himself with the dormant intelligence of which he had thus almost violently become aware and that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of the screw his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow with the great seers the invokers and encouragers of beauty and he didnt after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producers and creators he had been nothing of that kind beforetoo decidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had been what he had why he had failed and fallen short even in huge success now he read into his career in one single magnificent night the immense meaning it had waited for it was during his first visit to europe after the death of his wife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in his mind had so broken and he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it had still been closely covered he had bought then so far as he had been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakers and jewellers her flutter pale disconcerted ghost as she actually was a broken white flower tied round almost grotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of the boulevard her flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frills and fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory of the bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confronted with opportunity he could wince fairly still as he remembered the sense in which the poor girls pressure had under his fond encouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase and curiosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote than he liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism that maggies mother all too strangely had not so much failed of faith as of the right application of it since she had exercised it eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocent perversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last to reduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other so that his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarily paid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities of decoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little man that he was and addicted to silent pleasures as he was accessible to silent pains he even sometimes wondered what would have become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was to learn more and more exclusively to play if his wifes influence upon it had not been in the strange scheme of things so promptly removed would she have led him altogether attached as he was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would she have prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peak or would she otherwise have been able to accompany him to that eminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez to his companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortez had presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historic fact to determine his inference viii what was at all events not permanently hidden from him was a truth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was the strange scheme of things again the years of darkness had been needed to render possible the years of light a wiser hand than he at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort as a perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and the preliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith of it had been less his comparative blindness had made the good faith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for the flower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging and sweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just as he had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginative gambling all for themselves the creation of interests that were the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of course been so far from really the case with the supreme idea all the while growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and worked where it was buried and the fact itself the fact of his fortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharp tender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side was the ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age might still be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he had wrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and what would ever have been straighter in any mans life than his way now of occupying it it hadnt merely his plan all the sanctions of civilization it was positively civilization condensed concrete consummate set down by his hands as a house on a rock a house from whose open doors and windows open to grateful to thirsty millions the higher the highest knowledge would shine out to bless the land in this house designed as a gift primarily to the people of his adoptive city and native state the urgency of whose release from the bondage of ugliness he was in a position to measure in this museum of museums a palace of art which was to show for compact as a greek temple was compact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit today almost altogether lived making up as he would have said for lost time and haunting the portico in anticipation of the final rites these would be the opening exercises the august dedication of the place his imagination he was well aware got over the ground faster than his judgment there was much still to do for the production of his first effect foundations were laid and walls were rising the structure of the shell all determined but raw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with the highest effects of patience and piety he should belie himself by completing without a touch at least of the majesty of delay a monument to the religion he wished to propagate the exemplary passion the passion for perfection at any price he was far from knowing as yet where he would end but he was admirably definite as to where he wouldnt begin he wouldnt begin with a small show he would begin with a great and he could scarce have indicated even had he wished to try the line of division he had drawn he had taken no trouble to indicate it to his fellowcitizens purveyors and consumers in his own and the circumjacent commonwealths of comic matter in large lettering diurnally set up printed published folded and delivered at the expense of his presumptuous emulation of the snail the snail had become for him under this ironic suggestion the loveliest beast in nature and his return to england of which we are present witnesses had not been unconnected with the appreciation so determined it marked what he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth a couple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changes and chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particular shade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe it didnt look like much for a whole family to hang about waitingthey being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world he felt on which the question of appearance would ever really again count for him he cared that a work of art of price should look like the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfully attributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter of the rest of life by its looks he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he was not actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieces he had handled nothing so precious as the principino his daughters firstborn whose italian designation endlessly amused him and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost toss and catch again as he couldnt a correspondingly rare morsel of an earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching child from his nurses arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of high cabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none of his silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity had ever been so legitimately straight as the mere element of attitude reduce it he said to that in his easy weeks at fawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spite of the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had really something for him that she was keeping back in spite of his full consciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generously poured that if he had consented to marry his daughter and thereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded him now was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated the difference in fine definitely made he could call back his prior his own wedded consciousness it was not yet out of range of vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he had supposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet he wondered if their state had deserved the name or their union worn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before him carried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy in new york the grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issue the happy pair struck him as having carried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concern his imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mute wonderment it characterised above all with its subject before it his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at the end of the years of whether maggies mother had after all been capable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meant as the terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the fact of being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself at this season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such was the impression that positively holding off a little for the practical the tactful consideration it inspired in him a respect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was her mother oh yes but her mother and something more it becoming thus a new light for him and in such a curious way too that anything more than her mother should prove at this time of day possible he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the long process of his introduction to his present interests an introduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials or picks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speaking to a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him in relation he had knocked at the door of that essentially private house and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last got in it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidence only with time but when he had taken real possession of the place it had been never again to come away all of which success represented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would have been pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and his difficulty thanks to his modesty had been to believe in his facility this was the problem he had worked out to its solution the solution that was now doing more than all else to make his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished to feel good as they said at american city he had but to retrace his immense development that was what the whole thing came back to that the development had not been somebodys else passing falsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile he might have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finest spring that ever responded to his touch was always there to press the memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like a sunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided between florence rome and naples some three years after his wifes death it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation in particular that he could usually best recover with the way that there above all where the princes and popes had been before him his divination of his faculty most went to his head he was a plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but no pope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning he believed into the character of the patron of art he was ashamed of them really if he wasnt afraid and he had on the whole never so climbed to the tiptop as in judging over a perusal of hermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by their treatment of michael angelo far below the plain american citizen in the case at least in which this personage happened not to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friends head moreover some of the results of such comparisons may doubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom to see of which the comparisons were part what could it do but steadily grow and grow it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very time of mrs rances conspiring against him at fawns with the billiardroom and the sunday morning on the occasion round which we have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at least controlled practically each other license of the present and the near future the license to pass the hour as he would have found convenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed to and not only by this aspirant but by any other he wouldnt prove foolish the proof of wisdom was none the less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned the license in especial to proceed from his letters to his journals and insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over his gained interval of the manymouthed monster the exercise of whose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained with him till the others came back from church and it was by that time clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impression this was the point took somehow the form not so much of her wanting to press home her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his own special deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whom applications could be referred the applications the contingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentially bristling were not of a sort really to be met by ones self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good as said im restrained you see because of mr rance and also because im proud and refined but if it wasnt for mr rance and for my refinement and my pride the possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill the future a rustle of petticoats of scented manypaged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might from each other it mattered little in what part of the resounding country they had learned to make themselves prevail the assinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through the park to the little old church on the property that our friend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one of his exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband not inveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage the somewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though it happened to be of the faith her own as it had been her mothers and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for his without the solid ease of which making the stage firm and smooth the drama of her marriage might not have been acted out what at last appeared to have happened however was that the divided parties coming back at the same moment had met outside and then drifted together from empty room to room yet not in mere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left at home the quest had carried them to the door of the billiardroom and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a new and sharp perception it was really remarkable this perception expanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughters eyes the look with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred in her absence mrs rances pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of his acceptance of the complication the seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggies anxieties the anxiety it was true would have been even though not imparted separately shared for fanny assinghams face was by the same stroke not at all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colour quite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of the miss lutches each of these persons counting out that is the prince and the colonel who didnt care and who didnt even see that the others did knew something or had at any rate had her idea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade of apprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed have suggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it was droll in truth if one came to that the position of the miss lutches they had themselves brought they had guilelessly introduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rances having been literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowers since mrs rance was a handful had been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputation in the intensity of which really his own propriety might have been involved that none the less was but a flicker what made the real difference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughters anxiety alone had depths and it opened out for him the wider that it was altogether new when in their common past when till this moment had she shown a fear however dumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had been for what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a question that concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of it somehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in a manner on her hands as a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in her life too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted or opposed in short objectively presented but time finally had done it their relation was altered he saw again the difference lighted for her this marked it to himself and it wasnt a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitor had from being an inconvenience become a sign they had made vacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personal precinct they being the princess and the prince they had made room in it for others so others had become aware he became aware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stood there before speaking and with the sense moreover of what he saw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last it may be added would have been his intensest perception had there not the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham her face couldnt keep it from him she had seen on top of everything in her quick way what they both were seeing ix so much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into the scene prematurely a critical character that took longer to develop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon by the father and the daughter did really little else than deal with the elements definitely presented to each in the vibration produced by the return of the churchgoers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before or immediately after luncheon except indeed so far as their failure soon again to meet might be itself an accident charged with reference the hour or two after luncheon and on sundays with especial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which it belonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take account were habitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whose apartment she either frequently found her father already established or was sooner or later joined by him his visit to his grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting his grandsons visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed and the odd bits as he called them that they picked up together when they could communions snatched for the most part on the terrace in the gardens or the park while the principino with much pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine lace overveiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great house the larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easily accessible than if the place had been a royal palace and the small child an heirapparent in the nursery of nurseries the talk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly with or about the master of the scene that other interests and other topics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequate notice there taken of them they came in at the best but as involved in the little boys future his past or his comprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to plead their own merits or to complain of being neglected nothing perhaps in truth had done more than this united participation to confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not only uninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam ververs behalf we have made some mention it was of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautiful baby could take its place as a new link between a wife and a husband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and a grandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of this process might have become by an untoward stroke a hapless halforphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bare and open to the next nearest sympathy they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk of what the prince might be or might do for his son the sum of service in his absence so completely filled itself out it was not in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for he was conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child in the frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet in respect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is for maggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to her husband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to her father of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had all round in this connection his own serenity he was sure of his soninlaws auxiliary admiration admiration he meant of his grandson since to begin with what else had been at work but the instinct or it might fairly have been the tradition of the latters making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to be admired what contributed most to harmony in this play of relations however was the way the young man seemed to leave it to be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapas own was not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition or whatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princess herself well amerigos very discretions were his way of taking account of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct an impression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as he received from this impunity of appropriation these unchallenged nursery hours it was as if the grandpapas special show of the character were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personage knew to his own previous perception that of the princes inability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to be demonstrated on which however he admirably accepted it this last was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horse wouldnt shy at a brassband in a country road because it didnt shy at a tractionengine it might have been brought up to tractionengines without having been brought up to brassbands little by little thus from month to month the prince was learning what his wifes father had been brought up to and now it could be checked off he had been brought up to the romantic view of principini who would have thought it and where would it all stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was a certain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt that the evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on the positive side he didnt know he was learning and it was funny for him to how many things he had been brought up if the prince could only strike something to which he hadnt this wouldnt it seemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest what was now clear at all events for the father and the daughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time to be together at any cost as it were and their necessity so worked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarter hidden from that in which their friends were gathered and cause them to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formal things high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall that had turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a door in the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it but in the old multiplied lettering and then had before them a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all the greenness through which they gradually passed to where some of the grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would find one of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and the ground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distance sufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made a splash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie coming down to go out had brought a parasol which as over her charming bare head she now handled it gave with the big straw hat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tipped back definite intention to their walk they knew the bench it was sequestered they had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there they could have smiled if they hadnt been really too serious and if the question hadnt so soon ceased to matter over the probable wonder of the others as to what would have become of them the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to any judgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speak but for the way that as a rule they almost equally had others on their mind they each knew that both were full of the superstition of not hurting but might precisely have been asking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of their conscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance the attendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five persons among them the very pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announced and now brought from the couple of other houses near enough one of these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sight and sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the case as they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter to see their reputation for a decent friendliness through any momentary danger might be trusted even to carry off their absence for amerigo for amerigos possible funny italian anxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friends explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more than less dependent on them as his new life since that was his own name for it opened out it was no secret to maggie it was indeed positively a public joke for her that she couldnt explain as mrs assingham did and that the prince liking explanations liking them almost as if he collected them in the manner of bookplates or postagestamps for themselves his requisition of this luxury had to be met he didnt seem to want them as yet for use rather for ornament and amusement innocent amusement of the kind he most fancied and that was so characteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightly indolent lack of more dissipated or even just of more sophisticated tastes however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly and gaily recognised and not least by herself as filling in the intimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholy colonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be within call as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure it naturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the good couple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as under form of protest she was there to keep him quiet it was amerigos own description of her influence and it would only have needed a more visible disposition to unrest in him to make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didnt need a jailor she contended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon this was not an animal to be controlled it was an animal to be at the most educated she admitted accordingly that she was educative which maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasnt so it came round to being true that what she was most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meet in a case in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolically named was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to at any rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his fatherinlaw carried out their own little frugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededly in respect to the members of the circle that were with them there than in respect to the pair they were missing almost for the first time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part of people strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of the ways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was as positively aware that she hadnt yet learned to see him as meeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he look he who with his so nobly handsome face could look such wonderful things in case of being left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder there were subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggie herself had her own odd way which didnt moreover the least irritate him of really liking them in proportion as they could strike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amused himself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but she actually this evening didnt mind he might deal with her chinese as he could maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had they oftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assinghams a word referring precisely to that appetite in amerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasnt that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything in her husband that she mightnt see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude any better description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the right things enabled her to make thus it was at any rate that she was able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressed so lucidly by their common comforter the fact that the prince was saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventual purpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions all the impressions and generalisations he gathered putting them away and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to be loaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off he wanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that was unrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts he had collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his big noise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he was about it was the happy form of this assurance that had remained with maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knew what he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom it was impossible for him to appear anything but respectfully occupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song or even of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive of intimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might at times reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance that the case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard to what he still had left at home of his very own in regard to the main seat of his affection the house in rome the big black palace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and also on the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and the castello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of its mountainslope showing beautifully blue from afar as the head and front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moods over the so longestranged state of these properties not indeed all irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leases and charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities of use all without counting the cloud of mortgages that had from far back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse a shroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at the foot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorative effort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he might with another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightest spots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not to be able to bring himself to face the sacrifices sacrifices resting if definitely anywhere with mr verver necessary for winning them back one of the most comfortable things between the husband and the wife meanwhile one of those easy certitudes they could be merely gay about was that she never admired him so much or so found him heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the very degree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her as when she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp that had then begun once for all to constitute her substance there was really nothing they had talked of together with more intimate and familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege the boundless happy margin thus established for each she going so far as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beat her the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after no matter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that most deeply moved her suffice to bring her round what would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that his course wouldnt then be difficult inasmuch as so simply constituted as he was on all the precious question and why should he be ashamed of it he knew but one way with the fair they had to be fair and he was fastidious and particular his standard was high but when once this was the case what relation with them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness his interest she always answered happened not to be plain and plainness all round had little to do with the matter which was marked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour but the working basis at all events had been settled the miss maddocks of life been assured of their importance for him how conveniently assured maggie to take him too into the joke had more than once gone so far as to mention to her father since it fell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remember she might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rulesfull as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of course couldnt tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself and about their happiness and their union and their deepest depths and there were other things she neednt but there were also those that were both true and amusing both communicable and real and of these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated scheme of conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of the elements while she lingered apart with her companion it involved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions since so ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreading about them of confidence solidly supported might have suggested for persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they werent insolent they werent our pair could reflect they were only blissful and grateful and personally modest not ashamed of knowing with competence when great things were great when good things were good and when safe things were safe and not therefore placed below their fortune by timidity which would have been as bad as being below it by impudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears under our last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feel that they were what they most finally exhaled into the evening air as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind of helplessness in their felicity their rightness the justification of everything something they so felt the pulse of sat there with them but they might have been asking themselves a little blankly to what further use they could put anything so perfect they had created and nursed and established it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned it with comfort but mightnt the moment possibly count for them or count at least for us while we watch them with their fate all before them as the dawn of the discovery that it doesnt always meet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggie have found a word of definite doubt the expression of the fine pang determined in her a few hours before rise after a time to her lips she took so for granted moreover her companions intelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her question could say it all what is it after all that they want to do to you they were for the princess too the hovering forces of which mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smiling back now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know what she meant what she meant when once she had spoken could come out well enough though indeed it was nothing after they had come to the point that could serve as ground for a great defensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little and maggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has really happened is that the proportions for us are altered he accepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark he still failed to challenge her even when she added that it wouldnt so much matter if he hadnt been so terribly young he uttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that she ought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet by that time she was already herself admitting that she should have had to wait long if she waited that is till he was old but there was a way since you are an irresistible youth weve got to face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel therell be others x to talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes therell be others but youll see me through she hesitated do you mean if you give in oh no through my holding out maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect of abruptness why should you hold out forever he gave none the less no start and this as from the habit of taking anything taking everything from her as harmonious but it was quite written upon him too for that matter that holding out wouldnt be so very completely his natural or at any rate his acquired form his appearance would have testified that he might have to do so a long time for a man so greatly beset this appearance that is spoke but little as yet of short remainders and simplified senses and all in spite of his being a small spare slightly stale person deprived of the general prerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgar immediate quantity that he would in the future any more than he had done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was even something in him that made his position on any occasion made his relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the back of the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of affinity with the footlights he would have figured less than anything the stagemanager or the author of the play who most occupy the foreground he might be at the best the financial backer watching his interests from the wing but in rather confessed ignorance of the mysteries of mimicry barely taller than his daughter he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of his greater stoutness he had lost early in life much of his crisp closelycurling hair the fineness of which was repeated in a small neat beard too compact to be called full though worn equally as for a mark where other marks were wanting on lip and cheek and chin his neat colourless face provided with the merely indispensable features suggested immediately for a description that it was clear and in this manner somewhat resembled a small decent room cleanswept and unencumbered with furniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presently be noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtained windows there was something in adam ververs eyes that both admitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities and gave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars deeply and changeably blue though not romantically large they were yet youthfully almost strangely beautiful with their ambiguity of your scarce knowing if they most carried their possessors vision out or most opened themselves to your own whatever you might feel they stamped the place with their importance as the houseagents say so that on one side or the other you were never out of their range were moving about for possible community opportunity the sight of you scarce knew what either before them or behind them if other importances not to extend the question kept themselves down they were in no direction less obtruded than in that of our friends dress adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuary scruple he wore every day of the year whatever the occasion the same little black cut away coat of the fashion of his younger time he wore the same coollooking trousers chequered in black and white the proper harmony with which he inveterately considered was a sprigged blue satin necktie and over his concave little stomach quaintly indifferent to climates and seasons a white duck waistcoat should you really he now asked like me to marry he spoke as if coming from his daughter herself it might be an idea which for that matter he would be ready to carry out should she definitely say so definite however just yet she was not prepared to be though it seemed to come to her with force as she thought that there was a truth in the connection to utter what i feel is that there is somehow something that used to be right and that ive made wrong it used to be right that you hadnt married and that you didnt seem to want to it used also she continued to make out to seem easy for the question not to come up thats what ive made different it does come up it will come up you dont think i can keep it down mr ververs tone was cheerfully pensive well ive given you by my move all the trouble of having to he liked the tenderness of her idea and it made him as she sat near him pass his arm about her i guess i dont feel as if you had moved very far youve only moved next door well she continued i dont feel as if it were fair for me just to have given you a push and left you so if ive made the difference for you i must think of the difference then what darling he indulgently asked do you think thats just what i dont yet know but i must find out we must think together as weve always thought what i mean she went on after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to at least offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one out for you an alternative to what well to your simply missing what youve lost without anything being done about it but what have i lost she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as if she more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say in the market it was as if you couldnt be in the market when you were married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that im married to some one else youre as in consequence married to nobody therefore you may be married to anybody to everybody people dont see why you shouldnt be married to them isnt it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i dont want to be its enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason it has to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be too much of a fight you ask me what youve lost maggie continued to explain the not having to take the trouble and to make the fight thats what youve lost the advantage the happiness of being just as you were because i was just as i was thats what you miss so that you think her father presently said that i had better get married just in order to be as i was before the detached tone of it detached as if innocently to amuse her by showing his desire to accommodate was so far successful as to draw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i dont want you to feel is that if you were to i shouldnt understand i should understand thats all said the princess gently her companion turned it pleasantly over you dont go so far as to wish me to take somebody i dont like ah father she sighed you know how far i go how far i could go but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you may never doubt of my feeling how ive brought you to it youll always know that i know that its my fault you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will be you wholl take the consequences maggie just considered ill leave you all the good ones but ill take the bad well thats handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawing her closer and holding her more tenderly its about all i could expect of you so far as youve wronged me therefore well call it square ill let you know in time if i see a prospect of your having to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soon went on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse youre not ready or not as ready to see me through my resistance ive got to be a regular martyr before youll be inspired she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it you know it wont be a collapse then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall only collapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i dont want to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i do than appears very probable i dont want to have to think i like it in a case when i really shant ive had to do that in some cases he confessed when it has been a question of other things i dont want he wound up to be made to make a mistake ah but its too dreadful she returned that you should even have to fear or just nervously to dream that you may be what does that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that youre truly susceptible well it may show that he defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kind of life were leading now numerous and formidable maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover of which however she passed quickly from the general to the particular do you feel mrs rance to be charming well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell it comes to the same thing i think shed do anything oh well id help you the princess said with decision as against her if thats all you require its too funny she went on before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether im bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developed under this impression that i dont think we lead as regards other people any life at all we dont at any rate it seems to me lead half the life we might and so it seems i think to amerigo so it seems also im sure to fanny assingham mr ververas if from due regard for these persons considered a little what life would they like us to lead oh its not a question i think on which they quite feel together she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say ah yesher reply was prompt but amerigo doesnt mind he doesnt care i mean what we do its for us he considers to see things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks hes magnificent magnificent i mean for taking everything as it is for accepting the social limitations of our life for not missing what we dont give him mr verver attended then if he doesnt miss it his magnificence is easy it is easythats exactly what i think if there were things he did miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then no doubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could be a hero he will be one if its ever necessary but it will be about something better than our dreariness i know the princess declared where hes magnificent and she rested a minute on that she ended however as she had begun were not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to be grander as fanny thinks we can be grander theres nothing to prevent is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired no its for the amusement for whose for fannys own for everyones though i dare say fannys would be a large part she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced for yours in particular say if you go into the question she even bravely followed it up i havent really after all had to think much to see that much more can be done for you than is done mr verver uttered an odd vague sound dont you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much of that and then to explain thats good and its natural but it isnt great we forget that were as free as air well thats great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we dont she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again a little by this time however struck more and more by an intensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want he demanded to do to me and he added as she didnt say youve got something in your mind it had come to him within the minute that from the beginning of their session there she had been keeping something back and that an impression of this had more than once in spite of his general theoretic respect for her present right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceased to be vague in him there had been from the first something in her anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself that it would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure youve got something up your sleeve she had a silence that made him right well when i tell you youll understand its only up my sleeve in the sense of being in a letter i got this morning all day yes it has been in my mind ive been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just now another woman it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of her manner made it in a degree portentous stand one well mind her coming he stared then he laughed it depends on who she is there you see ive at all events been thinking whether youd take this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is youd go so far with her in your notion of having to be kind he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would she go in her notion of it well his daughter returned you know how far in a general way charlotte stant goes charlotte is she coming she writes me practically that shed like to if were so good as to ask her mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had a drop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not maggies face lighted anew but it was now another light it isnt a want of tact to ask her to propose it to you that i should ask her he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness but this had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant after which as with a flush of recognition she took it up it would be too beautiful if you would this clearly had not been her first idea the chance of his words had prompted it do you mean write to her myself yes it would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you that is of course said maggie if you sincerely can he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldnt and indeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughters friend had surely been taken for granted my dear child he returned i dont think im afraid of charlotte well thats just what its lovely to have from you from the moment youre not the least little bit ill immediately invite her but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had not thought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her shes in brittany at a little bathingplace with some people i dont know shes always with people poor dear she rather has to be even when as is sometimes the case theyre people she doesnt immensely like well i guess she likes us said adam verver yes fortunately she likes us and if i wasnt afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added id even mention that youre not the one of our number she likes least why should that spoil it for me oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about it costs you so much to be liked thats why i hesitated to tell you of my letter he stared a moment as if the subject had suddenly grown out of recognition but charlotte on other visits never used to cost me anything no only her keep maggie smiled then i dont think i mind her keep if thats all the princess however it was clear wished to be thoroughly conscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of its being pleasant to have her its because she will make a difference well whats the harm in that if its but a difference for the better ah then there you are and the princess showed in her smile her small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possible difference for the better were not after all so tremendously right as we are i mean were not as satisfied and amused we do see there are ways of being grander but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise make us grander maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but the more to meet it because shes so handsome no father and the princess was almost solemn because shes so great great great in nature in character in spirit great in life so mr verver echoed what has she done in life well she has been brave and bright said maggie that maynt sound like much but she has been so in the face of things that might well have made it too difficult for many other girls she hasnt a creature in the world really that is nearly belonging to her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use of her and distant relations who are so afraid shell make use of them that they seldom let her look at them mr verver was struck and as usual to some purpose if we get her here to improve us dont we too then make use of her it pulled the princess up however but an instant were old old friends we do her good too i should always even at the worst speaking for myself admire her still more than i used her i see that always does good maggie hesitated certainly she knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness shes not afraid not of anything and yet she no more ever takes a liberty with you than if she trembled for her life and then shes interesting which plenty of other people with plenty of other merits never are a bit in which fine flicker of vision the truth widened to the princesss view i myself of course dont take liberties but then i do always by nature tremble for my life thats the way i live oh i say love her father vaguely murmured yes i live in terror she insisted im a small creeping thing youll not persuade me that youre not as good as charlotte stant he still placidly enough remarked i may be as good but im not so great and thats what were talking about she has a great imagination she has in every way a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed her father at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take it from her to believe she has only twopence in the world but that has nothing to do with it or rather indeed she quickly corrected herself it has everything for she doesnt care i never saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life has been harder than anyone knows it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his child had an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a new thing why then havent you told me about her before well havent we always known i should have thought he submitted that we had already pretty well sized her up certainly we long ago quite took her for granted but things change with time and i seem to know that after this interval im going to like her better than ever ive lived more myself im older and one judges better yes im going to see in charlotte said the princess and speaking now as with high and free expectation more than ive ever seen then ill try to do so too she was it came back to mr verver more the one of your friends i thought the best for you his companion however was so launched in her permitted liberty of appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she was lost in the case she made out the vision of the different ways in which charlotte had distinguished herself she would have liked for instance im sure she would have liked extremely to marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried and has not been able it had all mr ververs attention she has tried she has seen cases where she would have liked to but she has not been able well there are more cases in europe in which it doesnt come to girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence when theyre americans well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on all sides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls are american there are more cases in which it comes to the rich than to the poor she looked at him goodhumouredly that may be but im not going to be smothered in my case it ought to make me if i were in danger of being a fool all the nicer to people like charlotte its not hard for me she practically explained not to be ridiculous unless in a very different way i might easily be ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had done a great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing and anyone can see it and see also that its rather strange and yet no one no one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything but quite right thats what it is to have something about you that carries things off mr ververs silence on this could only be a sign that she had caused her story to interest him though the sign when he spoke was perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean by charlottes being great well said maggie its one of her ways but she has many again for a little her father considered and who is it she has tried to marry maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out with effect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered an obstacle im afraid im not sure then how do you know well i dont know and qualifying again she was earnestly emphatic i only make it out for myself but you must make it out about someone in particular she had another pause i dont think i want even for myself to put names and times to pull away any veil ive an idea there has been more than once somebody im not acquainted with and neednt be or want to be in any case its all over and beyond giving her credit for everything its none of my business mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i dont see how you can give credit without knowing the facts cant i give it generally for dignity dignity i mean in misfortune youve got to postulate the misfortune first well said maggie i can do that isnt it always a misfortune to be when youre so fine so wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question and then after a little solicited by another view to let the appeal drop well she mustnt be wasted we wont at least have waste it produced in maggies face another gratitude then dear sir thats all i want and it would apparently have settled their question and ended their talk if her father had not after a little shown the disposition to revert how many times are you supposing that she has tried once more at this and as if she hadnt been couldnt be hated to be in such delicate matters literal she was moved to attenuate oh i dont say she absolutely ever tried he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed what then had she done she has suffered she has done that and the princess added she has loved and she has lost mr verver however still wondered but how many times maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her her father listened yet not challenging only as with a need of some basis on which under these new lights his bounty could be firm but has she told you nothing ah thank goodness no he stared then dont young women tell because you mean its just what theyre supposed to do she looked at him flushed again now with which after another hesitation do young men tell she asked he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young men do then how do i know father what vulgar girls do i see i see he quickly returned but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously have been sharp what happens at least is that where theres a great deal of pride theres a great deal of silence i dont know i admit what i should do if i were lonely and sore for what sorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i dont know even if im proud it seems to me the question has never come up for me oh i guess youre proud mag her father cheerfully interposed i mean i guess youre proud enough well then i hope im humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do you realise father that ive never had the least blow he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i dont well youll realise when i have one she exclaimed with a short laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of a minute before i wouldnt in any case have let her tell me what would have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames are dreadful at least she added catching herself up i suppose they are for what as i say do i know of them i dont want to know she spoke quite with vehemence there are things that are sacred whether theyre joys or pains but one can always for safety be kind she kept on one feels when thats right she had got up with these last words she stood there before him with that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even the long habit of their life together had not closed his sense kept sharp year after year by the collation of types and signs the comparison of fine object with fine object of one degree of finish of one form of the exquisite with another the appearance of some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitoline halls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse and yet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsaken after centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality the perfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes the smoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of a creature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in worn relief round and round a precious vase she had always had odd moments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figure with which his human connection was fairly interrupted by some vague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythological and nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware was mainly of his own mind it came from his caring for precious vases only less than for precious daughters and what was more to the point still it often operated while he was quite at the same time conscious that maggie had been described even in her prettiness as prim mrs rance herself had enthusiastically used the word of her while he remembered that when once she had been told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun she had replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainly try to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association with nobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she brought her hair down very straight and flat over her temples in the constant manner of her mother who had not been a bit mythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types but mr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that he could receive impressions of sense even while positively thinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another question which in its turn led to others still do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago the condition why that of having loved so intensely that shes as you say beyond everything maggie had scarcely to reflect her answer was so prompt oh no shes beyond nothing for she has had nothing i see you must have had things to be them its a kind of law of perspective maggie didnt know about the law but she continued definite shes not for example beyond help oh well then she shall have all we can give her ill write to her he said with pleasure angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him true as this might be however there was one thing more he was an angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes me much certainly she has told me but i wont pamper you let it be enough for you it has always been one of my reasons for liking her then shes indeed not beyond everything mr verver more or less humorously observed oh it isnt thank goodness that shes in love with you its not as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before this reassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that should be corrected oh my dear ive always thought of her as a little girl ah shes not a little girl said the princess then ill write to her as a brilliant woman its exactly what she is mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little before retracing their steps they stood looking at each other as if they had really arranged something they had come out together for themselves but it had produced something more what it had produced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met his companions last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess maggie took this in it was too plain for a protest do you know what im really thinking of she asked he wondered with her eyes on him eyes of contentment at her freedom now to talk and he wasnt such a fool he presently showed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your finding her at last yourself a husband good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking then let me look right here with you her father said as they walked on xi mrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end of september had come back later on and now a couple of weeks after they were again interrupting their stay but this time with the question of their return left to depend on matters that were rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches and mrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stants arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to some promptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakening the echoes of the great stonepaved oakpanelled galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place seemed still a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spent with her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing her own and her husbands final secession at the same time as they tempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations the double door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under the influence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she came to drop into the postbox with her own hand a thick sheaf of letters they presently thereafter left the house together and drew out halfanhour on the terrace in a manner they were to revert to in thought later on as that of persons who really had been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways he traced his impression on coming to consider back to a mere three words she had begun by using about charlotte stant she simply cleared them out those had been the three words thrown off in reference to the general golden peace that the kentish october had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out for them after charlottes arrival for it was during these days that mrs rance and the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselves for departure and it was with that difference made that the sense of the whole situation showed most fair the sense of how right they had been to engage for so ample a residence and of all the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotte it would have been learned but half it would certainly not have been taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlottes light intervention had thus become a cause operating covertly but none the less actively and fanny assinghams speech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of something irresistible he could see now how this superior force had worked and he fairly liked to recover the sight little harm as he dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing the three ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffish series of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadnt known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled he had retained since his long talk with maggie the talk that had settled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friend an odd little taste as he would have described it for hearing things said about this young woman hearing so to speak what could be said about her almost as it her portrait by some eminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under the multiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young friend so different a figure now from that early playmate of maggies as to whom he could almost recall from of old the definite occasions of his having paternally lumped the two children together in the recommendation that they shouldnt make too much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed that in the light of charlottes prompt influence she had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt in fact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression to myself while they were here wishing not to put the rest of you on the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself nor even charlotte herself if you didnt happen to notice since you didnt apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant but im not i followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak of come over the poor things very much as i suppose people at the court of the borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family my comparisons only a little awkward for i dont in the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poison into their cup she was just herself their poison in the sense of mortally disagreeing with them but she didnt know it ah she didnt know it mr verver had asked with interest well i think she didnt mrs assingham had to admit that she hadnt pressingly sounded her i dont pretend to be sure in every connection of what charlotte knows she doesnt certainly like to make people suffer not in general as is the case with so many of us even other women she likes much rather to put them at their ease with her she likes that is as all pleasant people do to be liked ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on she did at the same time no doubt want to help us to put us at our ease that is she wanted to put you and to put maggie about you so far as that went she had a plan but it was only after it was not before i really believe that she saw how effectively she could work again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah she wanted to help us wanted to help me why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surprise you he just thought oh it doesnt she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didnt need each of us to go by appointment to her room at night or take her out into the fields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was rather impatient of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while he waited well of your not yourselves being so and of your not in particular i havent the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek oh she thinks me too meek and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work right in all she had to do after all was to be nice to you to a me said adam verver he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laugh for his tone to you and to every one she had only to be what she is and to be it all round if shes charming how can she help it so it was and so only that she acted as the borgia wine used to act one saw it come over them the extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other than themselves could be charming one saw them understand and exchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that its she whos the real thing ah its she whos the real thing as he had not hitherto taken it home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission in his appeal i see i see he could at least simply take it home now yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure of what the real thing was and what would it be a definitely that you understand by that she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what her effect on them is to make them recognise that they never will oh of course never it not only remained and abode with them it positively developed and deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of his personal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as real just as he had been able to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence of his daughters marriage the note of reality in so much projected light continued to have for him the charm and the importance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached in his great finds continued beyond any other to keep him attentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer had we time to look into it than this application of the same measure of value to such different pieces of property as old persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all the more indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling on his own side that he was as a taster of life economically constructed he put into his one little glass everything he raised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in his pocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glass cut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt with the arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfy himself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadino luini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he was consenting to the announcement of his daughters betrothal so it served him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had lately got wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as to which he had made out contentedly that further news was to be obtained from a certain mr gutermannseuss of brighton it was all at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where it could burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved on the idea followed by appropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect in its kind where in short in spite of the general tendency of the devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritual furniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from the undue keepingup of profane altarfires adam verver had in other words learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his own little book without having for a day raised the smallest scandal in his economy at large being in this particular not unlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company that even the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent belowstairs never feels obliged to give warning that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtless scarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negative value it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within that before the first ten days of november had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawns with his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certain abruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than his security an impulse eminently natural had stirred within the prince his life as for some time established was deliciously dull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a small gust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to her father with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her this experience he called it a serenade a low music that outside one of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest at night timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldnt close his eyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had looked out he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin all duskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the evertobeloved italy sooner or later that way one had to listen it was a hovering haunting ghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there was obviously but one way as there were doubtless also many words for the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for again seeing rome they would accordingly hadnt they better go for a little maggie meanwhile making the tooabsurdly artful point with her father so that he repeated it in his amusement to charlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious of addressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came to think the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her she doesnt count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr ververs indulgent criticism but he found charlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easy agreement with him over the question if the prince had asked something of his wife every day in the year this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit of homesickness revisit without reproach his native country what his fatherinlaw frankly counselled was that the reasonable the really too reasonable pair should while they were about it take three or four weeks of paris as well paris being always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only do that on their way back or however they preferred it charlotte and he would go over to join them there for a small look though even then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysis from maggie who having as she granted to choose between being an unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing for the former wanted to know what would become of the principino if the house were cleared of everyone but the servants her question had fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of her questions dropped still more effectively than it had risen the highest moral of the matter being before the couple took their departure that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallenged guard over the august little crib if she hadnt supremely believed in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience was in itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was a spreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as parted curtains if she hadnt been able to rest in this confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on his journey without her in the same manner if the sweetest for it was so she qualified him of little country doctors hadnt proved to her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him for hours over causes and consequences over what he had found to answer with his little five at home she would have drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere brilliant friend these persons accordingly her own predominance having thus for the time given way could carry with a certain ease and above all with mutual aid their consciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed they could help each other with it which was in fact to become as mrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of a relief and a diversion mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in the daynursery very much as he had regularly met the childs fond mother charlotte having as she clearly considered given maggie equal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for the daily letter she had promised to write she wrote with high fidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didnt write the reason of this was partly that charlotte told all about him which she also let him know she did and partly that he enjoyed feeling as a consequence that he was generally quite systematically eased and as they said done for committed as it were to this charming and clever young woman who by becoming for him a domestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow made his sense of it a deeper thing he took an interest in seeing how far the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification what fanny assingham had said at the last about the difference such a girl could make she was really making one now in their simplified existence and a very considerable one though there was no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fanny no mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help her to be felt according to fannys diagnosis as real she was real decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in time even a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assingham had seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly and immediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimate scale and at no moments more so than during those at which we have just glanced when mrs noble made them both together feel that she she alone in the absence of the queenmother was regent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on such occasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominal courtfunctionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled to the petites entrees but quite external to the state which began and ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickened sociability to what was left them of the palace there to digest their gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the true executive such snufftaking ironies as might belong to rococo chamberlains moving among china lapdogs every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite things and he had many favourites with a facility that never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itself up at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything she could play everything always shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have been playing lawntennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing his love of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses but while on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawingroom as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associations while i say he so listened to charlottes piano where the score was ever absent but between the lighted candles the picture distinct the vagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet a surface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it was a manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardly either with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces and for the most part so late that the last solemn servant had been dismissed for the night late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the stillstirring sea of other voices a word or two that affected our friend even at the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than any previous sound and then he had lingered under pretext of an opened window to be made secure after taking leave of his companion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up the staircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleeveless cape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon the terrace through one of the long drawingroom windows and moved to and fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it was where he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestive woman herself was before him again as in spite of all the previous degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been he thought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of his conviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for a while that he should never sleep again till something had come to him some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that he had begun to want but had been till now and especially the last day or two vainly groping for can you really then come if we start early that was practically all he had said to the girl as she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not when ive nothing else to do and should besides so immensely like it this had as definitely been on her side the limit of the little scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at all though he perhaps didnt quite know why something like the menace of one hadnt proceeded from her stopping halfway upstairs to turn and say as she looked down on him that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at all events while he walked appearances already familiar as well as two or three that were new and not the least vivid of the former connected itself with that sense of being treated with consideration which had become for him as we have noted one of the minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of the compensatory incidents of being a fatherinlaw it had struck him up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of which amerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessed the secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the young mans having amiably passed it on she made use for her so quietly grateful host however this might be of quite the same shades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equal degree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high in the scale of importance that was even for his own thought a clumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in the agreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for a little only because this coincidence in their felicity caused him vaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it might almost have been if such a link between them was to be imagined that amerigo had a little coached or incited their young friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one of the signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended in her profited by observing during her short opportunity before the start of the travellers the pleasant application by the prince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly it was that they so resembled each other in treating him like from what noble and propagated convention in cases in which the exquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributed nor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson but the difficulty was here of course that one could really never know couldnt know without having been ones self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just a beautiful author before such a question as before several others when they recurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the old parapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to so many of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactly what made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking in the vast freshness of the night at the breath of which disparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneath him make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himself return to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper than anything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he should in a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate his daughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he had lost her as was indeed inevitable by her own marriage he should reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred an injury or at the best an inconvenience that required some makeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this the more which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had suffered putting it with extravagance at her hands if she put it with extravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it came which she put with extravagance too from her persistence always in thinking feeling talking about him as young he had had glimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutely unforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge of the wrong she had done him to consist in his having still before him years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed a parent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldnt so much have mattered if he had been of common parental age that he wasnt that he was just her extraordinary equal and contemporary this was what added to her act the long train of its effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as a consequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxuriance of her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw his issue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held his breath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the whole place everything round him the wide terrace where he stood the others with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse of discovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them an inordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it was brief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gasp of admiration had by this time however lost itself in an intensity that quickly followed the way the wonder of it since wonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of his vision he had these several days groped and groped for an object that lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from his stupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearthstone whence it now gazed up in his face once he had recognised it there everything became coherent the sharp point to which all his light converged was that the whole call of his future to him as a father would be in his so managing that maggie would less and less appear to herself to have forsaken him and it not only wouldnt be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to her the idea shone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwise possible it stood there absolutely confronted with the material way in which it might be met the way in which it might be met was by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her at peace was to provide for his future that is for hers by marriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately as hers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshment he tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen that charlotte could contribute what he hadnt seen was what she could contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and he had simply settled this service to his daughter well before him as the proper direction of his young friends leisure the cool darkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity was constituted it wasnt only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet not have had his remedy oh if charlotte didnt accept him of course the remedy would fail but as everything had fallen together it was at least there to be tried and success would be great that was his last throb if the measure of relief effected for maggie should at all prove to have been given by his own actual sense of felicity he really didnt know when in his life he had thought of anything happier to think of it merely for himself would have been even as he had just lately felt even doing all justice to that condition yes impossible but there was a grand difference in thinking of it for his child xii it was at brighton above all that this difference came out it was during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlotte that he had acquainted himself further though doubtless not even now quite completely with the merits of his majestic scheme and while moreover to begin with he still but held his vision in place steadying it fairly with his hands as he had often steadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazed picture in its right relation to the light the other the outer presumptions in his favour those independent of what he might himself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vague that quantity i say struck him as positively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton air and on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should be able to speak and that he would the word itself being romantic pressing for him the spring of association with stories and plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks highboots had it in soliloquies ever on their lips and the sense on the first day that he should probably have taken the great step before the second was over conduced already to make him say to his companion that they must spend more than their mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what was before him he at all events definitely desired to be and it was strongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step he was acting it kept coming back to that not in the dark but in the high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but with the deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of less joy than a passion but that probably would in compensation for that loss be found to have the essential property to wear even the decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for more contingencies the season was in local parlance on the elements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty social hall swarmed with types in charlottes constant phrase and resounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded and befrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violently exotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against the perpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly have disconcerted our friends if it hadnt all happened more preponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the noble privacy of fawns had left them had left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the high pitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had been for him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested was out of the world whereas the scene actually about him with the very sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothing could have been more complete for representing that pulse of life which they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of their advisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was what charlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and there were positively current hours when it might have been open to her companion to feel himself again indebted to her for introductions he had brought her to put it crudely but it was almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety her livelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really when he came to think had ever taken him about before it had always been he of old who took others and who in particular took maggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part of an experience marking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order a flattered passive state that might become why shouldnt it one of the comforts of the future mr gutermannseuss proved on the second day our friend had waited till then a remarkably genial a positively lustrous young man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the place remote from the front and living as immediate and striking signs testified in the bosom of his family our visitors found themselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to a numerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and of children larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarce less anointed for hospitality and who produced at first the impression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariously and religiously kept though they subsequently fell into their places as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantly and directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermannseuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youth of less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in every particular he yet stood among his progeny eleven in all as he confessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yet with such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal old noses while he entertained the great american collector whom he had so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat earringed aunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable of accent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intention than that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from the habit of a person finding her account at any time according to a wisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression it really came home to her friend on the spot that this free range of observation in her picking out the frequent funny with extraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make a different thing for him of such experiences of the customary hunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his accepted monomania which different thing could probably be a lighter and perhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form of sport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermannseuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had at first scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple into another room before the threshold of which the rest of the tribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene the treasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr ververs interest had been booked established quickly enough their claim to engage the latters attention yet at what point of his past did our friends memory looking back and back catch him in any such place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded than of some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were not strange to him when they took the form of bourgeois backparlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their north light at wateringplaces prevailingly homes of humbug or even when they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life health and the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thricelocked yet often vulgar drawers and soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively ranged before him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague he didnt betray it ah that he knew but two recognitions took place for him at once and one of them suffered a little in sweetness by the confusion mr gutermannseuss had truly for the crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he was perfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses with chatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeated act of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a table so virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cotton cloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchal teas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmony and their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciation and decision was while the spectator considered simplified to a point that but just failed of representing levity on the part of a man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitely ancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcely more meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek of royalty this property of the ordered and matched array had inevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfection perceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being given to the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near to let him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentient fingers waited somehow in the predominance of charlottes very person in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermannseuss himself was capable of the right felicity of silence but with an embracing ease through it all that made deferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover by his mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behind her he couldnt otherwise have explained surely why he found himself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters than the felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with their return to the room in which they had been received and the renewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in the elated circle formed by the girls free response to the collective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genial acceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she was afterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish the touch of some mystic rite of old jewry this characterisation came from her as they walked away walked together in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and the bustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and the shining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the mask of night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearer to where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile for him quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonious hour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too a sign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may sound he found a sentimental link an obligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties of its opposite in his having exposed her to the north light the quite properly hard businesslight of the room in which they had been alone with the treasure and its master she had listened to the name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face given the relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond all retractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the other place by that high figure struck him as a thing that from the moment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself had apologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decent feeling didnt thrust his money a huge lump of it in such a way under a poor girls nose a girl whose poverty was after a fashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and this was to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minutes later after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign or two of insistence what might definitely result failed to be immediately clear he had spoken spoken as they sat together on the outoftheway bench observed during one of their walks and kept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in his memorys eye the particular spot to which between intense pauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistently led her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where the city of stucco sat most architecturally perched with the rumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars in front and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailed in lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead in the close neighbourhood of a great replete community about to assist anew at the removal of dishcovers weve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful days together that i hope it wont come to you too much as a shock when i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfaction as a husband as if he had known she wouldnt she of course couldnt at all gracefully and whether or no reply with a rush he had said a little more quite as he had felt he must in thinking it out in advance he had put the question on which there was no going back and which represented thereby the sacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to stand for the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustion sure this isnt sudden to me and ive wondered at moments if you havent felt me coming to it ive been coming ever since we left fawns i really started while we were there he spoke slowly giving her as he desired time to think all the more that it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did so a large and so far a happy consequence she wasnt at all events shocked which he had glanced at but for a handsome humility and he would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustnt think im forgetting that im not young oh that isnt so its i that am old you are young this was what she had at first answered and quite in the tone too of having taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kind which was what he most wanted and she kept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear lowered voice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems that these days have been beautiful i shouldnt be grateful to them if i couldnt more or less have imagined their bringing us to this she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step to meet him and yet were at the same time standing still it only meant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinking as he exactly desired to make her if she would but think enough she would probably think to suit him it seems to me she went on that its for you to be sure ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importance i never speak when im not so if you can yourself face such a union you neednt in the least trouble she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing it while through lamplight and dusk through the breath of the mild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to the extent of saying i wont pretend i dont think it would be good for me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because im so awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than another a motive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely that it almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showed humour in fact you know i want to be married its well its the condition the condition he was just vague its the state i mean i dont like my own miss among us all is too dreadful except for a shopgirl i dont want to be a horrible english oldmaid oh you want to be taken care of very well then ill do it i dare say its very much that only i dont see why for what i speak of she smiled for a mere escape from my state i need do quite so much so much as marry me in particular her smile was as for true directness i might get what i want for less you think it so much for you to do yes she presently said i think its a great deal then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect with him and he felt he had come on far then it was that of a sudden something seemed to fail and he didnt quite know where they were there rose for him with this the fact to be sure of their disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as she would he might have been her father of course yes thats my disadvantage im not the natural im so far from being the ideal match to your youth and your beauty ive the drawback that youve seen me always so inevitably in such another light but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction soft made it almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and he had already before she spoke the dim vision of some objection in her mind beside which the one he had named was light and which therefore must be strangely deep you dont understand me its of all that it is for you to do its of that im thinking oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you neednt think i know enough what it is for me to do but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt if you can and why not please when ive had you so before me that im old has at least that fact about it to the good that ive known you long and from far back do you think youve known me asked charlotte stant he hesitated for the tone of it and her look with it might have made him doubt just these things in themselves however with all the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed the fine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and crackling this quantity was to push him harder than any word of her own could warn him all that she was herself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pink glow he wasnt rabid but he wasnt either as a man of a proper spirit to be frightened what is that then if i accept it but as strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you she faced him always kept it up as for honesty and yet at the same time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tell whether if you did you would it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i mean when its a question of learning one learns sometimes too late i think its a question he promptly enough made answer of liking you the more just for your saying these things you should make something he added of my liking you i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted all other ways this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways why youve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew take it then he answered that im simply putting them all together for you she looked at him on this long again still as if it shouldnt be said she hadnt given him time or had withdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of her surface this at least she was fully to have exposed it represented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew in what sense it affected him on the whole however with admiration youre very very honourable its just what i want to be i dont see she added why youre not right i dont see why youre not happy as you are i can not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if youre really as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads you to assume oughtnt we she asked to think a little of others oughtnt i at least in loyalty at any rate in delicacy to think of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not to appear too much to teach him his duty she explained shes everything to you she has always been are you so certain that theres room in your life for another daughter is that what you mean she had not hung upon it long but he had quickly taken her up he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always been so different from what our marrying would make it for another companion said charlotte stant cant a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but theyve been already made as no one knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herself by her own marriage made i mean for me she constantly thinks of it it allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what im trying with you to do i cant do it alone but i can do it with your help you can make her he said positively happy about me about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make her about herself oh if shes at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands youll effectually put out of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face but it was all the more honourable to her as he had just called it that she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if youve been driven to the likes of me maynt it show that youve felt truly forsaken well im willing to suggest that if i can show at the same time that i feel consoled but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated consoled forsaken no i havent but if its her idea if it was her idea in short that was enough this enunciation of motive the next moment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that he gave it another touch that is if its my idea i happen you see to like my idea well its beautiful and wonderful but isnt it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for why so my dear child isnt a mans idea usually what he does marry for charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be a large question or at all events something of an extension of one they were immediately concerned with doesnt that a good deal depend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that about marriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question dont you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept your offer for maggies sake somehow she turned it over i dont so clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or even quite so much needing it do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leave us because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted it she could only go with him perfectly so that if you see your way she will be able to go with him in future as much as she likes charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggies interest this privilege the result of which was a limited concession youve certainly worked it out of course ive worked it out thats exactly what i have done she hadnt for a long time been so happy about anything as at your being there with me i was to be with you said charlotte for her security well adam verver rang out this is her security youve only if you cant see it to ask her ask her the girl echoed it in wonder certainly in so many words telling her you dont believe me still she debated do you mean write it to her quite so immediately tomorrow oh i dont think i can write it said charlotte stant when i write to her and she looked amused for so different a shade its about the principinos appetite and dr bradys visits very good then put it to her face to face well go straight to paris to meet them charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a small cry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with her eyes on him he keeping his seat as for the help it gave him a little to make his appeal go up presently however a new sense had come to her and she covered him kindly with the expression of it i do think you know you must rather like me thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourself then she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them if necessary till they come wait a at fawns wait in paris that will be charming in itself you take me to pleasant places she turned it over you propose to me beautiful things it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant youve made brighton ah she almost tenderly protested with what im doing now youre promising me now what i want arent you promising me he pressed getting up arent you promising me to abide by what maggie says oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean shell ask it of me it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the propriety of being himself certain yet what was he but certain shell speak to you shell speak to you for me this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we wait again to talk of it till she has done so he showed with his hands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up a certain disappointment soon enough none the less his gentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary of course i give you time especially he smiled as its time that i shall be spending with you our keeping on together will help you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you i already see said charlotte how youve persuaded yourself you do but she had to repeat it that isnt unfortunately all well then how youll make maggie right right she echoed it as if the word went far and o oh she still critically murmured as they moved together away xiii he had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later but on the spot there this period of patience suffered no great strain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent only fortyeight hours before resuming their journey and maggies reply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him at noon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel where they had agreed that he should join her for their proceeding together to the noontide meal his letter at fawns a letter of several pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all but triumphantly to inform had proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document to frame as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning had allowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasons naturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness which contributed to his message something of their own quality of impatience the main result of their talk for the time had been a difference in his relation to his young friend as well as a difference equally sensible in her relation to himself and this in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communication despatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between them it being rudimentary in their actual order that she mustnt be further worried until maggie should have put her at her ease it was just the delicacy however that in paris which suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitch made between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisional peculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in a manner of their own imposing and involving under one head many abstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express and yet creating for them at every step an acceptance of their reality he was hanging back with charlotte till another person should intervene for their assistance and yet they had by what had already occurred been carried on to something it was out of the power of other persons to make either less or greater common conventions that was what was odd had to be on this basis more thought of those common conventions that previous to the passage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense of their overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrest that paris had in its way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have been viewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew it you might be unmistakably matching them since he wished therefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playing with perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to he found himself on the receipt of maggies missive rejoicing with a certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state for so quick a jump it didnt much matter which and yet he was more eager than not for the drop of delay and for the quicker transitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair there was after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in being taken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positively desiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie from holding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poor girl but from generous rigour of conscience these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistent with a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal for it was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubts had a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over the more it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would have been charlottes simply saying to him that she didnt like him enough this he wouldnt have enjoyed but he would quite have understood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like him enough nothing to contradict that had come out for him so that he was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at him hard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look for what he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his best moment of conviction that as a man so to speak he properly pleased her he said nothing the words sufficiently did it for him doing it again better still as charlotte who had left her chair at his approach murmured them out we start tonight to bring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didnt however as she gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probably not disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale her extraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that he had always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of this change of colour and she had again with it her apparent way of subjecting herself for explicit honesty and through her willingness to face him to any view he might take all at his ease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced in her as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless he knew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as she professed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there a minute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainly she liked him enough liked him enough to make him old as he was ready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it the pleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin a little to be satisfied still however she had to think weve hurried them you see why so breathless a start because they want to congratulate us they want said adam verver to see our happiness she wondered again and this time also for him as publicly as possible so much as that do you think its too much she continued to think plainly they werent to have started for another week well what then isnt our situation worth the little sacrifice well go back to rome as soon as you like with them this seemed to hold her as he had previously seen her held just a trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would do together on a certain contingency worth it the little sacrifice for whom for us naturally yes she said we want to see them for our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes then i do too she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged for us however something depends on it rather but does nothing depend on it for them what can from the moment that as appears they dont want to nip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very little such intense eagerness i confess she went on more than a little puzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious and suspicious but the prince cant at all want to come back so soon he wanted quite too intensely to get away mr verver considered well hasnt he been away yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides said charlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of our case that you impute to her it cant in the least have appeared to him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wife a bouncing stepmother adam verver at this looked grave im afraid then hell just have to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reason just because she does that he declared will have to do for him his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which let me she abruptly said see it again taking from him the folded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isnt the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time he again stood staring but the next minute with that upward spring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pockets which she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from her in silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed the hotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loud sounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies in chairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as with wings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled some critical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waitingroom a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation or extraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he went as far as the portecochere took counsel afresh of his usual optimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air he tasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it is incredible to you that when a man is still as much in love as amerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wife feels to believe what she believes to want what she wants in the absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operated she acknowledged with no great delay this natural possibility no nothing is incredible to me of people immensely in love well isnt amerigo immensely in love she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of the degree but she after all adopted mr ververs immensely then there you are she had another smile however she wasnt there quite yet that isnt all thats wanted but what more why that his wife shall have made him really believe that she really believes with which charlotte became still more lucidly logical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case on the reality of hers the prince may for instance now she went on have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainly desire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he may remember that he has never seen her do anything else well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he have found in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such a disposition in her to lead just to this one with which she struck him as rising straighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet our little question itself her appearance had in fact at the moment such an effect on him that he could answer but in marvelling mildness hadnt we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe her rejoinder to this was to wait though by no means as long as he meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however it was mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and they exchanged for the time a look which might have made each of them seem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overt irony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr ververs face that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly produced them and as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping back she took a jump to pure plain reason you havent noticed for yourself but i cant quite help noticing that in spite of what you assume we assume if you like maggie wires her joy only to you she makes no sign of its overflow to me it was a point and staring a moment he took account of it but he had as before his presence of mind to say nothing of his kindly humour why you complain of the very thing thats most charmingly conclusive she treats us already as one clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic there was something in the way he said things she faced him in all her desire to please him and then her word quite simply and definitely showed it i do like you you know well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see whats the matter with you you wont be quiet till youve heard from the prince himself i think the happy man added that ill go and secretly wire to him that youd like reply paid a few words for yourself it could apparently but encourage her further to smile reply paid for him you mean or for me oh ill pay with pleasure anything back for you as many words as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiring either to see your message she could take it visibly as he meant it should you require to see the princes not a bit you can keep that also to yourself on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were a real question she appeared to consider and almost as if for good taste that the joke had gone far enough it doesnt matter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should it be she asked a thing that would occur to him i really think mr verver concurred that it naturally wouldnt he doesnt know youre morbid she just wondered but she agreed no he hasnt yet found it out perhaps he will but he hasnt yet and im willing to give him meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this the situation to her view would appear to have cleared had she not too quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know im morbid she hasnt the benefit well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think i feel that youll hear from her yet it had even fairly come over him under recurrent suggestion that his daughters omission was surprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for more than three minutes oh it isnt that i hold that ive a right to it charlotte the next instant rather oddly qualified and the observation itself gave him a further push very well i shall like it myself at this then as if moved by his way of constantly and more or less against his own contention coming round to her she showed how she could also always and not less gently come half way i speak of it only as the missing grace the grace thats in everything that maggie does it isnt my due she kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will have the touch it will be beautiful then come out to breakfast mr verver had looked at his watch it will be here when we get back if it isnt and charlotte smiled as she looked about for a feather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isnt it will have had but that slight fault he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had moved to meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make its charming softness brush his face for it was a wondrous product of paris purchased under his direct auspices the day before he held it there a minute before giving it up will you promise me then to be at peace she looked while she debated at his admirable present i promise you quite for ever quite for ever remember he went on to justify his demand remember that in wiring you shell naturally speak even more for her husband than she has done in wiring me it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally why our marriage puts him for you you see or puts you for him into a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to me unchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it about its making me his stepmotherinlaw or whatever i should become over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about that well amerigo can always be according to the case either as funny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message hell be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly critical looks at him failed to take up the remark he found himself moved as by a vague anxiety to add a question dont you think hes charming oh charming said charlotte stant if he werent i shouldnt mind no more should i her friend harmoniously returned ah but you dont mind you dont have to you dont have to i mean as i have its the last folly ever to care in an anxious way the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if i were you she went on if i had in my life for happiness and power and peace even a small fraction of what you have it would take a great deal to make me waste my worry i dont know she said what in the world that didnt touch my luck i should trouble my head about i quite understand you yet doesnt it just depend mr verver asked on what you call ones luck its exactly my luck that im talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when youve made me all right its only when one is right that one really has the things you speak of it isnt they he explained that make one so its the something else i want that makes them right if youll give me what i ask youll see she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and her eyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged by another interest though the court was by this time the hour of dispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite to themselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was also aware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary of the postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there a missive taken from the little cartridgebox slung over his shoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold met equally across the court charlottes marked attention to his visit so that within the minute she had advanced to our friends with her capstreamers flying and her smile of announcement as ample as her broad white apron she raised aloft a telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociably discriminated cette foisci pour madame with which she as genially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back to her companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as with the message he himself had put before her studied its contents without a sign he watched her without a question and at last she looked up ill give you she simply said what you ask the expression of her face was strange but since when had a womans at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be he took it in with his own long look and his grateful silence so that nothing more for some instants passed between them their understanding sealed itself he already felt that she had made him right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie had made her so and always therefore without maggie where in fine would he be she united them brought them together as with the click of a silver spring and on the spot with the vision of it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with her expression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does for me through it all as well that is still through the blur he saw charlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wide open but her eyes were all for his it isnt maggie its the prince i say he gaily rang out then its best of all its enough thank you for thinking so to which he added its enough for our question but it isnt is it quite enough for our breakfast dejeunons she stood there however in spite of this appeal her document always before them dont you want to read it he thought not if it satisfies you i dont require it but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you can if you like he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in her lips a little no i call it grave ah then i dont want it very grave said charlotte stant well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as they started a question for all answer to which before she took his arm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of her coat part third xiv charlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun by waiting alone waiting to be rejoined by her companion who had gone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who his duty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised but she would not have cared if she had been so little was it by this time her first occasion of facing society with a consciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never before what it was to look well to look that is as well as she had always felt from far back that in certain conditions she might on such an evening as this that of a great official party in the full flush of the london springtime the conditions affected her her nerves her senses her imagination as all profusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she been so justified of her faith as at the particular instant of our being again concerned with her that of her chancing to glance higher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence the quiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broad balustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and who immediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiar signals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her even with the other things she had to think about as the quietest note in the whole high pitch much in fact as if she had pressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the number of seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump the sight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there though so far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was about the limit of what it could suggest the air however had suggestions enough it abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditions with which for our young woman the hour was brilliantly crowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hung together melted together in light and colour and sound the unsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the other jewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that made her personal scheme a success the proved private theory that materials to work with had been all she required and that there were none too precious for her to understand and use to which might be added lastly as the strongscented flower of the total sweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis for a crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the right assurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunity for happiness unless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing the precipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword and yet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguely vocal the double stream of the coming and the going flowing together where she stood passed her brushed her treated her to much crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause but she missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairly liked to be so long as she might just as she was exposed a little to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections on the dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was a question of exposure to much more competent recognitions of her own she hoped no one would stop she was positively keeping herself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner the importance of something that had just happened she knew how she should mark it and what she was doing there made already a beginning when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw the prince come back she had an impression of all the place as higher and wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome of lustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic its marble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this was doubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause a considerable inward stir to spring from the mere vision striking as that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly and overtly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reached her and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in her relation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion of course that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for this discrimination indeed of the most evident alone yet she would have been half willing it should be guessed how she drew inspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almost anything from the individual value that through all the picture her husbands soninlaw kept for the eye deriving it from his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum of outshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if in separation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved how he affected her sight so that reappearance had in him each time a virtue of its own a kind of disproportionate intensity suggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal what did he do when he was away from her that made him always come back only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almost resembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressingroom and before the glass pressed by his need of effect retouches his makeup the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left with a truth that had all its force for her while he made her his care for their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poor wonderful man he couldnt help making it and when she raised her eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft in his gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that in spite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed the testimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre she reflected he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonel it wasnt in such places that the seed he sowed at home was ever reaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less to brave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that he moved about less like one of the guests than like some quite presentable person in charge of the police arrangements or the electric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness something definite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blighted for her to feel herself calling him to witness that the only witchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes was that of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene to her carriage notified at all events of fannys probable presence charlotte was for a while after this divided between the sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for the prudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidance and a quite other feeling an impatience that presently ended by prevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad moment over if only that she might prove to herself let alone to mrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question for herself indeed particularly it wasnt a question but something in her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and there was truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound in decency to take she might hand things back with every tender precaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed it to them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done for her not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped and turned them over tonight as happened and she recognised it more and more with the ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her tonight exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be as firm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for going through that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one take you for i want her yes i do want her to see us together and the sooner the better said it to keep her hand on him through constant diversions and made him in fact by saying it profess a momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it was fanny assingham she wanted to see who clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or once arrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in the world hasnt she often seen us together to inform him that what had elsewhere and otherwise happened didnt now matter and that she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she was about youre strange cara mia he consentingly enough dropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as they circulated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh as he had often done before on the help rendered in such situations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash a thing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear of some menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never took place of course she was strange this as they went charlotte knew for herself how could she be anything else when the situation holding her and holding him for that matter just as much had so the stamp of it she had already accepted her consciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for them all was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with a certain earnestness this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she was there with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed so youre staying on together without her the elder woman had asked and it was charlottes answer to this that had determined for them quite indeed according to the latters expectation the need of some seclusion and her companions pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone and oh distinctly it was alone that maggie had driven away her father as usual not having managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemed to wonder mr ververs reluctances not having she in fact quite intimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increased even though tonight as she admitted he had pleaded his not feeling well maggie had wished to stay with him for the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence in the event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had come but to oblige her father she had urged the two others to go without her then she had yielded for the time to mr ververs persuasion but here when they had after the long wait in the carriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the rooms before them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listened to no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotte put it the two were doubtless making together a little party at home but it was all right so charlotte also put it there was nothing in the world they liked better than these snatched felicities little parties long talks with ill come to you tomorrow and no ill come to you makebelieve renewals of their old life they were fairly at times the dear things like children playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs ververs immediate response to her friends inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot the sense of having given her plenty to think about and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was already something in fanny that made it seem still more you say your husbands ill he felt too ill to come no my dear i think not if he had been too ill i wouldnt have left him and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked she worries you know easily shes afraid of influenza of which he has had at different times though never with the least gravity several attacks but youre not afraid of it charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come to her that really to have her case out as they said with the person in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole more than hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity with nothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrust forward seemed temptingly to open besides didnt fanny at bottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just have occurred for her she didnt get something to put between the teeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of the fear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that she might have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in other lives what had just happened it pieced itself together for charlotte was that the assingham pair drifting like everyone else had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms an accidental concussion had it after the colonel over his balustrade had observed in the favouring high light her public junction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wifes curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he had thrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the way one of her young friends was going on with another he knew perfectly such at least was charlottes liberal assumption that she wasnt going on with anyone but she also knew that given the circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in some form or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitable couple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificed her the ambassador had come up to him with a message from royalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked for five minutes with sir john brinder who had been of the ambassadors company and who had rather artlessly remained with her fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same moment as someone else she didnt know someone who knew mrs assingham and also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friends competence to throw the two others immediately together and to find a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was the little history of the vision in her that was now rapidly helping her to recognise a precious chance the chance that mightnt again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above all it was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one not even amerigo amerigo least of all who would have nothing to do with it had given her aid to make it now with force for fanny assinghams benefit would see her further in the direction in which the light had dawned than any other spring she should yet awhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that of her greater freedom which was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assinghams almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may for ourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a person holding out a small mirror at arms length and consulting it with a special turn of the head it was in a word with this value of her chance that she was intelligently playing when she said in answer to fannys last question dont you remember what you told me on the occasion of something or other the other day that you believe theres nothing im afraid of so my dear dont ask me maynt i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case stands with your poor husband certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightnt perhaps know what to think it seems to me best to let you see that i know perfectly what to think mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took her risk you didnt think that if it was a question of anyones returning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourself should have gone well charlottes answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself in the interest of the highest considerations the highest considerations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldnt be perfectly frank and dear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldnt it that we shouldnt talk about anything at all which however would be dreadful and we certainly at any rate havent yet come to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because dont you see you cant upset me im sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i dont want to upset you indeed love you simply couldnt even if you thought it necessary thats all i mean nobody could for it belongs to my situation that im by no merit of my own just fixed fixed as fast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion im placed i cant imagine anyone more placed there i am fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons for striving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety of intelligence i dare say but your statement of your position however you see it isnt an answer to my inquiry it seems to me at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to give but the more reason for it you speak of our being frank how can we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off through finding herself too distressed to stay and if shes willing to leave you and her husband to show here without her arent the grounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable if theyre not charlotte replied its only from their being in a way too evident theyre not grounds for me they werent when i accepted adams preference that i should come tonight without him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule all his preferences but that doesnt alter the fact of course that my husbands daughter rather than his wife should have felt she could after all be the one to stay with him the one to make the sacrifice of this hour seeing especially that the daughter has a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation ive simply to see the truth of the matter see that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathers than of husbands and my situation is such she went on that this becomes immediately dont you understand a thing i have to count with mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying not to show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesnt adore the prince i dont say she doesnt adore him what i say is that she doesnt think of him one of those conditions doesnt always at all stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world after all why he and i shouldnt as you say show together weve shown together my dear she smiled before her friend for a little only looked at her speaking then with abruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with such good people the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whose face however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance it had caused the next instant further to brighten does one ever put into words anything so fatuously rash its a thing that must be said in prudence for one by somebody whos so good as to take the responsibility the more that it gives one always a chance to show ones best manners by not contradicting it certainly youll never have the distress or whatever of hearing me complain truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elder womans spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than was quite advised by their pursuit of privacy to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all our absence after marriage and with the separation from her produced in particular by our so many months in america maggie has still arrears still losses to make up still the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed his company a large allowance of which is in spite of everything else of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when she can a little here a little there and it ends by making up a considerable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlotte hastened to declare makes her really see more of him than when they had the same house to make sure she doesnt fail of it shes always arranging for it which she didnt have to do while they lived together but she likes to arrange charlotte steadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result of our separate households is really for them more contact and more intimacy tonight for instance has been practically an arrangement she likes him best alone and its the way said our young woman in which he best likes her its what i mean therefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know ones place doesnt it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heaped dish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feast so thick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech but she also felt that to plunge at random to help herself too freely would apart from there not being at such a moment time for it tend to jostle the ministering hand confound the array and more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have to arrange certainly i have to arrange and the prince also if the effect for him is the same really i think not less and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up his arrears the question had risen to her lips it was as if another morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of it struck her own ear immediately as giving out more of her thought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw that she must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and that what was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up i mean by coming to see you charlotte replied however without as her friend would have phrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it was beautifully gentle he never comes oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise otherwise and fanny was still vague it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at hand again the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped a moment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparently the highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for three months and then as with her friends last word in her ear otherwise yes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too its too absurd we shouldnt meet youve met i gather said fanny assingham tonight yes as far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both are go to see him and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravity or for irony hang fire a minute i have been but thats nothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to show you how our situation works it essentially becomes one a situation for both of us the princes however is his own affair i meant but to speak of mine your situations perfect mrs assingham presently declared i dont say it isnt taken in fact all round i think it is and i dont as i tell you complain of it the only thing is that i have to act as it demands of me to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver isnt it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what do you want me to do less i want you to believe that youre a very fortunate person do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from the point of view of my freedom i call it more let it take my position any name you like dont let it at any rate and mrs assinghams impatience prevailed at last over her presence of mind dont let it make you think too much of your freedom i dont know what you call too much for how can i not see it as it is youd see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave you the same liberty and i havent to tell you with your so much greater knowledge of everything what it is that gives such liberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte went on you only know the state of neither needing it nor missing it your husband doesnt treat you as of less importance to him than some other woman ah dont talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr ververs perfectly natural interest in his daughter the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte took it up in all readiness i do distinctly and in spite of my having done all i could think of to make him capable of a greater ive done earnestly everything i could ive made it month after month my study but i havent succeeded it has been vividly brought home to me tonight however she pursued ive hoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at the time i was duly warned and then as she met in her friends face the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that he wanted me just because i could be useful about her with which charlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am it was on fanny assinghams lips for the moment to reply that this was on the contrary exactly what she didnt see she came in fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quite failed to help his idea to work since by your account maggie has him not less but so much more on her mind how in the world with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much of what was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeper things than she had yet dared to fear that there was more in it than any admission she had made represented and she had held herself familiar with admissions so that not to seem to understand where she couldnt accept and not to seem to accept where she couldnt approve and could still less with precipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of casting no weight whatever into the scales of her young friends consistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enough to feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed away everything i cant conceive my dear what youre talking about charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and her colour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had looked as if twenty protests blocking each others way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection was always the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then give you up you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i most deserve a friends loyalty if you do youre not just fanny youre even i think she went on rather cruel and its least of all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in order to cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with the noblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighted disappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patient and lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposed that she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy the last word as it is called in such cases with a perfection void of any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truths sake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrel with my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain but i can carry them out alone she said as she turned away she turned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquy with their fieldmarshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failed to penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence was temporarily bathed she had made her point the point she had foreseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once for all so that no more making was required and her success was reflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance she at first but watched this reflection taking no note of any less adequate form of it possibly presented by poor fanny poor fanny left to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so few strokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador was saying in french what he was apparently repeating to her a desire for your presence madame has been expressed en treshaut lieu and ive let myself in for the responsibility to say nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful of your friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to the odd formula of societies subject to the greatest personages possible sent for her and she asked in her surprise what in the world does he want to do to me only to know without looking that fannys bewilderment was called to a still larger application and to hear the prince say with authority indeed with a certain prompt dryness you must go immediately its a summons the ambassador using authority as well had already somehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into his arm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned to fanny assingham he would explain afterwards besides which she would understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend no explanation at all would be necessary xv it may be recorded none the less that the prince was the next moment to see how little any such assumption was founded alone with him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send for charlotte through you no my dear as you see through the ambassador ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarterofanhour have been for them as one hes your ambassador it may indeed be further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the more she saw in it theyve connected her with you shes treated as your appendage oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimed cara mia what a name shes treated rather say as my ornament and my glory and its so remarkable a case for a motherinlaw that you surely cant find fault with it youve ornaments enough it seems to me as youve certainly glories enough without her and shes not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your motherinlaw in such a matter a shade of difference is enormous shes no relation to you whatever and if shes known in high quarters but as going about with you then then she failed however as from positive intensity of vision then then what he asked with perfect goodnature she had better in such a case not be known at all but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her do you suppose i asked them said the young man still amused if they didnt want to see her you surely dont need to be shown that charlotte speaks for herself that she does so above all on such an occasion as this and looking as she does tonight how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how he would say it besides there is always the fact that were of the same connection of what is your word the same concern were certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances were in the same boat and the prince smiled with a candour that added an accent to his emphasis fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner it caused her to turn for a moments refuge to a corner of her general consciousness in which she could say to herself that she was glad she wasnt in love with such a man as with charlotte just before she was embarrassed by the difference between what she took in and what she could say what she felt and what she could show it only appears to me of great importance that now that you all seem more settled here charlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husbands wife known in the least possible degree as anything else i dont know what you mean by the same boat charlotte is naturally in mr ververs boat and pray am i not in mr ververs boat too why but for mr ververs boat i should have been by this time and his quick italian gesture an expressive direction and motion of his forefinger pointed to deepest depths away down down down she knew of course what he meant how it had taken his fatherinlaws great fortune and taken no small slice to surround him with an element in which all too fatally weighted as he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and with this reminder other things came to her how strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some people to be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in the stockmarket so high and how still stranger perhaps that there should be cases in which for some reason one didnt mind the so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really to represent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take in this specimen of the class didnt suffer from his consent to be merely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldnt suffer to whatever proof they were put and partly because besides he after all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return for services rendered he was a huge expense assuredly but it had been up to now her conviction that his idea was to behave beautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out by continuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly to think the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctly perceiving as to have even been moved more than once to express to him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour as against other matters yet it discouraged her too and rather oddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show her that he moved on the firm ground of the truth his acknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but she could find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominous intimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out of his next word lightly as he produced it isnt it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing us together a benefactor in common and the effect for his interlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehow feel half the time as if he were her fatherinlaw too its as if he had saved us both which is a fact in our lives or at any rate in our hearts to make of itself a link dont you remember he kept it up how the day she suddenly turned up for you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnily talked in her presence of the advisability for her of some good marriage and then as his friends face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the black flag of general repudiation well we really began then as it seems to me the work of placing her where she is we were wholly right and so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown by its success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the very best that was really what we meant wasnt it only what she has got something thoroughly good it would be difficult it seems to me for her to have anything better once you allow her the way its to be taken of course if you dont allow her that the case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge shell be quite contented with you may say that will be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humble about it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with any sort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite as quietly as it might be given the boat you see the prince explained it no less considerately and lucidly is a good deal tied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs and youll probably perceive if you give it your attention that charlotte really cant help occasionally doing the same it isnt even a question sometimes of ones getting to the dock one has to take a header and splash about in the water call our having remained here together tonight call the accident of my having put them put our illustrious friends there on my companions track for i grant you this as a practical result of our combination call the whole thing one of the harmless little plunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not take them when they occur as inevitable and above all as not endangering life or limb we shant drown we shant sink at least i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreover do her the justice visibly knows how to swim he could easily go on for she didnt interrupt him fanny felt now that she wouldnt have interrupted him for the world she found his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that she didnt in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermost attention really received it on the spot and she had even already the vision of how in the snug laboratory of her afterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it there were moments positively still beyond this when with the meeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out for her in his look when something strange and subtle and at variance with his words something that gave them away glimmered deep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finer comprehension what inconceivably was it like wasnt it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairly like a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of their really treating their subject of course on some better occasion and thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mind as the headlight of an approaching train seen through the length of a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a mere subjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense of what the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subject did at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded with just the same perfect possession of his thought on the manner of which he couldnt have improved to complete his successful simile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touch for which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to be known to people so intensely and exclusively as her husbands wife something is wanted that you know they havent exactly got he should manage to be known or at least to be seen a little more as his wifes husband you surely must by this time have seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his own ways and that he makes more and more as of course he has a perfect right to do his own discriminations hes so perfect so ideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact a generous a comfortable an admirable fatherinlaw that i should really feel it base to avail myself of any standpoint whatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make just one remark for youre not stupid you always understand so blessedly what one means he paused an instant as if even this one remark might be difficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him to produce it nothing would have induced her however to encourage him she was now conscious of having never in her life stood so still or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like the horse of the adage brought and brought by her own fault to the water but strong for the occasion in the one fact that she couldnt be forced to drink invited in other words to understand she held her breath for fear of showing she did and this for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraid to it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it had sounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness it would have for her special sensibility but her companion from an inward and different need of his own was presently not deterred by her silence what i really dont see is why from his own point of view given that is his conditions so fortunate as they stood he should have wished to marry at all there it was then exactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressing to her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as they used to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in public which could be prevented but by her breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treating their discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wanted to go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before to come she wanted to leave well behind her both her question and the couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid form but it was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become danger such light as from open crevices it let in and the overt recognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst in fact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and still not overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble and with that she was lost im afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress you for which i beg your pardon weve always talked so well together it has been from the beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as such a tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her now at his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it we shall talk again all the same better than ever i depend on it too much dont you remember what i told you so definitely one day before my marriage that moving as i did in so many ways among new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you as my original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i beg you to believe he added that i look to you yet his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affected her as bringing her help with which at least she could hold up her head to speak ah you are through you were through long ago or if you arent you ought to be well then if i ought to be its all the more reason why you should continue to help me because very distinctly i assure you im not the new things or ever so many of them are still for me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptions still contain an immense element that ive failed to puzzle out as weve happened so luckily to find ourselves again really taking hold together you must let me as soon as possible come to see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse it me and he addressed himself to her continued reserve i shall feel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequate vessel she could bear her own her private reference to the weight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it too horribly press oh i deny responsibility to you so far as i ever had it ive done with it he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made his look now penetrate her again more as to whom then do you confess it ah mio caro thats if to anyone my own business he continued to look at her hard you give me up then it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and its coming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree together for what youll say to me but she was glad afterwards to have checked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhaps bettered it i think i dont know what to make of you you must receive me at least he said oh please not till im ready for you and though she found a laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned away from him before and it was quite positively for her as if she were altogether afraid of him xvi later on when their hired brougham had with the long vociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated from the endless rank she rolled into the london night beside her husband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffle herself and draw breath she had stood for the previous halfhour in a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance it fairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what she was most immediately feeling was that she had in the past been active for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit and that might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first in her corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the common indifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops and darkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a world mercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldnt like the world she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibility itself so hard however for a few moments that the misery of her fear produced the next minute a reaction and when the carriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straight shaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his inquisitive flash over an opposite housefront she let herself wince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest not less quickly against mere blind terror it had become for the occasion preposterously terror of which she must shake herself free before she could properly measure her ground the perception of this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there she could none the less give it no name the sense of seeing was strong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sure of what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longer view was a help in turn to not making out that her hands were embrued since if she had stood in the position of a producing cause she should surely be less vague about what she had produced this further in its way was a step toward reflecting that when ones connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in fact recognised that she couldnt be as curious as she desired without arriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when she broke into speech its only their defending themselves so much more than they need its only that that makes me wonder its their having so remarkably much to say for themselves her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remaining apparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you mean it makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she made no answer the colonel added what in the world did you ever suppose was going to happen the mans in a position in which he has nothing in life to do her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husbands company pursued an independent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the most part herself yet she addressed herself with him as she could never have done without him he has behaved beautifully he did from the first ive thought it all along wonderful of him and ive more than once when ive had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels it isnt a question of course however she undivertedly went on of their behaving beautifully apart its a question of their doing as they should when together which is another matter and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one would say the better if you see so much in it his wife at this appeared to hear him i dont see in it what youd see and dont my dear she further answered think it necessary to be horrid or low about them theyre the last people really to make anything of that sort come in right im surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone but my extravagant wife i can do with all our friends as i see them myself what i cant do with is the figures you make of them and when you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled it again in smoke my additions dont matter when youve not to pay the bill with which her meditation again bore her through the air the great thing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasnt afraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have prevented it and if i had seen he was if i hadnt seen he wasnt so said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i its perfectly true she went on it was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his not keeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature it was so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would have been if charlotte herself couldnt have faced it then if she had not had confidence we might have talked but she had it to any amount did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hope of reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring of response never never it wasnt a time to ask asking is suggesting and it wasnt a time to suggest one had to make up ones mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge and i judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it for which she struck me at the time as for so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive her for would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks have remained most due that is to mrs assingham she said nothing for a little there were after all alternatives maggie herself of course astonishing little maggie is maggie then astonishing too and he gloomed out of his window his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the same look im not sure that i dont begin to see more in her than dear little person as ive always thought i ever supposed there was im not sure that putting a good many things together im not beginning to make her out rather extraordinary you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked again his companion said nothing then again she broke out in fact i do begin to feel it maggies the great comfort im getting hold of it it will be she wholl see us through in fact shell have to and shell be able touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with a cumulative effect for her husbands general sense of her method that caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and that fanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginal homeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy if she is however mrs assingham continued shell be extraordinary enough and thats what im thinking of but im not indeed so very sure she added of the person to whom charlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean im not sure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealist who has made her his wife i shouldnt think you would be love the colonel with some promptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incredible little idealist his cigar in short once more could alone express it yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck one as more or less persuaded that she herself was really going to be this memory for the full view fanny found herself also invoking it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incredible little idealist charlotte herself and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she was unmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left of it and that i see happens to be another of the questions you cant ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as if you were playing some game with its rules drawn up though whos to come down on you if you break them i dont quite see or must you do it in three guesses like forfeits on christmas eve to which as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able to go on with it i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared while theres a scrap as big as your nail but were not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the while the thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs ververs obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if her debt was not to the others even then it ought to be quite sufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight for what really did the prince do she asked herself but generously trust her what did he do but take it from her that if she felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued a duty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which shell be really a fiend if she doesnt make the law of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldnt interfere with him expressed by his holding himself quiet at the critical time the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense of ebbing opportunity that caused the colonels next meditation to flower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they were united for the most part but by his exhausted patience so that indulgent despair was generally at the best his note he at present however actually compromised with his despair to the extent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh a sympathising question gratitude to the prince for not having put a spoke in her wheel that you mean should taking it in the right way be precisely the ballast of her boat taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso but doesnt it rather depend on what she may most feel to be the right way no it depends on nothing because theres only one way for duty or delicacy oh delicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured i mean the highest kind moral charlottes perfectly capable of appreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she must let him alone then youve made up your mind its all poor charlotte he asked with an effect of abruptness the effect whether intended or not reached her brought her face short round it was a touch at which she again lost her balance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of her recovered comfort then youve made up yours differently it really struck you that there is something the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off he had felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of the question perhaps thats just what shes doing showing him how much shes letting him alone pointing it out to him from day to day did she point it out by waiting for him tonight on the staircase in the manner you described to me i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in the imputation yes for once in a way in those few words we had after you had watched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didnt tell me very much that you couldnt for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received your impression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have been something out of the way for you so to betray it she was fully upon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibility to the occasion confronted him because of her own uneasy need to profit by it it came over her still more than at the time it came over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must have been much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him to pack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision the very plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escape she should have it at hand for reference come my dear you thought what you thought in the presence of what you saw you couldnt resist thinking i dont ask more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mine so that you cant pretend as usual that mine has run away with me i havent caught up with you i stay where i am but i see she concluded where you are and im much obliged to you for letting me you give me a point de repere outside myself which is where i like it now i can work round you their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and it was on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made no movement they were in a high degree votaries of the latchkey so that their household had gone to bed and as they were unaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it was so indeed that for a minute bob assingham waited conscious of a reason for replying to this address otherwise than by the so obvious method of turning his back he didnt turn his face but he stared straight before him and his wife had already perceived in the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never cared what she said and his neglect of his chance to show it was thereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked to them leave it she wondered let them alone theyll manage theyll manage you mean to do everything they want ah there then you are theyll manage in their own way the colonel almost cryptically repeated it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on the familiar phenomenon of her husbands indurated conscience it gave her full in her face the particular evocation of which she had made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverly thats your idea that no one will be the wiser its your idea that we shall have done all thats required of us if we simply protect them the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawn into a statement of his idea statements were too much like theories in which one lost ones way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which his confirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to make for which he took another instant but he made it for the third time in the same fashion theyll manage in their own way with which he got out oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect and while he mounted their steps she but stared without following him at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and as he stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall lean figure outlined in darkness and with his crushhat according to his wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemed to prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general on these returns he came back for her when he had prepared their entrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her in closer quarters he looked at her across the interval and still in her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view of everything flare up wasnt it simply what had been written in the princes own face beneath what he was saying didnt it correspond with the mocking presence there that she had had her troubled glimpse of wasnt in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for his chance to invite her to take from him her husbands tone somehow fitted amerigos look the one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front she had not then read it but wasnt she reading it when she now saw in it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasnt to be squared and while she heard her companion call across to her well whats the matter she also took time to remind herself that she had decided she couldnt be frightened the matter why it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that she had been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakiness in charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulated it would be she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he had come so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothing to choose between them it made her so helpless that as the time passed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairly drew her forth after which on the pavement under the streetlamp their very silence might have been the mark of something grave their silence eked out for her by his giving her his arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had a disappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house of mourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury as decently as possible her mistake xvii it appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinary freedom the two friends from the moment they should understand their position aright with the prince himself from an early stage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of their so understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describe to him this necessity and her resignation tempered or her intelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony she applied at different times different names to the propriety of their case the wonderful thing was that her sense of propriety had been from the first especially alive about it there were hours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she called the commonest tact as if this principle alone would suffice to light their way there were others when it might have seemed to listen to her that their course would demand of them the most anxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by fingerposts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to be tracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation was unprecedented so their heaven was without stars do she once had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly though briefly occurring between them on her return from the visit to america that had immediately succeeded her marriage determined for her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the like strange order had been prescribed in his own case isnt the immense the really quite matchless beauty of our position that we have to do nothing in life at all nothing except the usual necessary everyday thing which consists in ones not being more of a fool than one can help thats all but thats as true for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but its all theirs every inch of it its all a matter of what theyve done to us and she showed how the question had therefore been only of their taking everything as everything came and all as quietly as might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to a conscientious a wellmeaning a perfectly passive pair no more extraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victims than this of forcing them against their will into a relation of mutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particular prolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusion to these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell on the element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play up into his irresistible eyes and this because she considered with pride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off his guard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted so very hard against their destiny and she knew well enough of course what in this connection was at the bottom of his thought and what would have sounded out more or less if he had not happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enough to catch when they might at such chances for dissent for all the good it really did them but the princes distinction was in being one of the few who could check himself before acting on the impulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in his simplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we faced your remarkable marriage quite handsomely of course using the plural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute of memory to the telegram she had received from him in paris after mr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctory she had never destroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was still carefully reserved she kept it in a safe place from which very privately she sometimes took it out to read it over a la guerre comme a la guerre then it had been couched in the french tongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmed with your courage and almost surprised at my own the message had remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was uphill work for him a daily fightingmatter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the event would compel him to live still more under arms it might mean on the other hand that he found he was happy enough and that accordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger she was to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasoned and secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had not asked if the document were still in her possession such an inquiry everything implied was beneath him just as it was beneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she had instantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegram to mr verver and that if this companion had but said the word she would immediately have put it before him she had thereby forborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such an exposure would in all probability straightway have dished her marriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hung by the single hair of mr ververs delicacy as she supposed they must call it and that her position in the matter of responsibility was therefore inattackably straight for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measured allowance had originally much helped him helped him in the sense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite of which it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten at first more than anything else separations delays and intervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from the moment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question of what to do with it less of it was required for the state of being married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that but gave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with it with his wedded condition helped him really so much that it made all the difference in the degree in which he rendered it the service on mr ververs part was remarkable as indeed what service from the first of their meeting had not been he was living he had been living these four or five years on mr ververs services a truth scarcely less plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of his gratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to the latter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet he would even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on its own merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of the particular treat at his fatherinlaws expense that he more and more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months and months to arrive at a full appreciation he couldnt originally have given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by the time the name had flowered in his mind he was practically living at the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took care of his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently always would of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety about his married life in the same manner in which he relieved him on the score of his bankaccount and as he performed the latter office by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang as directly from his good understanding with his daughter this understanding had wonderfully that was in high evidence the same deep intimacy as the commercial the financial association founded far down on a community of interest and the correspondence for the prince carried itself out in identities of character the vision of which fortunately rather tended to amuse than to as might have happened irritate him those people and his free synthesis lumped together capitalists and bankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathersinlaw american fathers little american daughters little american wives those people were of the same large lucky group as one might say they were all at least of the same general species and had the same general instincts they hung together they passed each other the word they spoke each others language they did each other turns in this last connection it of course came up for our young man at a given moment that maggies relation with him was also on the perceived basis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of the matter it was a funny situation that is it was funny just as it stood their married life was in question but the solution was not less strikingly before them it was all right for himself because mr verver worked it so for maggies comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for her husbands the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly on the princes side might have shown for particularly true one dark day on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance the reflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours for him and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them but loosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he might find the princess at tea but though the fireside service of the repast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called while he measured again and again the stretch of polished floor he could have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her at this moment and her not coming in as the halfhour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely the circumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might have been feeling just there he could best take his note this observation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a dreary little crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular his repeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of the ebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of the quality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarce expressed however the impatience of desire any more than they stood for sharp disappointment the series together resembled perhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearness through which for a watcher of the east dawn at last trembles into rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind the prospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter the march afternoon judged at the window had blundered back into autumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of the rain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for the young man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slowjogging fourwheeled cab which awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at the apparent instance of a person within began to make for the lefthand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the princes windows the person within alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady who left the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quickly crossed the wet interval that separated her from the house she but flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him for some minutes motionless charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby fourwheeler and a waterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climax of his special inner vision was an apparition charged with a congruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while he stood waiting a singular intensity though after some minutes had passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she had not come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning below that the princess had not returned she was merely leaving a message writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing this thought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him she would doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visit to him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason for leaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking no step he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking into sight while the superficial conditions were so against her was a harmony with conditions that were far from superficial and that gave for his imagination an extraordinary value to her presence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigour of his own attitude with the fact too that listening hard he neither heard the housedoor close again nor saw her go back to her cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had become aware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butler up to the landing from which his room opened if anything could further then have added to it the renewed pause outside as if she had said to the man wait a moment would have constituted this touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced to the teatable to light the lamp under the kettle and had then busied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easy for her host to drop straight from any height of tension and to meet her provisionally on the question of maggie while the butler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggie that in spite of this attendants high blankness on the subject of all possibilities on that ladys part she would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of a rocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as she stood and looked at him what else my dear what in the world else can we do it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had felt as if he in fact knew within the minute things he had not known even while she was panting as from the effect of the staircase at the door of the room he knew at the same time none the less that she knew still more than he in the sense that is of all the signs and portents that might count for them and his vision of alternative she could scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitude by the chimneyplace the way she looked at him as through the gained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble and her left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out a foot to dry he couldnt have told what particular links and gaps had at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed and bridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which the picture could have been so exactly copied he remembered that is none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddy fourwheeler waited and while though having left her waterproof downstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquence the positive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make a point of insisting on their time of life and their moral intention the hats and the frocks own as well as on the irony of indifference to them practically playing in her so handsome rainfreshened face the sense of the past revived for him nevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other time somehow meet the future close interlocking with it before his watching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and so handling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarce retained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there to be wounded or shocked what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by a single turn of the wrist of fate led up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missed been placed face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself without their toil almost without their touch above all on this occasion once more there sounded through their safety as an undertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of his marriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again and again from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him why it kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a way that filled the room the reason was into which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarterofanhour that just this truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampled receptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same time elastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as with billows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there had been however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the tale this afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte had come to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitely began with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was the meaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they were alone even though indeed as from not quite understanding he had not then directly replied it was the meaning of everything else down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him a little the question of these eccentricities to let her immediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her instead what had become of her carriage and why above all she was not using it in such weather its just because of the weather she explained its my little idea it makes me feel as i used to when i could do as i liked xviii this came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth it expressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him but did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort it seems to me now that i then liked everything its the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of trying again the old feelings they come back they come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking at her looking hard at the teatable ah i havent your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea he quickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup he busied himself with this care and she sat down on his pushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired he moved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit as the moments passed had more and more the effect of a signal communication that she had come all responsibly and deliberately as on the clear show of the clockface of their situation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deeper sincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the facts invoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of their seeing their way together to which indeed exactly the present occasion appeared to have so much to contribute its not that you havent my courage charlotte said but that you havent i rather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn out after all she added that you havent even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till youve given me more proof and she made again but more clearly her point of a moment before you knew besides you knew today i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and if he didnt meanwhile if he didnt even at this take her up it might be that she was so positively fitting him again with the fair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keep her eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense of which she might ever since have been carrying about with her like a precious medal not exactly blessed by the pope suspended round her neck she had come back however this might be to her immediate account of herself and no mention of their great previous passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i dont think even my intelligence fails me oh its further than that goes and if ive had a better day than you its perhaps when i come to think of it that i am braver you bore yourself you see but i dont i dont i dont she repeated its precisely boring ones self without relief he protested that takes courage passive then not active my romance is that if you want to know ive been all day on the town literally on the town isnt that what they call it i know how it feels after which as if breaking off and you have you never been out she asked he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what should i have gone out for oh what should people in our case do anything for but youre wonderful all of you you know how to live were clumsy brutes we others beside you we must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might have missed the chance of me which im sure though you wont confess it was what you didnt want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will ive come to congratulate you on thats really what i can at last do you cant not know at least on such a day as this you cant not know she said where you are she waited as for him either to grant that he knew or to pretend that he didnt but he only drew a long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience it brushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew it seemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitor herself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated the matter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of the time of having considerably brought it on this was sufficiently marked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as i verily believe was never before in the world thrust upon two wellmeaning creatures havent we therefore to take things as we find them she put the question still more directly than that of a moment before but to this one as well he returned no immediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea he relieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked her what more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position by a small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got up again and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she had first frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the world else he took them up however no more than at first where then have you been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure everywhere i could think of except to see people i didnt want people i wanted too much to think but ive been back at intervals three times and then come away again my cabman must think me crazy its very amusing i shall owe him when we come to settle more money than he has ever seen ive been my dear she went on to the british museum which you know i always adore and ive been to the national gallery and to a dozen old booksellers coming across treasures and ive lunched on some strange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go to the tower but it was too far my old man urged that and i would have gone to the zoo if it hadnt been too wet which he also begged me to observe but you wouldnt believe i did put in st pauls such days she wound up are expensive for besides the cab ive bought quantities of books she immediately passed at any rate to another point i cant help wondering when you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it had apparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie i mean and the child for i suppose you know hes with her oh yes i know hes with her i saw them this morning and did they then announce their programme she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno and for the whole day he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted she didnt say and i didnt ask well she went on it cant have been later than halfpast ten i mean when you saw them they had got to eaton square before eleven you know we dont formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our rooms at least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing the child a picturebook maggie had been there with them had left them settled together then she had gone out taking the carriage for something he had been intending but that she offered to do instead the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest taking you mean your carriage i dont know which and it doesnt matter its not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less its not a question even if you come to that of a cab its so beautiful she said that its not a question of anything vulgar or horrid which she gave him time to agree about and though he was silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i went out i wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important it has been it is important i know as i havent known before the way they feel i couldnt in any other way have made so sure of it they feel a confidence the prince observed he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and she proceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the course of her wild ramble had witnessed her return for curiosity and even really a little from anxiety to eaton square she was possessed of a latchkey rarely used it had always irritated adam one of the few things that did to find servants standing up so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cab at the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i went without their so much as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of one not so much sentimentally or morally so to call it and since that doesnt matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really ever was or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quite without a conscience they must even in their odd way she declared have some idea oh theyve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothing was easier than to mention the quantity they think so much of us they think in particular so much of you ah dont put it all on me she smiled but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared the place its a matter of your known character ah thank you for known she still smiled its a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm its a matter of what those things have done for you in the world i mean in this world and this place youre a personage for them and personages do go and come oh no my dear there youre quite wrong and she laughed now in the happier light they had diffused thats exactly what personages dont do they live in state and under constant consideration they havent latchkeys but drums and trumpets announce them and when they go out in growlers it makes a greater noise still its you caro mio she said who so far as that goes are the personage ah he in turn protested dont put it all on me what at any rate when you get home he added shall you say that youve been doing i shall say beautifully that ive been here all day yes all day keeping you company in your solitude how can we understand anything she went on without really seeing that this is what they must like to think i do for you just as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us to learn to take them as they are he considered this a while in his restless way but with his eyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel more than anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meet this and he quickly perceived the effect they would have done the same for one of yours ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed said charlotte that that would happen it would have been better it would have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poor duck that it might have been im sure he hoped and intended so its not at any rate she went on my fault there it is she had uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly and responsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she paused briefly but as if once for all she made her clearness complete and now im too sure it will never be he waited for a moment never never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity but with a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added but things turn out and it leaves us she made the point more alone he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone oh she again returned dont put it all on me maggie would have given herself to his child im sure scarcely less than he gives himself to yours it would have taken more than any child of mine she explained it would have taken more than ten children of mine could i have had them to keep our sposi apart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as he seemed to take it in spite of this for important she then spoke gravely enough its as strange as you like but were immensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were moments when again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these last words which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that youve been doing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes in for i suppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must say the same thing well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have had what i havent ah what havent you had what arent you having her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he still took it before he answered from her eyes we must at least then not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her its all in the world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows she said they do so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission the case could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared to come over him at the same time as too much for him so that he fell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him the difficulty is and will always be that i dont understand them i didnt at first but i thought i should learn to that was what i hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might help me oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us to which charlotte at first said nothing as if from the sense of too much then indulgently enough she shook her head were beyond her he thought a moment as of where this placed them shed do anything then for them well so would we so that doesnt help us she has broken down she doesnt understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesnt matter he wondered again unless as taking care of them ah charlotte instantly said isnt it for us only to do that she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty i think we want no ones aid she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective for coming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through the complicated twist by which any effort to protect the father and the daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it moved him in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one had suddenly been broken by it these things all the while the privilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance of his own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back to show her that he was not in their so special situation without a responsible view a conception that he could name and could act on was something that now at last not to be too eminent a fool he was required by all the graces to produce and the luminous idea she had herself uttered would have been his expression of it she had anticipated him but as her expression left for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt rather righted than wronged a large response as he looked at her came into his face a light of excited perception all his own in the glory of which as it almost might be called what he gave her back had the value of what she had given him theyre extraordinarily happy oh charlottes measure of it was only too full beatifically thats the great thing he went on so that it doesnt matter really that one doesnt understand besides you do enough i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i dont understand your wife youre of the same race at any rate more or less of the same general tradition and education of the same moral paste there are things you have in common with them but i on my side as ive gone on trying to see if i havent some of these things too i on my side have more and more failed there seem at last to be none worth mentioning i cant help seeing it im decidedly too different yet youre not charlotte made the important point too different from me i dont know as were not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss of divergence since it depends on that then she smiled im safe as you are anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark theyre very very simple that makes she added a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken it in it makes less difficulty for action i have at last for myself i think taken it in im not afraid he wondered a moment not afraid of what well generally of some beastly mistake especially of any mistake founded on ones idea of their difference for that idea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender ah but rather well then there it is i cant put myself into maggies skin i cant as i say its not my fit i shouldnt be able as i see it to breathe in it but i can feel that id do anything to shield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she went on i think im still more so for my husband hes in truth of a sweet simplicity the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i dont know that i can choose at night all cats are grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to stand toward them and how to do ourselves justice we do it represents for us a conscious care of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to the highest measure of the facts and for which we must trust each other oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the prince hastened to add we can with which as for the full assurance and the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found their hands its all too wonderful firmly and gravely she kept his hand its too beautiful and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and as closely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seen them they were silent at first only facing and faced only grasping and grasped only meeting and met its sacred he said at last its sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave it out and took it in drawn by their intensity more closely together then of a sudden through this tightened circle as at the issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everything broke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lips sought their lips their pressure their response and their response their pressure with a violence that had sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses they passionately sealed their pledge xix he had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fanny assingham didnt now matter the now he had even himself supplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlier stages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for many days he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friend on the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished that theory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructress in which they had from the first almost equally found a convenience it had been he no doubt who had most put it forward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mild pretension but he had again and again repeated to her that he should never without her have been where he was and she had not successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her to believe it even after the question of where he was had begun to show itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation it had never indeed before that evening come up as during the passage at the official party and he had for the first time at those moments a little disappointedly got the impression of a certain failure on the dear womans part of something he was aware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her of what exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps have felt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact as by charlottes observation broken down the details of the collapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to the same thing all such collapses the failure of courage the failure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact for didnt any one of them by itself amount really to the failure of wit which was the last thing he had expected of her and which would be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it had been charlottes remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easy imagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrank from affixing a label to mrs assinghams want of faith but when he thought at his ease of the way persons who were capable really entertained or at least with any refinement the passion of personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neither timorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if need be have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself to that definite degree that he had positively almost missed the luxury of some such call from her that was what it all came back to again with these people among whom he was married that one found one used ones imagination mainly for wondering how they contrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as if there were never anything to do for them that was worthy to call worthy of the personal relation never any charming charge to take of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have put it that one had never to plot or to lie for them he might humourously have put it that one had never as by the higher conformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by all romantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as much as to hate but he could amuse himself with saying so far as the amusement went that they were what he had once for all turned his back on fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square so much he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent least of all at teatime during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practically agreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of these conversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming to be that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field it was finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on the interspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounter the only person from whom he was a little estranged it would have been all prodigious if he had not already with charlottes aid so very considerably lived into it it would have been all indescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causes for it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in the combination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assingham delighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily to reach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew by the same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of her on which affliction would feed it might feed of course on finding her so absent from her home just as this particular phenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxious mind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itself this was appreciable so that she might well after all have no great light on the question of whether charlottes appearances there were frequent or not any more than on that of the account they might be keeping of the usual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fund of explanation for the divisions of mrs ververs day the circumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in charge of the social relations of the family literally of those of the two households as to her genius for representing which in the great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had more and more accumulated it had been established in the two households at an early stage and with the highest goodhumour that charlotte was a was the social success whereas the princess though kind though punctilious though charming though in fact the dearest little creature in the world and the princess into the bargain was distinctly not would distinctly never be and might as well practically give it up whether through being above it or below it too much outside of it or too much lost in it too unequipped or too indisposed didnt especially matter what sufficed was that the whole thing call it appetite or call it patience the act of representation at large and the daily business of intercourse fell in with charlottes tested facility and not much less visibly with her accommodating her generous view of her domestic use she had come frankly into the connection to do and to be what she could no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of a visitinglist that maggie originally left to herself and left even more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately out of hand she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the london treadmill she had handsomely professed herself for the further comfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for a pleasant constitutional curiosity there were possibilities of dulness ponderosities of practice arid social sands the bad quartersofanhour that turned up like false pieces in a debased currency of which she made on principle very nearly as light as if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the prince had on this score paid her his compliment soon after her return from her weddingtour in america where by all accounts she had wondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husbands side everything that came up and what had come often was beyond words just as precisely with her own interest only at stake she had thrown up the game during the visit paid before her marriage the discussion of the american world the comparison of notes impressions and adventures had been all at hand as a ground of meeting for mrs verver and her husbands soninlaw from the hour of the reunion of the two couples thus it had been in short that charlotte could for her friends appreciation so promptly make her point even using expressions from which he let her see at the hour that he drew amusement of his own what could be more simple than ones going through with everything she had asked when its so plain a part of ones contract ive got so much by my marriage for she had never for a moment concealed from him how much she had felt it and was finding it that i should deserve no charity if i stinted my return not to do that to give back on the contrary all one can are just ones decency and ones honour and ones virtue these things henceforth if youre interested to know are my rule of life the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images set up on the wall oh yes since im not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seen her dealing always from month to month from day to day and from one occasion to the other with the duties of a remunerated office her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless all the while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in which her husband and her husbands daughter were lapped it had in fact probably done something more than this it had given them a finer and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease they had brought her in on the crudest expression of it to do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius that they had themselves in consequence renounced it even more than they had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved therefore upon maggie in whose chords and whose province they more naturally lay not less naturally by the same token they included the repair at the hands of the latter young woman of every stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggies bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own great mundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didnt no doubt quite equally provide for that would be to balance just in a manner charlottes very most charming function from the moment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it well that charlotte might be appraised as at last not ineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during the days with which we are actually engaged completed in the princes breast these others these images and ruminations of his leisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and his experience that we have attempted to set in order there they bore him company not insufficiently considering in especial his fuller resources in that line while he worked out to the last lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seek fanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of too marked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his not availing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artless theory of his constitution or of charlottes that might prevail there that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact he had ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite and ultimate and it consorted with common prudence with the simplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their having it together that so strangely and so blessedly made as they put it to each other everything possible what further propped up the case moreover was that the world by still another beautiful perversity of their chance included portland place without including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly be added did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as giving itself a frolic shake send out a score of invitations one of which fitful flights precisely had before easter the effect of disturbing a little our young mans measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought from time to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was of the harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlottes own judgment was always that they were ideally free the proof of which would always be she maintained that everyone they feared they might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathed with smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed in smiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struck amerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still grace of their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence and the brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with the overcoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few evenings before easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably present as guests was a discharge of obligations not insistently incurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note of this almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mildeyed middleaged dinner involving for the most part very bland though very exalted immensely announceable and hierarchically placeable couples and followed without the oppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumental concert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggies anxiety had conferred with charlottes ingenuity and both had supremely revelled as it were in mr ververs solvency the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at the foot of the social ladder and with the colonels wife in spite of her humility of position the prince was more inwardly occupied than with any other person except charlotte he was occupied with charlotte because in the first place she looked so inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else was mature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standard of passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence of emphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially wellmeaningly and perversely to maggie it was not indistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed that his wife too had in perfection her own little character but he wondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itself and this he knew in spite of any desire she entertained to the essential air of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed the very conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well the other things of which her appearance was at any time and in eaton square especially made up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth of occasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower her resemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in the first flushed days after their engagement to a little dancinggirl at rest ever so light of movement but most often panting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench her approximation finally for it was analogy somehow more than identity to the transmitted images of rather neutral and negative propriety that made up in his long line the average of wifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been in sufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggie would no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to some such dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia in miniature a light however broke for him in season and when once it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs ververs vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingent participation a mere hinted or tendered discretion in short of mrs ververs indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood her intenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels were inevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation that burned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindled in each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by no means unbecoming spot the party was her fathers party and its greater or smaller success was a question having for her all the importance of his importance so that sympathy created for her a sort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristled with filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty as possible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair so together as undivided by the marriage of each that the princess il ny avait pas a dire might sit where she liked she would still always in that house be irremediably maggie verver the prince found himself on this occasion so beset with that perception that its natural complement for him would really have been to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something of the same impression in the recorded cases of his having dined with his daughter this backward speculation had it begun to play however would have been easily arrested for it was at present to come over amerigo as never before that his remarkable fatherinlaw was the man in the world least equipped with different appearances for different hours he was simple he was a revelation of simplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted of an appearance at all a question that might verily for a weakness in it have been argued it amused our young man who was taking his pleasure tonight it will be seen in sundry occult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the master of the house consisted of resources possessions facilities and amiabilities amplified by the social legend depended for conveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation no mere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these good people and mr ververs estimable quality was almost wholly in that pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and his eyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high his complexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was not covered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of his table so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtue of some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a force quite as an infant king is the representative of a dynasty in this generalised view of his fatherinlaw intensified tonight but always operative amerigo had now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunion of the two households in england had more and more offered itself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but that had not really ripened and flowered he met the decent family eyes across the table met them afterwards in the musicroom but only to read in them still what he had learned to read during his first months the time of overanxious initiation a kind of apprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixed and absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but it neither lingered nor penetrated and was to the princes fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in the course of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it made sure of the amount and just so from time to time the amount of the prince was made sure he was being thus in renewed instalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bank as a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated to infinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish he himself after all had not fixed it the figure was a conception all of mr ververs own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as tonight had the prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as these quiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed for him by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it was impossible that he should not now and again meet charlottes eyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met her husbands for her as well in all his pulses he felt the conveyed impression it put them it kept them together through the vain show of their separation made the two other faces made the whole lapse of the evening the people the lights the flowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic golden bridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almost vertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law would be the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget and never consciously to wound xx the main interest of these hours for us however will have been in the way the prince continued to know during a particular succession of others separated from the evening in eaton square by a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this was the lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fanny assinghams hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kept their ranged companions in the musicroom moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after a couple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part she was moved by the genius of brahms beyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floated away at the young mans side to such a distance as permitted them to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twenty minutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in the less associated electric glare of one of the empty rooms it was their achieved and as he would have said successful most pleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas it was this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness of the later occasion the later occasion then mere matter of discussion had formed her ground for desiring in a light undertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly but distinctly by the time they were seated together the great question of what it might involve it had come out for him before anything else and so abruptly that this almost needed an explanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you know that theyre not after all going to matcham so that if they dont if at least maggie doesnt you wont i suppose go by yourself it was as i say at matcham where the event had placed him it was at matcham during the easter days that it most befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for its wealth of special significance this passage by which the event had been really a good deal determined he had paid first and last many an english country visit he had learned even from of old to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didnt always enjoy them madly he enjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the good people who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns the trick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inward critical life the determined need which apparently all participant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of his mind that was not engaged at the front his body very constantly was engaged at the front in shooting in riding in golfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadowpaths or round the pocketed corners of billiardtables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridgeplaying of breakfasting lunching teadrinking dining and of the nightly climax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristling tray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversation and expression therefore something of him he often felt at these times was left out it was much more when he was alone or when he was with his own people or when he was say with mrs verver and nobody else that he moved that he talked that he listened that he felt as a congruous whole english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order of some sort something so ornamental as to make his identity not complete ideally without it yet who finding no other such object generally worn should be perpetually and the least bit ruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to his pocket the princes shining star may no doubt having been nothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever the object was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memory and a fine embroidery of thought something had rather momentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minutes with his old friend his present perspective made definitely clear to him that she had plumped out for him her first little lie that took on and he could scarce have said why a sharpness of importance she had never lied to him before if only because it had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of what he would do by which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggies and mr ververs not embracing the proposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly to entertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to the line the other pair so left to themselves might take a desire to avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had become marked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had been obliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason for her appeal while the prince on his side had had not without mercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yet remaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely he had on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if he had picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask if im likely also to back out then because it may make a difference in what you and the colonel decide he had gone as far as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though not having had his impression from any indication offered him by charlotte that the assinghams were really in question for the large matcham party the wonderful thing after this was that the active couple had in the interval managed to inscribe themselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to do her justice he had never before observed fanny to make this last passage of the chapter but proved after all with what success she could work when she would once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed by all the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eaton square once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendid hospitality he found everything for his interpretation for his convenience fall easily enough into place and all the more that mrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his having sought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safe distance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in the same sustained sociability just exactly a touch of that eccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on the imagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed as much as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about together though on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their high conditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiring allowances of the house in question no individual line however freely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both our friends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience of a society so placed that it had only its own sensibility to consider looking as it did well over the heads of all lower growths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite as the easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party to the general alliance what anyone thought of anyone else above all of anyone else with anyone else was a matter incurring in these lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imaged there as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained and tactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage only of aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change of dress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed by a rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate at the sidetable were decently usual it was amusing in such lightness of air that the prince should again present himself only to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure as an embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures but as to whom the legend had grown up that he couldnt bear with the height of his standards and the tone of the company in the way of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritation and depression to which promiscuous visiting even at pompous houses had been found to expose him that was all right the noted working harmony of the clever soninlaw and the charming stepmother so long as the relation was for the effect in question maintained at the proper point between sufficiency and excess what with the noble fairness of the place meanwhile the generous mood of the sunny gusty lusty english april all panting and heaving with impatience or kicking and crying even at moments like some infant hercules who wouldnt be dressed what with these things and the bravery of youth and beauty the insolence of fortune and appetite so diffused among his fellowguests that the poor assinghams in their comparatively marked maturity and their comparatively small splendour were the only approach to a false note in the concert the stir of the air was such for going in a degree to ones head that as a mere matter of exposure almost grotesque in its flagrancy his situation resembled some elaborate practical joke carried out at his expense every voice in the great bright house was a call to the ingenuities and impunities of pleasure every echo was a defiance of difficulty doubt or danger every aspect of the picture a glowing plea for the immediate and as with plenty more to come was another phase of the spell for a world so constituted was governed by a spell that of the smile of the gods and the favour of the powers the only handsome the only gallant in fact the only intelligent acceptance of which was a faith in its guarantees and a high spirit for its chances its demand to that the thing came back was above all for courage and goodhumour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worst had not even in the easiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince so convincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air of mere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order as it spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and a trumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shining british sovereigns which was much to the point in its hand courage and goodhumour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to the point that with amerigo really the innermost effect of all this perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation he compared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute for perception that presided in the bosom of his wife at so contented a view of his conduct and course a state of mind that was positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivated ingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocently persisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion too intense to be kept wholly to himself it wasnt that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to be noticed permitted itself as they said to happen there were only odd moments when the breath of the day as it has been called struck him so full in the face that he broke out with all the hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father moping so far as they ever consented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too in the belief that they knew beautifully what their expert companions were in for they knew it might have appeared in these lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhaps sometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for all peacefully admit that knowledge wasnt one of their needs and that they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it they were good children bless their hearts and the children of good children so that verily the principino himself as less consistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as the ripest genius of the trio the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse with maggie in particular that her imagination was clearly never ruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would have been that her husband or even that her fathers wife should prove to have been made for the long run after the pattern set from so far back to the ververs if one was so made one had certainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if one wasnt one had no business there on the particular terms terms of conformity with the principles of eaton square under which one had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of that resurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to content ourselves with calling his irritation deep in the bosom of this falsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishable sense of a higher and braver propriety there were situations that were ridiculous but that one couldnt yet help as for instance when ones wife chose in the most usual way to make one so precisely here however was the difference it had taken poor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusual yet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lend himself being thrust systematically with another woman and a woman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like and being so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one as idiotic or incapable this was a predicament of which the dignity depended all on ones own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theories as if a galantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceived galantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such a rate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlike innocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps an odd one to resent with violence and he did it also as a man of the world all merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion as much as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could also at least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotte and he were fortunately alike capable wasnt this consensus literally their only way not to be ungracious it was positively as if the measure of their escape from that danger were given by the growth between them during their auspicious visit of an exquisite sense of complicity xxi he found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fanny assingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been a glance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made of it here what would they you know really which overflow would have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhaps even to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friend as a person in whom the element of protest had of late been unmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to her replying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can it be so good for you but quite apart from the small sense the question would have had at the best she appeared already to unite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view as well or at least a partial one of the inner spring of this present comparative humility which was all consistent with the retraction he had practically seen her make after mr ververs last dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort to square her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he would have had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how he both held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just so much as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was out of it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture by just so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her from hour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grossly called of her mistake her mistake had only been after all in her wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in for being as she had made haste for that matter during the very first halfhour at tea to proclaim herself the sole and single frump of the party the scale of everything was so different that all her minor values her quainter graces her little local authority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it was enough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dear fanny assinghams these matters and others would be all now as nought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch in cadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesque for she habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane street whereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible and it all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that she wasnt really watching him ground for which would have been too terribly grave she had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsome trouble for her to take the prince could see it all it wasnt a shade of interference that a goodnatured man would visit on her so he didnt even say when she told him how frumpy she knew herself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes and lips that she now knew her he didnt then say ah see what youve done isnt it rather your own fault he behaved differently altogether eminently distinguished himself for she told him she had never seen him so universally distinguished he yet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse her objective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolute value surrounded her with all the importance of her wit that wit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance was meanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to her she called it only niceness but it brought tears into her eyes had the greatness of a general as well as of a special demonstration she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs verver she understands all she needs to understand she has taken her time but she has at last made it out for herself she sees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with the sense of security most favourable to it she cant of course very well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she cant say in so many words dont think of me for i too must make the best of mine arrange as you can only and live as you must i dont get quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her tone and her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean that she trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take as tender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers so that shes well the prince wound up what you may call practically all right charlotte in fact however to help out his confidence didnt call it anything return as he might to the lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two or three times over spell it out for himself only on the eve of their visits end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the house during the halfhour before dinner this easiest of chances they had already a couple of times arrived at by waiting persistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress and by being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that they might a little later on be among the first to appear in festal array the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushionpatting housemaids were marshalled in and there was a place by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatched instants they could breathe so near to each other that the interval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of the union and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions of bliss they had slow approximations that counted as long caresses the quality of these passages in truth made the spoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young womans tone had even now a certain dryness its very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do why whatever people do when they dont trust let one see they dont but let whom see well let me say to begin with and should you mind that he had a slight show of surprise shouldnt you her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i can imagine myself minding is what you yourself if you dont look out may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that youre afraid im only afraid of you a little at moments he presently returned but i shant let fanny see that it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent of mrs assinghams vision were now a real concern to her and she gave expression to this as she had not even yet done what in the world can she do against us theres not a word that she can breathe shes helpless she cant speak she would be herself the first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow to follow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie she made your marriage the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this after a little as with a smile dim but deep he came on maynt she also be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasnt it for a kind of rectification charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she was prompter still i dont mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and im not speaking of how she may have been concerned for you and me im speaking of how she took in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up today she cant go to them and say its very awkward of course you poor dear things but i was frivolously mistaken he took it in still with his long look at her all the more that she wasnt she was right everythings right he went on and everything will stay so then thats all i say but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even to superfluous lucidity were happy and theyre happy what more does the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want ah my dear said charlotte its not i who say that she need want anything i only say that shes fixed that she must stand exactly where everything has by her own act placed her its you who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her of some injurious alternative something or other we must be prepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strange cold smile we are prepared for anything for everything and as we are practically so she must take us shes condemned to consistency shes doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of her nature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance of her life so that her present professions may even at the best not be sincere may be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gaining time the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slight impatience you keep talking about such things as if they were our affair at all i feel at any rate that ive nothing to do with her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel she must arrange all that for herself its enough for me that shell always be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do it even if we were the idiots and cowards we arent and charlottes face with these words to the mitigation of the slightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as really never yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look for the moment as if she had actually pronounced that word of unpermitted presumption so apt is the countenance as with a finer consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of this particular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seen her friend wince in advance at her use of a word that was already on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him that there were things he could prize forms of fortune he could cherish without at all proportionately liking their names had all this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it she applied it then though her own instinct moved her at the same time to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadnt heretofore by a hairs breadth deviated if it didnt sound so vulgar i should say that were fatally as it were safe pardon the low expression since its what we happen to be were so because they are and theyre so because they cant be anything else from the moment that having originally intervened for them she wouldnt now be able to bear herself if she didnt keep them so thats the way shes inevitably with us said charlotte over her smile we hang essentially together well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together his friend had a shrug a shrug that had a grace cosa volete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt its a case he stood looking at her its a case there cant he said have been many perhaps never never never any other that she smiled i confess i should like to think only ours only ours most probably speriamo to which as after hushed connections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte had already with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance at the clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reach the staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swift look round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent with the spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking up and multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet the question of the social side of the process of repatriation with due presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that he should travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible for the same reasons that he should travel to town save in the conditions that he had for the last twentyfour hours been privately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and this put at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone for disposing of his elder friends suggestion an assumption in fact equally full and mild that he and charlotte would conveniently take the same train and occupy the same compartment as the colonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver had been precisely a part of mrs assinghams mildness and nothing could better have characterised her sense for social shades than her easy perception that the gentleman from portland place and the lady from eaton square might now confess quite without indiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for the four days no direct appeal to the latter personage but the prince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last night of their stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatory talk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poor fanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and the prince love quite apparently without blinking she took for granted their public withdrawal together she remarked that she and bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to take any train that would make them all one party i feel really as if all this time i had seen nothing of you that gave an added grace to the candour of the dear things approach but just then it was on the other hand that the young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing as he preferred his preference had during the evening not failed of occasion to press him with mute insistences practically without words without any sort of straight telegraphy it had arrived at a felt identity with charlottes own she spoke all for their friend while she answered their friends question but she none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she had fluttered a white handkerchief from a window its awfully sweet of you darling our going together would be charming but you mustnt mind us you must suit yourselves weve settled amerigo and i to stay over till after luncheon amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straight away so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the very emotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination may achieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for the same foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as a consequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other and without the passing between them of a word he hadnt god knew to take it from her he was too conscious of what he wanted but the lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlotte could thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding no explanation no touch for plausibility that she wasnt strictly obliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women so situated express and distinguish themselves she had answered mrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and she had above all thrown off for his stretched but covered attention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the face of the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at these moments was in it the measure especially of the thought that had been growing with him a positive obsession and that began to throb as never yet under this brush of her having by perfect parity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousness had by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of an exquisite order at the glow of which she too had so unmistakably then been warming herself the truth that the occasion constituted by the last few days couldnt possibly save by some poverty of their own refuse them some still other and still greater beauty it had already told them with an hourly voice that it had a meaning a meaning that their associated sense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough through the sands and the sight afar of the palmcluster might drink in at last the promised well in the desert there had been beauty day after day and there had been for the spiritual lips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below their fortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to the same height was the idea with which behind and beneath everything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration of which as in that of the sunchequered greenwood of romance his spirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they were already from that moment so handinhand in the place that he found himself making use five minutes later of exactly the same tone as charlottes for telling mrs assingham that he was likewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for what mightnt be this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step further than charlotte put the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostess as a consequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didnt mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasure itself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver and maggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned he even found deliberation to intimate how little he really neglected the first as it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt how little he must remit his effort to make them remark it to which he added with equal lucidity that they would return in time for dinner and if he didnt as a last word subjoin that it would be lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to go to eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on this was not because the impulse down to the very name for the amiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance his general plan had at moments where she was concerned its drops of continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than that she should suspect in him however tempted any element of conscious cheek but he was always that was really the upshot cultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of english race all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she would unfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfully having attained the summit of the wonderful during the brief interval that had separated her appeal to charlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the five minutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditation which showed among several things the impression charlotte had made on her it was from the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though who indeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spoke most really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver of the flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantry of her offer was all sufficient ill go to our friends then ill ask for luncheon ill tell them when to expect you that will be charming say were all right all right precisely i cant say more mrs assingham smiled no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance of it neither can you by what i seem to feel say less oh i wont say less fanny laughed with which the next moment she had turned away but they had it again not less bravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of the advancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think ill send home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy oh i think were easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that were bearing up youre bearing up good and charlotte returns to dinner to dinner were not likely i think to make another night away well then i wish you at least a pleasant day oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best for it after which in due course with the announcement of their conveyance the assinghams rolled off xxii it was quite for the prince after this as if the view had further cleared so that the halfhour during which he strolled on the terrace and smoked the day being lovely overflowed with the plenitude of its particular quality its general brightness was composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out of it as if the whole place and time had been a great picture from the hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for his collection and all varnished and framed to hang up what marked it especially for the highest appreciation was his extraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed and enhanced possession of it poor fanny assinghams challenge amounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while he leaned on the old marble balustrade so like others that he knew in still more noblyterraced italy was that she was squared allconveniently even to herself and that rumbling toward london with this contentment she had become an image irrelevant to the scene it further passed across him as his imagination was for reasons during the time unprecedentedly active that he had after all gained more from women than he had ever lost by them there appeared so more and more on those mystic books that are kept in connection with such commerce even by men of the loosest business habits a balance in his favour that he could pretty well as a rule take for granted what were they doing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine and conspire for his advantage from maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour into whose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on for reasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husbands soninlaw should not wait over in her company he would at least see lady castledean had said that nothing dreadful should happen to her either while still there or during the exposure of the run to town and for that matter if they exceeded a little their license it would positively help them to have done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides in lady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotte herself was working for him without provocation or pressure by the mere play of some vague sense on their part definite and conscious at the most only in charlotte that he was not as a nature as a character as a gentleman in fine below his remarkable fortune but there were more things before him than even these things that melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his sense of beauty if the outlook was in every way spacious and the towers of three cathedrals in different counties as had been pointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in the rich sameness of tone didnt he somehow the more feel it so because precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of her own and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as the note of the day it made everything fit above all it diverted him to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because she wished to detain mr blint and she couldnt detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreading over the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up to london the place was all her own she had had a fancy for a quiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished young man distinctly younger than her ladyship who played and sang delightfully played even bridge and sang the englishcomic as well as the frenchtragic and the presence which really meant the absence of a couple of other friends if they were happily chosen would make everything all right the prince had the sense all goodhumouredly of being happily chosen and it was not spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in its train and with which during his life in england he had more than once had reflectively to deal the state of being reminded how after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mere representative husband and soninlaw he was so irrelevant to the working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to uses comparatively trivial no other of her guests would have been thus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothlyworking man each in his way a lubricated item of the great social political administrative engrenage claimed most of all castledean himself who was so very oddly given the personage and the type rather a large item if he on the other hand had an affair it was not of that order it was of the order verily that he had been reduced to as a not quite glorious substitute it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that this vision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measure of his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the so familiar fact of his sacrifices down to the idea of the very relinquishment for his wifes convenience of his real situation in the world with the consequence thus that he was in the last analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this was sensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise above it a spirit that positively played with the facts with all of them from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations to that of his having in mind something quite beautiful and independent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldnt somehow take mr blint seriously he was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to be in abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such a woman as lady castledean could take him since this question but sank for him again into the fathomless depths of english equivocation he knew them all as was said well he had lived with them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done various other things with them but the number of questions about them he couldnt have answered had much rather grown than shrunken so that experience struck him for the most part as having left in him but one residual impression they didnt like les situations nettes that was all he was very sure of they wouldnt have them at any price it had been their national genius and their national success to avoid them at every point they called it themselves with complacency their wonderful spirit of compromise the very influence of which actually so hung about him here from moment to moment that the earth and the air the light and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky the bluegreen counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it every accent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence of such a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now for that seated solidity in the rich seamist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes but it was at the same time precisely why even much initiation left one at given moments so puzzled as to the element of staleness in all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness of innocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there were other marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on which he would have known what to think and would have enjoyed thereby at least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relation between a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiring mind in these present conditions might it was true be more sharply challenged but the result of its attention and its ingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to be confronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmed bewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in the relation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but its very most direct bearings lady castledeans dream of mr blint for the morning was doubtless already with all the spacious harmonies reestablished taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that were consecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished had been effected her convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte was since he didnt at all suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be to have accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of their companions the upshot of everything for him alike of the less and of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like a large fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was to charlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved along the terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of the house he looked up at all the windows that were open to the april morning and wondered which of them would represent his friends room it befell thus that his question after no long time was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she had been called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had come to the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remained there a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struck with her wearing a hat and a jacket which conduced to her appearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautiful uncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with him some larger step altogether the larger step had been since the evening before intensely in his own mind though he had not fully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak the definite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it for herself they had these identities of impulse they had had them repeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encounters gave the measure of the degree in which people were in the common phrase meant for each other no union in the world had ever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most often happened was that her rightness went as who should say even further than his own they were conscious of the same necessity at the same moment only it was she as a general thing who most clearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him now out of the old grey window something in the very poise of her hat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of her smile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of the fact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluck it on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minute mean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between them that their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding it fast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it to praise he broke however after a moment the silence it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be a serenade ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its company with another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watched him place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said in an italian not loud but deep vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out and she had left him the next minute to wait for her he came along the terrace again with pauses during which his eyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darker wash of faraway watercolour that represented the most distant of the cathedral towns this place with its great church and its high accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledged interest this place had sounded its name to him half the night through and its name had become but another name the pronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense of things which now throbbed within him he had kept saying to himself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if the sharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intensely expressed in it that meaning was really that his situation remained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that they absolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the very lustre of this truth every present circumstance helped to proclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of the morning he knew why from the first of his marriage he had tried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he had given up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he at any rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis of his having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette it had all been just in order that his well what on earth should he call it but his freedom should at present be as perfect and rounded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadnt struggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been given him the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality and rarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him in silence while he moved to meet her the great scale of this particular front at matcham multiplied thus in the golden morning the stages of their meeting and the successions of their consciousness it wasnt till she had come quite close that he produced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there she knew just where to look yes isnt it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with their depths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some old king we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed to give him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a great gold cup that we must somehow drain together i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as you do so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do you remember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautiful one the real one that i offered you so long ago and that you wouldnt have just before your marriage she brought it back to him the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop oh yes but it took with a slight surprise on the princes part some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing you wanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew who understood italian and who backed you up but i feel this an occasion he immediately added and i hope you dont mean he smiled that as an occasion its also cracked they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as they were though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows but it made each find in the others voice a taste as of something slowly and deeply absorbed dont you think too much of cracks and arent you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and ive often recalled the bowl and the little swindling jew wondering if theyve parted company he made she said a great impression on me well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and i dare say that if you were to go back to him youd find he has been keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the prince went on what did you tell me the other day you prettily call them in englishrifts within the lute risk them as much as you like for yourself but dont risk them for me he spoke it in all the gaiety of his just barelytremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and thats why he said i know where we are theyre every one today on our side resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent a little and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed i go but by one thing her hand was on the sunwarmed stone so that turned as they were away from the house he put his own upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go by you so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesture that matched what is really our great necessity you know is to go by my watch its already eleven he had looked at the time so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of our afternoon to this charlottes eyes opened straight theres not the slightest need of our stopping here to luncheon dont you see she asked how im ready he had taken it in but there was always more and more of her you mean youve arranged its easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things youve only to speak to your man about yours and they can go together you mean we can leave at once she let him have it all one of the carriages about which i spoke will already have come back for us if your superstitions are on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and ill back my support against yours then you had thought he wondered about gloucester she hesitated but it was only her way i thought you would think we have thank goodness these harmonies they are food for superstition if you like its beautiful she went on that it should be gloucester gloster gloster as you say making it sound like an old song however im sure gloster gloster will be charming she still added we shall be able easily to lunch there and with our luggage and our servants off our hands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it all out and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciation expand then lady castledean doesnt dream of our staying he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himself was free have i positively to tell you that she doesnt want us she only wanted us for the others to show she wasnt left alone with him now that thats done and that theyve all gone she of course knows for herself knows the prince vaguely echoed why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to see them or go round to take them in whenever weve a chance that its what our respective families quite expect of us and would be disappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs verver pursued would be our pull if our pull werent indeed so great all round he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out the very train the very one paddington the in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will of course be in eaton square i hereby invite you for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before he spoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in a moment added but the train for gloucester a local one with several stops but doing it a good deal i forget how much within the hour so that weve time only she said we must employ our time he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her he looked again at his watch while they moved back to the door through which she had advanced but he had also again questions and stops all as for the mystery and the charm you looked it up without my having asked you ah my dear she laughed ive seen you with bradshaw it takes anglosaxon blood blood he echoed youve that of every race it kept her before him youre terrible well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn what is it then there are two youll see but ive chosen the right one and i think i remember the tomb she smiled oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i had been keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you already were with it you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how do you make out she asked that you were keeping it from me i dont now how shall i ever keep anything some day when i shall wish to ah for things i maynt want to know i promise you shall find me stupid they had reached their door where she herself paused to explain these days yesterday last night this morning ive wanted everything well it was all right you shall have everything xxiii fanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing her maid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of their effects the result of this for each of the pair was a state of occupation so unbroken that the day practically passed without fresh contact between them they dined out together but it was both in going to their dinner and in coming back that they appeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny was wrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemoncoloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and her husband with her silence to deal with showed himself not less disposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he would have said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latter they found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the first floor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside the drawingroom into a great gilded venetian chair of which at first however she but made with her brooding face a sort of throne of meditation she would thus have recalled a little with her so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechless sphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel not unlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping at the foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance into the drawingroom he visited according to his wont the windows and their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all at once of the master and the manager the commandant and the ratepayer then he came back to his wife before whom for a moment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continued to wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in these minor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of a suspension of their old custom of divergent discussion that intercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at present to be vulgarly recognised as clear there might for that matter even have been in mr assinghams face a mild perception of some finer sense a sense for his wifes situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiate that she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was very much what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that she had given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eaton square and that her doing so would have been but the prompt result of impressions gathered in quantities in brimming baskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham a process surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on with abstentions and discretions that might almost have counted as solemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed him to nothing to nothing beyond this confession itself of a consciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been his keeping her even if without a word well in sight he had not quitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of the mystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where she could signal to him at need her need would have arisen if the planks of her bark had parted then some sort of plunge would have become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didnt perhaps mean that her planks were now parting he held himself so ready that it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat and waistcoat before he had plunged however that is before he had uttered a question he perceived not without relief that she was making for land he watched her steadily paddle always a little nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump was distinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong theres nothing nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasy but im satisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken theres nothing but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what you did persistently asseverate youve guaranteed their straightness from the first no ive never till now guaranteed anything but my own disposition to worry ive never till now fanny went on gravely from her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had it at that place if i had in my infatuation and my folly she added with expression nothing else so i did see i have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made her head in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know the colonel took it but took it at first in silence do you mean theyve told you no i mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i havent asked them and in the second their word in such a matter wouldnt count oh said the colonel with all his oddity theyd tell us it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of his short cuts always across her finest flowerbeds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when theyve told you youll be perhaps so good as to let me know he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with the back of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah i dont say that theyd necessarily tell me that they are over the traces theyll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues i hope and im talking of them now as i take them for myself only thats enough for me its all i have to regard with which after an instant theyre wonderful said fanny assingham indeed her husband concurred i really think they are youd think it still more if you knew but you dont know because you dont see their situation this was what he didnt see is too extraordinary too he was willing to try too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didnt see but just that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously he followed at his own pace their situation the incredible side of it they make it credible credible then you do say to you she looked at him again for an interval they believe in it themselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them but if what it is is just their chance its their chance for what i told you when charlotte first turned up its their chance for the idea that i was then sure she had the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea at different moments of any one of their ideas this dim procession visibly mustered before him and with the best will in the world he could but watch its immensity are you speaking now of something to which you can comfortably settle down again for a little she only glowered at him ive come back to my belief and that i have done so well he asked as she paused well shows that im right for i assure you i had wandered far now im at home again and i mean said fanny assingham to stay here theyre beautiful she declared the prince and charlotte the prince and charlotte thats how theyre so remarkable and the beauty she explained is that theyre afraid for them afraid i mean for the others for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraid of what afraid of themselves the colonel wondered of themselves of mr ververs and maggies selves mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yes of such blindness too but most of all of their own danger he turned it over that danger being the blindness that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elements i neednt at this time of day attempt to tell you it contains luckily for thats the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husbands he stood for a moment he would have it straight whose husbands mr ververs she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feel that they see but its also his wifes whose wifes he asked as she continued to gloom at him in a manner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the princes maggies own maggies very own she pursued as for herself he had a pause do you think maggie so blind the question isnt of what i think the questions of the conviction that guides the prince and charlotte who have better opportunities than i for judging the colonel again wondered are you so very sure their opportunities are better well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinary situation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity ah my dear you have that opportunity of their extraordinary situation and relation as much as they with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i see the boat theyre in but im not thank god in it myself today however mrs assingham added today in eaton square i did see well then what but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing for them i mean for the others it was as if something had happened i dont know what except some effect of these days with them at that place that had either made things come out or had cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor ladys rested on her companions meanwhile with the lustre not so much of intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had at various other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple of large candid gathering glittering tears to emphasise the fact they had immediately for him their usual direct action she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely in her own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as he should be able to make it out the only thing was that it took such incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkable for instance as she developed her indication of what had come out in the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever what makes them what makes them he pressed her as she fitfully dropped well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do it might well have been difficult to know how to take it and they may even say for themselves that they were a long time trying to see as i say today she went on it was as if i were suddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through their eyes on which as to shake off her perversity fanny assingham sprang up but she remained there under the dim illumination and while the colonel with his high dry spare look of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness of inaccessible snows in his necktie shirtfront and waistcoat gave a rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the late hour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldly adventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grim midnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention moved mechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely on the walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition for the time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imagine the way it works she said its so easy to understand yet i dont want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i dont i dont want to be wrong to make a mistake you mean oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well what she meant i dont make mistakes but i perpetrate in thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity im a most dreadful person there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what ive done or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feel that id do it again feel that id do things myself ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for you you never have youve done every thing else but youve never done that but what i really dont a bit want she declared is to abet them or to protect them her companion turned this over what is there to protect them from if by your now so settled faith theyve done nothing that justly exposes them and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing she waited again it isnt my whole idea nothing is my whole idea for i felt today as i tell you that theres so much in the air oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed well whats in the air always has hasnt it to come down to the earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a very curious little person since i was in this afternoon for seeing more than i had ever done well i felt that too for some reason as i hadnt yet felt it for some reason for what reason and then as his wife at first said nothing did she give any sign was she in any way different shes always so different from anyone else in the world that its hard to say when shes different from herself but she has made me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home home here first to portland place on her leaving her father since she does once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her a little longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the same purpose then she went home though i had brought her a message from the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he and charlotte must have arrived if they have arrived expecting to drive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinner there she has everything there you know she has clothes the colonel didnt in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change twenty changes if you like all sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her father and she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his house very much as she had it before she was married and just as the boy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble when she comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bien that if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish a friend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce able to put them up it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the child spread so maggie and the child spread so well he considered it is rather rum thats all i claim she seemed thankful for the word i dont say its anything more but it is distinctly rum which after an instant the colonel took up more what more could it be it could be that shes unhappy and that she takes her funny little way of consoling herself for if she were unhappy mrs assingham had figured it out thats just the way im convinced she would take but how can she be unhappy since as im also convinced she in the midst of everything adores her husband as much as ever the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if shes so happy please whats the matter it made his wife almost spring at him you think then shes secretly wretched but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i give them up to you ive nothing more to suggest then its not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he were frequently sweet you admit that it is rum and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention has charlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends never that i know of a word it isnt the sort of thing she does and whom has she after all mrs assingham added to complain to hasnt she always you oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of a chapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikes me more and more as extraordinary a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into the colonels face if theyre each and all so extraordinary then isnt that why one must just resign ones self to wash ones hands of them to be lost her face however so met the question as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that their trouble had now become too real for her charged eyes so betrayed the condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plain mans vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasnt she then charlotte always her husband to complain to shed rather die oh and bob assinghams face at the vision of such extremities lengthened for very docility hasnt she the prince then for such matters oh he doesnt count i thought that was just what as the basis of our agitation he does do mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit as a person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs ververs superiority to any such mistake she gave characteristically something like a toss of her head as marked a tribute to that ladys general grace in all the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless had ever received ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short low gurgle but it found his wife again prepared no not only maggie a great many people in london and small wonder bore him maggie only worst then but it was a question that he had promptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which she had shortly before sown the seed you said just now that he would by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really wont have returned his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of her responsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep her from entertaining it i think theres nothing theyre not now capable of in their so intense good faith good faith he echoed the words which had in fact something of an odd ring critically their false position it comes to the same thing and she bore down with her decision the superficial lack of sequence they may very possibly for a demonstration as i see them not have come back he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may have bolted somewhere together may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may have wired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotion which at the pressure of some spring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever theyve done i shall never know never never because i dont want to and because nothing will induce me so they may do as they like but ive worked for them all she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver and the next moment her tears had come though she had with the explosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him she passed into the dusky drawingroom where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light of the streetlamps came in a little at the window she made for this window against which she leaned her head while the colonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minute and hesitated he might have been wondering what she had really done to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception in the affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough too much for him he had known her at other times quite not try not to and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his arm round her he drew her head to his breast where while she gasped she let it stay a little all with a patience that presently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddly enough was not to close their colloquy with the natural result of sending them to bed what was between them had opened out further had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without more words the region of the understood shutting the door after it and bringing them so still more nearly face to face they remained for some minutes looking at it through the dim window which opened upon the world of human trouble in general and which let the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal and colour the florid features looming dimly of fannys drawingroom and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with his wonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments of their silence above all which might have represented their sinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lake where he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddle alone the beauty of it was that they now could really talk better than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutely exacted but that charlotte and the prince must be saved so far as consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fannys troubled mind for that was the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now at all events by refusing her no gentleness that he had sufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to what she had told him of her recent passage with maggie i dont altogether see you know what you infer from it or why you infer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as if in possession of what they had brought up from the depths xxiv i cant say more this made his companion reply than that something in her face her voice and her whole manner acted upon me as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for the reason above all that i felt her trying her very best and her very best poor duck is very good to be quiet and natural its when one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for it then it is that one knows somethings the matter i cant describe my impression you would have had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be the matter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning to doubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world it was impressive fannys vision and the colonel as if himself agitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt of fidelity to doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will go hard with her but shell put it all he concluded on charlotte mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with a headshake she wont put it anywhere she wont do with it anything anyone else would shell take it all herself you mean shell make it out her own fault yes shell find means somehow to arrive at that ah then the colonel dutifully declared shes indeed a little brick oh his wife returned youll see in one way or another to what tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach to elation so that as if immediately feeling his surprise she turned round to him shell see me somehow through see you yes me im the worst for said fanny assingham now with a harder exaltation i did it all i recognise that i accept it she wont cast it up at me she wont cast up anything so i throw myself upon her shell bear me up she spoke almost volubly she held him with her sudden sharpness shell carry the whole weight of us there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she wont mind i say love and he not unkindly stared then wheres the difficulty there isnt any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at her longer ah you mean there isnt any for us she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too much imputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their own surface then she might have been deciding that their own surface was after all what they had most to consider not she said with dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared even to signify that they would begin by keeping them now this was what it was to have at last a constituted basis do you remember what you said to me that night of my first real anxiety after the foreign office party in the carriage as we came home yes he could recall it leave them to pull through precisely trust their own wit you practically said to save all appearances well ive trusted it i have left them to pull through he hesitated and your point is that theyre not doing so ive left them she went on but now i see how and where ive been leaving them all the while without knowing it to her to the princess and thats what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued thats what happened to me with her today she continued to explain it came home to me that thats what ive really been doing oh i see i neednt torment myself she has taken them over the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this he a little sightlessly stared but what then has happened from one day to the other to her what has opened her eyes they were never really shut she misses him then why hasnt she missed him before well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she did but she wouldnt let herself know it she had her reason she wore her blind now at last her situation has come to a head today she does know it and thats illuminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attention was vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl ah no dont pity her this did however pull him up we maynt even be sorry for her not now or at least not yet its too soon that is if it isnt very much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her before for all the good it would then have done her we might have begun some time ago now however she has begun to live and the way it comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projected her vision the way it comes to you can scarcely be that shell like it the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comes to me is that shell triumph she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairly cheered her husband ah then we must back her no we mustnt touch her we maynt touch any of them we must keep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watch and wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear it as we can thats where we are and serves us right were in presence and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowy portents she left it till he questioned again in presence of what well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may come off she had paused there before him while he wondered you mean shell get the prince back she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion might have been almost abject it isnt a question of recovery it wont be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back she must have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be waking up to is the truth that all the while she really hasnt had him never ah my dear the poor colonel panted never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do you remember what i said to you long ago that evening just before their marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to be feared robust what havent you love said in your time so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my having once or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at all events than when i put it to you that evening that maggie was the person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least be communicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almost cheerfully as if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or a lunatic to the very very wrong but his wifes spirit after its effort of wing was able to remain higher to whats called evil with a very big e for the first time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledge of it to the crude experience of it and she gave for the possibility the largest measure to the harsh bewildering brush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeed and here mrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far as she has come and if she comes no further simply to the suspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that mere dose of alarm will prove enough he considered but enough for what then dear if not enough to break her heart enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddly replied to give her i mean the right one the right one wont break her heart it will make her she explained well it will make her by way of a change understand one or two things in the world but isnt it a pity the colonel asked that they should happen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable to her oh disagreeable theyll have had to be disagreeable to show her a little where she is theyll have had to be disagreeable to make her sit up theyll have had to be disagreeable to make her decide to live bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowly revolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and he seemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had at the same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at last attained and it was doubtless by way of expression of this teachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as from the force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he had thought of the response his wifes words ideally implied decide to live ah yes for her child oh bother her child and he had never felt so snubbed for an exemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live you poor dear for her father which is another pair of sleeves and mrs assinghams whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling to glow any idiot can do things for her child shell have a motive more original and we shall see how it will work her shell have to save him to save him to keep her father from her own knowledge that and she seemed to see it before her in her husbands very eyes will be work cut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax she wound up their colloquy good night there was something in her manner however or in the effect at least of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by a single touch lifted him to her side so that after she had turned her back to regain the landing and the staircase he overtook her before she had begun to mount with the ring of excited perception ah but you know thats rather jolly jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of the staircase i mean its rather charming charming it had still to be their law a little that she was tragic when he was comic i mean its rather beautiful you just said yourself it would be only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connections hitherto dim only i dont quite see why that very care for him which has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affect one as so rum hasnt also by the same stroke made her notice a little more what has been going on ah there you are its the question that ive all along been asking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but she raised them as she pursued she let him have it straight and its the question of an idiot an idiot well the idiot that ive been in all sorts of ways so often of late have i asked it youre excusable since you ask it but now the answer i saw today has all the while been staring me in the face then what in the world is it why the very intensity of her conscience about him the very passion of her brave little piety thats the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum a way as possible but it has been working from a rum start from the moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and it then happened by an extraordinary perversity that the very opposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of this fatality however she could give but a desperate shrug i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rum start but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed to make her sense for a moment intolerable yes there i am i was really at the bottom of it she declared i dont know what possessed me but i planned for him i goaded him on with which however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed me for wasnt he beset with ravening women right and left and didnt he quite pathetically appeal for protection didnt he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidly continued couldnt with a new life of her own give herself up to doing for him in the future all she had done in the past to fencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off one perceived this she went on out of the abundance of ones affection and ones sympathy it all blessedly came back to her when it wasnt all for the fiftieth time obscured in face of the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was no doubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one sees peoples lives for them better than they see them for themselves but ones excuse here she insisted was that these people clearly didnt see them for themselves didnt see them at all it struck one for very pity that they were making a mess of such charming material that they were but wasting it and letting it go they didnt know how to live and somehow one couldnt if one took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it thats what i pay for and the poor woman in straighter communion with her companions intelligence at this moment she appeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have the whole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessary interest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fix itself also on charlotte charlotte who was hovering there on the edge of our lives when not beautifully and a trifle mysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of waste and a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible good to the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come over me in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person who could keep off ravening women without being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there was something of course that might have stopped me you know you know what i mean it looks at me she veritably moaned out of your face but all i can say is that it didnt the reason largely being once i had fallen in love with the beautiful symmetry of my plan that i seemed to feel sure maggie would accept charlotte whereas i didnt quite make out either what other woman or what other kind of woman one could think of her accepting i see i see she had paused meeting all the while his listening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen with her talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands my dear it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helpless ignorance yes dearest and the grimness of her dreariness suddenly once more possessed her youve only to tell me that that knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffable headshake that i dont stand up im down down down she declared yet she as quickly added theres just one little thing that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting but an instant they might easily they would perhaps even certainly have done something worse he thought worse than that charlotte ah dont tell me she cried that there could have been nothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary he was almost simultaneous extraordinary she observes the forms said fanny assingham he hesitated with the prince for the prince and with the others she went on with mr verver wonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justice are twothirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldnt say it for the world say she none the less pursued he had married a woman the prince would really have cared for you mean then he doesnt care for charlotte this was still a new view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to make sure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no then what on earth are they up to still however she only looked at him so that standing there before her with his hands in his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak of that are twothirds of conduct what will be keeping her now by your hypothesis from coming home with him till morning yes absolutely their forms theirs maggies and mr ververs those they impose on charlotte and the prince those she developed that so perversely as i say have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones he considered but only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i dont understand the state of things existing hasnt grown like a field of mushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in for now is at least the consequence of what theyve done are they mere helpless victims of fate well fanny at last had the courage of it yes they are to be so abjectly innocent that is to be victims of fate and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they were as much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the princes and charlottes were beautiful of that i had my faith they were id go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been a wretch and ive not been a wretch ive only been a doubledyed donkey ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to have been well too much taken up with considering each other you may call such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it at any rate means all round their case it illustrates the misfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too too charming this was another matter that took some following but the colonel again did his best yes but to whom doesnt it rather depend on that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been too charming to each other in the first place obviously and then both of them together to maggie to maggie he wonderingly echoed to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted from the first so guilelessly yes so guilelessly themselves her guileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life then isnt one supposed in common humanity and if one hasnt quarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesnt drink or kick up rows isnt one supposed to keep ones aged parent in ones life certainly when there arent particular reasons against it that there may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moral of what is before us in the first place mr verver isnt aged the colonel just hung fire but it came then why the deuce does he oh poor dear man behave as if he were she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isnt my whole point that hes charming to her doesnt it depend a bit on what she regards as charming she faced the question as if it were flippant then with a headshake of dignity she brushed it away its mr verver whos really young its charlotte whos really old and what i was saying she added isnt affected you were saying he did her the justice that theyre all guileless that they were guileless all at first quite extraordinarily its what i mean by their failure to see that the more they took for granted they could work together the more they were really working apart for i repeat fanny went on that i really believe charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up their minds originally that their very esteem for mr verver which was serious as well it might be would save them i see the colonel inclined himself and save him it comes to the same thing then save maggie that comes said mrs assingham to something a little different for maggie has done the most he wondered what do you call the most well she did it originally she began the vicious circle for that though you make round eyes at my associating her with vice is simply what it has been its their mutual consideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and theyre really so embroiled but because in their way theyve been so improbably good in their way yes the colonel grinned which was above all maggies way no flicker of his ribaldry was anything to her now maggie had in the first place to make up to her father for her having suffered herself to become poor little dear as she believed so intensely married then she had to make up to her husband for taking so much of the time they might otherwise have spent together to make this reparation to mr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was by allowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may call it of charlotte to cheer his path by instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was all right might be missed from his side by so much at the same time however mrs assingham further explained by so much as she took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as something again to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligation created and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him that his marriage could never under whatever temptation of her own bliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting or neglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting to show the prince that she recognised how the other desire this wish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughter she had always been involved in some degree and just for the present so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quite hold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that a person can mostly feel but one passion one tender passion that is at a time only that doesnt hold good for our primary and instinctive attachments the voice of blood such as ones feeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense and yet not prevent other intensities as you will recognise my dear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adore my mother whom you didnt adore for years after i had begun to adore you well maggie she kept it up is in the same situation as i was plus complications from which i was thank heaven exempt plus the complication above all of not having in the least begun with the sense for complications that i should have had before she knew it at any rate her little scruples and her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i say had brought the two others together as her grossest misconduct couldnt have done and now she knows something or other has happened yet hasnt heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor child something that she has earnestly but confusedly seen as her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top of the remedy that she at first thought out for herself and that would really have needed since then so much modification her only modification has been the growth of her necessity to prevent her fathers wondering if all in their life in common may be so certainly for the best she has now as never before to keep him unconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as their situation is theres anything in it all uncomfortable or disagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she has to keep touching it up to make it each day each month look natural and normal to him so that god forgive me the comparison shes like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greater audacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrown off i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudent learning to be so to gloss things over she could she even will yet i believe learn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see its all rouge she paused staring at the vision it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as it but made her look at him hard however he amended the form of his inquiry you mean that in that case she will charming creature be lost she was silent a moment more as ive told you before she wont be lost if her fathers saved shell see that as salvation enough the colonel took it in then shes a little heroine rather shes a little heroine but its his innocence above all mrs assingham added that will pull them through her companion at this focussed again mr ververs innocence its awfully quaint of course its awfully quaint that its awfully quaint that the pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear old quaintness by which i dont mean yours and mine but that of my own sweet countrypeople from whom ive so deplorably degenerated that mrs assingham declared was originally the head and front of their appeal to me and of my interest in them and of course i shall feel them quainter still she rather ruefully subjoined before theyve done with me this might be but it wasnt what most stood in the colonels way you believe so in mr ververs innocence after two years of charlotte she stared but the whole point is just that two years of charlotte are what he hasnt really or what you may call undividedly had any more than maggie by your theory eh has really or undividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasnt had the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that in her too so leaves us in admiration so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes a great many things to account for maggie what is definite at all events is that strange though this be her effort for her father has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of their relation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbugged the principino in whom he delights always aiding he has safely and serenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass for those he had sublimely projected he hadnt worked them out in detail any more than i had heaven pity me and the queerness has been exactly in the detail this for him is what it was to have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help both i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem to him all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part not less and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minute across it and what does the prince work like she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breaking short off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated back in which in odd places controlling the complications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet the turquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the wit that pinned together the satin patches of her argument he watched her as if she left him positively under the impression of her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of the drama before them was but that he had when it came to the tight places of life as life had shrunk for him now the most luminous of wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presided over their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as the billows of her amber train allowed making out how all the clearness they had conquered was even for herself a relief how at last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustained and floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light he found she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguish in him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean some minutes ago by his not caring for charlotte the princes by his not really caring she recalled after a little benevolently enough i mean that men dont when it has all been too easy thats how in nine cases out of ten a woman is treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how he works she added but you might better perhaps have asked me how he plays well he made it up like a prince like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she said with expression hes beautifully a case theyre far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to be and thats what makes so much of his value hes perhaps one of the very last the last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round the colonel considered and how must charlotte if anything happens take him the question held her a minute and while she waited with her eyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the flesh of which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thus she gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everything will happen nothing has happened nothing is happening he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wished him to understand it we know nothing on earth it was an undertaking he must sign so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth it was like the soldiers watchword at night were as innocent she went on in the same way as babes why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselves are oh for the best of reasons because were much more so he wondered but how can we be more for them oh easily we can be anything absolute idiots then absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will rest us well he looked as if there were something in that but wont they know were not she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in our intelligence but he doesnt matter and maggie doesnt she know that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it shell give no sign so it comes to the same thing he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to help her thats the way we shall help her by looking like fools she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like a bigger so there we are with which she brushed it away his conformity was promised something however still held her it broke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she added what you were asking me how i knew today in eaton square that maggies awake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing them together seeing her with her father he fell behind again but youve seen her often enough before never with my present eyes for nothing like such a test that of this length of the others absence together has hitherto occurred possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it why is it such a test because it has become one without their intending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands it has soured eh the colonel said the words horrible say rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear in that case she has seen only it was she alone who about the visit insisted her father insists on nothing and she watches him do it her husband looked impressed watches him for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesnt as i tell you come but shes there for it to see and i felt she continued how shes there i caught her as it were in the fact she couldnt keep it from me though she left her post on purpose came home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took it all her dust but it was what showed me with which supreme lucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed me also how she has succeeded nothing from him has come youre so awfully sure sure nothing will goodnight she said shell die first
