unmistakable signs of discouragement i was therefore greatly relieved when in the most desolate part of the road i espied rising before me the dim outlines of a house and was correspondingly disappointed when upon riding forward i perceived that it was but a deserted ruin i was approaching whose fallen chimneys and broken windows betrayed a dilapidation so great that i could scarcely hope to find so much as a temporary shelter therein nevertheless i was so tired of the biting storm that i involuntarily stopped before the decayed and forbidding structure and was in truth withdrawing my foot from the stirrup when i heard an unexpected exclamation behind me and turning saw a chaise from the open front of which leaned a gentleman of most attractive appearance what are you going to do he asked hide my head from the storm was my hurried rejoinder i am tired and so is my horse and the town according to all appearances must be at least two miles distant no matter if it is three miles you must not take shelter in that charnelhouse he muttered and moved along in his seat as if to show me there was room beside him why i exclaimed struck with sudden curiosity is this one of the haunted houses we hear of if so i shall certainly enter and be much obliged to the storm for driving me into so interesting a spot i thought he looked embarrassed at all events i am sure he hesitated for a moment whether or not to ride on and leave me to my fate but his better impulses seemed to prevail for he suddenly cried get in with me and leave mysteries alone if you want to come back here after you have learned the history of that house you can do so but first ride on to town and have a good meal your horse will follow easily enough after he is rid of your weight it was too tempting an offer to be refused so thankfully accepting his kindness i alighted from my horse and after tying him to the back of the chaise got in with this genial stranger as i did so i caught another view of the ruin i had been so near entering good gracious i exclaimed pointing to the structure that with its projecting upper story and ghastly apertures presented a most suggestive appearance if it does not look like a skull my companion shrugged his shoulders but did not reply the comparison was evidently not a new one to him that evening in a comfortable inn parlor i read the following manuscript it was placed in my hands by this kindly stranger who in so doing explained that it had been written by the last occupant of the old inn i was so nearly on the point of investigating she had been its former landlady and had clung to the ancient house long after decay had settled upon its doorstep and desolation breathed from its gaping windows she died in its north room and from under her pillow the discolored leaves were taken the words of which i now place before you january i do not understand myself i do not understand my doubts nor can i analyze my fears when i saw the carriage drive off followed by the wagon with its inexplicable big box i thought i should certainly regain my former serenity but i am more uneasy than ever i cannot rest and keep going over and over in my mind the few words that passed between us in their short stay under my roof it is her face that haunts me it must be that for it had a strange look of trouble in it as well as sickness but neither can i forget his so fair so merry and yet so unpleasant especially when he glanced at her and as i could not help but think before they went away when he glanced at me i do not like him and the chills creep over me whenever i remember his laugh which was much too frequent to be decent considering how poorly his young wife looked they are gone and their belongings with them but i am as much afraid as if they were still here why that is what i cannot tell i sit in the room where they slept and feel as strange and terrified as if i had encountered a ghost there i dread to stay and dread to move and write because i must relieve myself in some way that is if i am to have any sleep tonight am i ill or was there something unexplained and mysterious in their actions let me go over the past and see they came last evening about twilight i was in the front of the house and seeing such a goodlooking couple in the carriage and such a pile of baggage with them that they had to have an extra wagon to carry it i ran out in all haste to welcome them she had a veil drawn over her face and it was so thick that i could not see her features but her figure was slight and graceful and i took a fancy to her at once perhaps because she held her arms out when she saw me as if she thought she beheld in me a friend he did not please me so well though there is no gainsaying that he is handsome enough and speaks when he wishes to with a great deal of courtesy but i thought he ought to give his attention to his young and ailing wife instead of being so concerned about his baggage had that big box of his contained gold he could not have looked at it more lovingly or been more anxious about its handling he said it held books but pshaw what is there in books that a man should love them better than his wife and watch over their welfare with the utmost concern while allowing a stranger to help her out of the carriage and up the inn steps but i will not dwell any longer upon this men are strange beings and must not be judged by rules that apply to women let me see if i can remember when it was that i first saw her face ah yes it was in the parlor she had taken a seat there while her husband looked through the house and decided which room to take there were four empty and two of them were the choicest and airiest in the inn but he passed by these and insisted upon taking one that was stuffy with disuse because it was on the ground floor and so convenient for us to bring his great box into his great box i was so provoked at this everlasting concern about his great box that i ran to the parlor intending to ask the lady herself to interfere but when i got to the threshold i paused and did not speak for the lady or mrs urquhart as i presently found she called herself had risen from her seat and was looking in the glass with an expression so sad and searching that i forgot my errand and only thought of comforting her but the moment she heard my step she drew down the veil which she had tossed back and coming quickly toward me asked if her husband had chosen a room i answered in the affirmative and began to complain that it was not a very cheerful one but she paid small attention to my words and presently i found myself following her to the apartment designated she entered making a picture as she crossed the threshold which i shall not readily forget for in her short quick walk down the hall she had torn the bonnet from her head and though she was not a strictly beautiful woman she was sufficiently interesting to make her every movement attractive but that is not all for some reason the moment possessed an importance for her which i could not measure i saw it in her posture in the pallor of her cheeks and the uprightness of her carriage the sudden halt she made at the threshold the halfstartled exclamation she gave as her eyes fell on the interior all showed that she was laboring under some secret agitation but what was the cause of that agitation i have not been able to determine she went in but as she did so i heard her murmur oak walls ah my soul it has come soon not a very intelligible exclamation you will allow but as intelligible as her whole conduct for in another moment every sign of emotion had left her and she stood quite calm and cold in the center of the room but her pallor remained and i cannot make sure now whether this betokened weary resignation or some secret and but half recognized fear had i looked at him instead of at her i might have understood the situation better but though i dimly perceived his form drawn up in the empty space at the left of the door it was not until she had passed him and flung herself into a chair that i thought to look in his direction then it was too late for he had turned his face aside and was gazing with rather an obtrusive curiosity at the oldfashioned room murmuring as he did so some such commonplaces to his wife as i hope you are not fatigued my dear fine old house this quite english in style eh to all of which she answered with a nod or word till suddenly without look or warning she slipped from her chair and lay perfectly insensible upon the dark boards of the wormeaten floor i uttered an exclamation and so did he but it was my arms that lifted her and laid her on the bed he stood as if frozen to his place for a moment then he mechanically lifted his foot and set it with an air of proprietorship on the box before which he had been standing strange and inexplicable conduct thought i and looked the indignation i could not but feel instantly he left his position and hastened to my side offering his assistance and advice with that heartless officiousness which is so unbearable when life and death are at stake i accepted as little of his help as was possible and when after persistent effort on my part i saw her lids fluttering and her breast heaving i turned to him with as inoffensive an air as my mingled dislike and distrust would admit and asked how long they had been married he flushed violently and with a sudden rage that at once robbed him of that gentlemanly appearance which in him was but the veneer to a coarse and brutal nature he exclaimed you and by what right do you ask that but before i could reply he recovered himself and was all false polish again bowing with exaggerated politeness as he exclaimed excuse me i have had much to disturb me lately my wifes health has been very feeble for months and i am worn out with anxiety and watching we are now on our way to a warmer climate where i hope she will be quite restored and he smiled a very strange and peculiar smile that went out like a suddenly extinguished candle as he perceived her eyes suddenly open and her gaze pass reluctantly around the room as if forced to a curiosity against which she secretly rebelled illustration i think mrs urquhart will do very well now was his hurried remark at this sight he evidently wished to be rid of me and though i hated to leave her i really found nothing to say in contradiction to his statement for she certainly looked completely restored i therefore turned away with a heavy heart toward the door when the young wife suddenly throwing out her arms exclaimed do not leave me in this horrible room alone i am afraid of it actually afraid couldnt you have found some spot in the house less gloomy edwin i came back there are plenty of rooms i began but he interrupted me without any ceremony i chose this room honora for its convenience there is nothing horrible about it and when the lamps are lit you will find it quite pleasant do not be foolish we sleep here or nowhere for i cannot consent to go upstairs she answered nothing but i saw her eyes go traveling once again around the walls followed in a furtive way by his whereupon i looked about me too and tried to get a strangers impression of the place i was astonished at its effect upon my imagination though i had been in and out of the room fifty times before i had never noticed till now the extreme dismalness and desolation of its appearance once used as an auxiliary parlor it had that air of uninhabitableness which clings to such rooms together with a certain something else equally unpleasant to which at that moment i could give no name and for which i could neither find then nor now any sufficient reason it was paneled with oak far above our heads and as the walls above had become gray with smoke there was absolutely no color in the room not even in the hangings of the gaunt fourposter that loomed dreary and repelling from one end of the room for here as elsewhere time had been at work and tints that were once bright enough had gradually been subdued by dust and smoke into one uniform dimness the floor was black the fireplace empty the walls without a picture and yet it was neither from this grayness nor from this barrenness that one recoiled it was from something else something that went deeper than the lack of charm or color something that clung to the walls like a contagion and caught at the heartstrings where they are weakest smothering hope and awakening horror till in each faded chair a ghost seemed sitting gazing at you with immovable eyes that could tell tales but would not there was but one window in the room and that looked toward the west but the light that should have entered there was frightened also and halted on the ledge without balked by the thick curtains that heavily enshrouded it a haunted chamber or so it appeared at that moment to my somewhat excited fancy and for the first time in my life here i felt a dread of my own house and experienced the uncanny sensation of some one walking over my grave but i soon recovered myself nothing of a disagreeable nature had ever happened in this room nor had we had any special reason for shutting it up except that it was in an outoftheway place and not usually considered convenient notwithstanding mr urquharts opinion to the contrary never mind said i with a last effort to soothe the agitated woman we will let in a little light and dissipate some of these shadows and i attempted to throw back the curtains of the window but they fell again immediately and i experienced a sensation as of something ghostly passing between us and the light provoked at my own weakness i tore the curtains down and flung them into a corner a straggling beam of sunset color came in but it looked out of place and forlorn upon that black floor like a stranger who meets with no welcome the poor young wife seemed to hail it however for she moved instantly to where it lay and stood as if she longed for its warmth and comfort i immediately glanced at the fireplace i will soon have a rousing fire for you i declared these old fireplaces hold a large pile of wood i thought but i must be mistaken that he made a gesture as if about to protest but if so reason must have soon come to his aid for he said nothing though he looked uneasy as i moved the andirons forward and made some other trivial arrangements for the fire which i had promised them he thinks i am never going i muttered to myself and took pleasure in lingering for anxious as i was to have the room heated up for her comfort i knew that every moment i stayed there would be one less for her to spend with her surly husband alone at last i had no further excuse for remaining and so with the final remark that if the fire failed to give them cheer we had a sitting room into which they could come i went out but i knew even while saying it that he would not grant her the opportunity of enjoying the sitting rooms coziness that he would not let her out of his sight if he did out of the room and that for her to remain in his presence was to be in darkness solitude and gloom no matter what walls surrounded her or in what light she stood my impressions were not far wrong mr and mrs urquhart came to supper but that was all before the others had finished their roast they had eaten their pudding and gone and though he had talked and laughed and shown his white teeth the impression left behind them was a depressing one which even hetty felt and she has anything but a sensitive nature i went to the room once again in the evening i found them both seated but in opposite parts of the room he by his great box and she in an easy chair which i had caused to be brought down from my own room for her especial use i did not look at him but i did at her and was astonished to see first how dignified she was and next how pretty had she been happy and at her ease i should probably have been afraid of her for the firelight which now shone on her wan young cheek brought out evidences of character and culture in her expression which proved her to be by birth and training of a position superior to what one would be led to expect from her husbands aspect and manner but she was not happy nor at her ease and wore instead of the quiet and commanding look of the great lady such an expression of secret dread that i almost forgot my position of landlady and should certainly if he had not been there fallen at her side and taken her poor forsaken head upon my breast but that silent immovable form sitting statuelike beside his big box smiling for aught i knew but if so breathing out a chill that forbade all exhibition of natural feeling held me in check as it held her so that i merely inquired whether there was anything i could do for her and when she shook her head starting a tear down her cheek as she did so i dared do nothing more than give her one look of sympathetic understanding and start for the door a command from him stopped me my wife will need a slight supper before she goes to bed said he will you be good enough to see that one is brought she roused herself up with quite a startled look of wonder why edwin she began i never have been in the habit but he hushed her at once i know what is best for you said he a small plate of luncheon mrs truax and let it be nice and inviting i courtesied gave her another glance and went out her countenance had not lost its look of wonder was he going to be considerate after all the lunch was prepared and taken to her not long after this the inn quieted down and such guests as were in the house prepared for rest midnight came all was dark in room and hall i was sure of this for i went through the whole building myself contrary to my usual habit which was to leave this task to my manofallwork burritt all was dark all was quiet and i was just dropping off to sleep when there shot up suddenly from below a shriek which was quickly smothered but not so quickly that i did not recognize in it that tone which is only given by hideous distress or mortal fear it is mrs urquhart i cried in terror to myself and plunging into my clothes i hurried down stairs chapter ii burritt illustration all was quiet in the halls but as i proceeded toward their room i perceived a figure standing near the doorway which in another moment i saw to be that of burritt he was trembling like a leaf and was bent forward listening hush he whispered they are talking all seems to be right i just heard him call her darling i drew the man away and took his place yes they were talking in subdued but not unkindly tones i heard him bid her be composed and caught as i thought a light reply that ought to have satisfied me that mrs urquhart had simply suffered from some nightmare horror at which she was as ready to laugh now as he but my nature is a contradictory one and i was not satisfied the echo of her cry was still ringing in my ears and i felt as if i would give the world for a momentary peep into their room influenced by this idea i boldly knocked and in an instant too soon for him not to have been standing near the door i heard his breath through the keyhole and the words who is there and what do you want we heard a cry was my response and i feared mrs urquhart was ill again mrs urquhart is very well came hastily almost gayly from within she had a dream and was willing that every one should know it is not that all he said seemingly addressing his wife there was a murmur within and then i heard her voice it was only a dream dear mrs truax it said and convinced against my will i was about to return to my room when i brushed against burritt he had not moved and did not look as if he intended to come said i there is no use of our remaining here cant help it was his whispered reply in this hall i stay till morning when i see a lamb in the care of a wolf i find it hard to sleep there is a door between us but please god there shant be anything more and knowing burritt i did not try to argue but went quietly and somewhat thoughtfully to my room vaguely relieved that i left him behind though convinced there would be no further need of his services and so it was no more sounds disturbed the house and when i came down with the first streak of daylight i found burritt gone about his work breakfast was served to the urquharts in their own room i had wished to carry it in myself but i found this inconvenient and so i sent hetty when she came back i asked her how mrs urquhart looked very well maam was the quick reply and see i dont think shes as unhappy as we all thought last night or she wouldnt be giving me a bright new crown i glanced at the girls palm there was indeed a bright new crown in it did she give you that i inquired yes maam she herself and she laughed when she did it and said it was for the good breakfast i had brought her i was busy at the time and could not stop to give the girls words much thought but as soon as i had any leisure i went to see for myself how mrs urquhart looked when she laughed i was five minutes too late she had just donned her traveling bonnet and veil and though i heard her laugh slightly once i did not see her face i saw his however and was surprised at the good nature in it he was quite the gentleman and if he had not been in such a hurry would have doubtless made or endeavored to make himself very agreeable but he was just watching his great box carried out to the wagon and while he took pains to talk to me was it to keep me from talking to her he was naturally a little absentminded he was in haste too and insisted upon placing his wife in the carriage before all his baggage was taken from the room and she seemed willing to go i watched her on purpose to see for i was not yet satisfied that she was not playing a part at his dictation but i could discover no hint of reluctance in her manner but rather a quiet alacrity as if she felt glad to quit a room to which she had taken a dislike when i saw this and noted the light step of her feet i said to myself that i had been a fool and lost a little of the interest i had felt for her nor did i regain it till after they had driven away though she showed a consideration for me at the last which i had not expected leaning from the carriage to give me a goodby pressure of the hand and even nodding again and again as they disappeared down the road for the fear which could be dissipated in a night was not the fear with which i had credited her and of ordinary excitements and commonplace natures i had seen enough in my long experience as landlady to make me unwilling to trouble myself with any more of them but when the carriage and its accompanying wagon had quite disappeared and mr and mrs urquhart were virtually as far beyond my reach as if they were already in new york i became conscious of a great uneasiness this was the more strange in that there seemed to be no especial cause for it they had left my house in apparently better spirits than they had entered it and there was no longer any reason why i should concern myself about them and yet i did concern myself and came into the house and into the room they had just vacated with feelings so unusual that i was astonished at myself and not a little provoked i had a vague feeling that the woman who had just left was somehow different from the one i had seen the night before but i am a busy woman and i do not think i should have let this trouble me long if it had not been for burritt but when he came into the room after me and shut the door behind him and stood with his back against it looking at me i knew i was not the only one who felt uncomfortable about the urquharts rising from the chair where i had been sitting counting the cost of fitting up that room so as to make it look habitable i went toward him and met his gaze pretty sharply well what is it i asked i dont know was the somewhat sullen reply i dont feel right about those folks and yet he stopped and scratched his head i dont know what im afraid of are you sure they left nothing behind them the last words were uttered in such a tone i did not know for a minute what to say left anything behind them i replied they left their money if that is what you mean i dont know what else they could have left notwithstanding which assertion i involuntarily glanced about the room as if half expecting to see some one of their many belongings protruding from a hitherto unsearched corner his gaze followed mine but presently returned and we stood again looking at each other nothing here said i where is it then he asked i frowned in displeasure where is what i demanded you speak like a fool explain yourself he took a step toward me and lowered his voice every one knows burritt so i need not describe him you can all imagine how he looked when he said did you see me handling of the big box maam i nodded yes saw how i was the one to help carry it in and also how i was the one to first take hold on it when he wanted it carried out i again nodded yes well maam that box was a heavy load to lift into the wagon but maam here his voice became quite sepulchral it wasnt as heavy as it was when we lifted it out and it hadnt the same feel either now what had happened to it and where is the stuff he took out of it i own i had never in my life felt creepy before that minute but with his eyes staring at me so impressively and his voice sunk to a depth that made me lean forward to hear what he had to say i do declare i felt as if an icy breath had been blown across the roots of my hair burritt you want to frighten me i exclaimed as soon as i could get my voice the box seemed heavier to you than it did just now there was no change in it there could not be or we should find something here to account for it remember you did not sleep last night and lack of rest makes one fanciful it does not make a man feel stronger though and i tell you the box was not near so heavy today as yesterday besides as i said before it acted differently under the handling there was something loose in it today yesterday it was packed tight i shook my head and tried to throw off the oppression caused by his manner but seeing his eyes travel to the window i looked that way too he didnt carry anything out of the door declared burritt at this moment because i watched it and i know but that window is only three feet from the ground and i remember now that at the instant i first laid my ear to the keyhole i heard a strange grating sound just like that of a window being lowered by a very careful hand shall i look outside it maam i replied by going quickly to the window myself lifting it which i did with very little trouble and glancing out the familiar garden with its path to the river lay before me but though i allowed myself one quick look in its direction it was to the ground immediately beneath the window that i turned my attention and it was here that i instantly and to the satisfaction of both burritt and myself discovered unmistakable signs of disturbance not only was there the impression of a finely booted foot imprinted in the loose earth but there was a large stone lying against the house which we were both confident had not been there the day before he went roaming through the garden last night cried burritt and he brought back that stone why i shuddered instead of replying then remembering that i had seen the young wife well and happy only a few minutes before felt confused and mystified beyond any power to express i will have a look at that stone continued burritt and without waiting for my sanction he vaulted out of the window and lifted the stone after a moments consideration of it he declared it came from the river bank that is all i can make out of it and dropping the stone from his hand he suddenly darted down the path to the river he was not gone long when he came back he looked still more doubtful than before if i know that bank he declared there has been more than one stone taken from it and some dirt suppose we examine the floor maam we did so and just where the box had been placed we discovered some particles of sand that were not brought in from the road what does it mean i cried burritt did not answer he was looking out toward the river suddenly he turned his eyes upon me and said in his former suppressed tone he filled the box with stone and earth and these were what we carried out and put into the wagon but it was full when it came and very heavy now what was it filled with and what has become of the stuff it was the question then it is the question now burritt hints at crime and has gone so far as to spend all the afternoon searching the river banks but he has discovered nothing nor can he explain what it was he looked for or expected to find nor are my own thoughts and feelings any clearer i remember that the times are unsettled that the spirit of revolution is in the air and try to be charitable enough to suppose that it was treasure the young husband brought with him and that all the perturbation and distress which i imagine myself to have witnessed in his behavior and that of his wife were owing to the purpose that they had formed of burying in this spot the silver and plate which they were perhaps unwilling to risk to the chances of war but when i try to stifle my graver fears with this surmise i recall the fearful nature of the shriek which startled me from my sleep and repeat tremblingly to myself some one was in mortal agony at the moment i heard that cry was it the young wife or was it chapter iii a fearful discovery april it is sixteen years since i wrote the preceding chapters of this history of mystery and crime when the pen dropped from my hand why did it drop was it because of some noise i heard i imagine so now and tremble i did not anticipate ever adding a line to the words i had written the impulse which had led me to put upon paper my doubts concerning the two urquharts soon passed and as nothing ever occurred to recall this couple to my mind i gradually allowed their name and memory to vanish from my thoughts only remembering them when chance led me into the oak parlor then indeed i recollected their manner and my fears and then i also felt repeated though every time with fainter and fainter power the old thrill of undefined terror which stopped my record of that day with the halffinished question as to who had uttered the shriek that had startled me the night before today i again take up my pen why because today and only since today can i answer this question sixteen years ago which makes me sixteen years older my house too has aged and the oak parlor i never refurnished it is darker gloomier and more forbidding than it was then and in truth why should it not be when i remember what was revealed to me a week ago i wonder that its walls did not drop fungi and its chill strike death through the man or woman who was brave enough to enter it horrible horrible room you shall be torn from my house if the rest of the structure goes with you neither i nor another shall ever enter your fatal portal again it was a week ago today that the coach from new york set down at my door a stranger of fine and quaint appearance whose white hair betokened him to be aged but whose alert and energetic movements showed that if he had passed the line of fourscore he had still enough of the fire of youth remaining to make his presence welcome in whatever place he chose to enter as had happened sixteen years before i was looking out of the window when the coach drove up and being at once attracted by the strangers person and manner i watched him closely while he was alighting and was surprised to observe what intent and searching glances he cast at the house he could not be more interested if he were returning to the home of his fathers i murmured involuntarily to myself and hastened to the door in order to receive him he came forward courteously but after the first few words between us he turned again and gazed with marked curiosity up and down the road and again at the house you seem to be acquainted with these parts i ventured he smiled this is an old house he answered and you are young i am fiftyfive there must have been owners of the place before you do you know their names i bought the place of dan forsyth and he of one hammond i dont know as i can go back any further than that originally the house was the property of an englishman there were strange stories about him but it was so long ago that they are almost forgotten the stranger smiled again and followed me into the house here his interest seemed to redouble instantly a thought flashed through my brain he is its ancient owner the englishman i am standing in the presence of you wish to know my name interrupted his genial voice it is tamworth i am a virginian and hope to stay at your inn one night what kind of a room have you to offer me there was a twinkle in his eyes i did not understand he was looking down the hall and i thought his gaze rested on the corridor leading to the oak parlor i should like to sleep on the ground floor he added i have but one room i began and one is all i want he smiled then with a quick glance at my face i suppose you are a little particular whom you put into the oak parlor it is not every one who can appreciate such romantic surroundings i surveyed him completely puzzled whereupon he looked at me with an expression of surprise and incredulity that added to the mystery of the moment the room is gloomy and uninviting i declared but beyond that i do not know of any especial claim it has upon our interest you astonish me was his evidently sincere reply and he walked on very thoughtfully straight to the room of which we were speaking at the door he paused dont you know the secret of this room he asked giving me a very bright and searching glance if you mean anything concerning the urquharts i began doubtfully urquharts he carelessly repeated i do not know anything about them i am speaking of an old tradition i was told let me see how long it is now well it must be sixteen years at least that this house contained a hidden chamber communicating with a certain oak parlor in the west wing i thought it was curious and why madam i beg your pardon i did not mean to distress you can it be possible that you were ignorant of this fact you the owner of this house are you sure it is a fact i gasped i was trembling in every limb but managed to close the door behind us before i sank into a chair i have lived in this house twenty years i know its rooms and halls as i do my own face and never never have i suspected that there was a nook or corner in it which was not open to the light of day yet yet it is true that the rooms on this floor are smaller than those above this one especially and i cast a horrified glance about me that reminded me even against my will of the searching and peculiar look i had seen cast in the same direction by mr urquhart sixteen years before i see that i have stumbled upon a bit of knowledge that has been kept from the purchasers of this property observed the old gentleman well that does not detract from the interest of the occasion when i knew i was to pass this way i said to myself i shall certainly stop at the old inn with the secret chamber in it but i did not think i should be the first one to disclose its secret to the present generation but my information seems to affect you strangely is it such a disturbing thing to find that ones house has held a disused spot within it that might have been made useful if you had known of its existence i could not answer i was enveloped in a strange horror and was only conscious of the one wish that burritt had lived to help me through the dreadful hour i saw before me let us see if my information has been correct continued mr tamworth perhaps there has been some mistake the secret chamber if there is one should be behind this chimney shall i hunt for an opening i managed to shake my head i had not strength for the experiment yet i wanted to prepare myself tell me first how you heard about this room i entreated he drew his chair nearer to mine with the greatest courtesy there is no reason why i should not tell you replied he and as i see that you are in no mood for a long story i shall make my words as few as possible some years ago i had occasion to spend a night in an inn not unlike this on long island i was alone but there was a merry crowd in the tap room and being fond of good company i presently found myself joining in the conversation the talk was of inns and many a stirring story of adventure in outoftheway taverns did i listen to that night before the clock struck twelve each man present had some humorous or thrilling experience to relate with the exception of a certain glum and darkbrowed gentleman who sat somewhat apart from the rest and who said nothing his reticence was in such marked contrast to the volubility about him that he finally attracted universal attention and more than one of the merrymakers near him asked if he had not some anecdote to add to the rest but though he replied with sufficient politeness it was evident that he had no intention of dropping his reserve and it was not till the party had broken up and the room was nearly cleared that he deigned to address any one then he turned to me and with a very peculiar smile remarked a dull collection of tales sir bah if they had wanted to hear of an inn that was really romantic i could have told them what i involuntarily ejaculated you will not torture me by suggesting a mystery you will not explain he looked very indifferent it is nothing he declared only i know of an inn at least it is used for an inn now which has in its interior a secret chamber so deftly hidden away in the very heart of the house that i doubt if even its present owner could find it without the minutest directions from the man who saw it built i knew that man he was an englishman and he had a fancy to make his fortune through the aid of smuggled goods he did it and though always suspected was never convicted owing to the fact that he kept all his goods in this hidden room the place is sold now but the room remains i wonder if any forgotten treasures lie in it imagination could easily run riot over the supposition do you not think so sir i certainly did especially as i imagined myself to detect in every line of his able and crafty face that he bore a closer relation to the englishman than he would have me believe i did not betray my feelings however but urged him to tell me how in a modern house a room or even a closet could be so concealed as not to awaken any ones suspicion he answered by taking out pencil and paper and showing me by a few lines the secret of its construction then seeing me deeply interested he went on to say we find what we have been told to search for but here is a case where the secret has been so well kept that in all possibility the question of this rooms existence has never arisen it is just as well meantime i was studying the plan the hidden chamber lies said i between this room designating one with my forefinger and these two others from which is it entered he pointed at the one i had first indicated from this he affirmed and a quaint oldfashioned room it is too with a wainscoting of oak all around it as high as a mans head it used to be called the oak parlor and many a time has its floor rung to the tread of the kings soldiers who disappointed in their search for hidden goods consented to take a drink at their hosts expense little recking that but a few feet away behind the carven chimneypiece upon which they doubtless set down their glasses there lay heaps and heaps of the richest goods only awaiting their own departure to be scattered through the length and breadth of the land and this house is now an inn i remarked yes curious i should like nothing better than to visit that inn you doubtless have it is not this one i suddenly cried looking uneasily about me oh no it is on the hudson river not fifty miles this side of albany it is called the happygolucky and is in a womans hands at present but it prospers i believe perhaps because she has discovered the secret and knows where to keep her stores and with a shrug of his shoulders he dismissed the subject with the remark i dont know why i told you of this i never made it the subject of conversation before in my life this was just before the outbreak in lexington sixteen years ago maam and this is the first time i have found myself in this region since that day but i have never forgotten this story of a secret room and when i took the coach this morning i made up my mind that i would spend the night here and if possible see the famous oak parlor with its mysterious adjunct never dreaming that in all these years of your occupancy you would have remained as ignorant of its existence as he hinted and you have now declared mr tamworth paused looking so benevolent that i summoned up my courage and quietly informed him that he had not told me what kind of a looking man this stranger was was he young i asked had he a blond complexion on the contrary interrupted mr tamworth he was very dark and in years as old or nearly as old as myself i was disappointed i had expected a different reply as he talked of the stranger i had rightfully or wrongfully with reason or without reason seen before me the face of mr urquhart and this description of a dark and wellnigh aged man completely disconcerted me are you certain this man was not in disguise i asked disguise are you certain that he was not young and blond and quite sure was the dry interruption no disguise could transform a young blood into the man i saw that night may i ask in my turn i interrupted him pardon me i entreated but an anxiety i will presently explain forces another question from me were you and this stranger alone in the room when you held this conversation you say that it had been full a few minutes before were there none of the crowd remaining besides your two selves mr tamworth looked thoughtful it is sixteen years ago he replied but i have a dim remembrance of a man sitting at a table somewhat near us with his face thrown forward on his arms he seemed to be asleep i did not notice him particularly did you not see his face no was he young i should say so and blond that i cannot say and he remained in that attitude all the time you were talking yes madam and continued so when you left the room i think so was he within earshot near enough to hear all you said most assuredly if he listened mr tamworth i now entreated try if possible to remember one other fact if each man present told a story that night you must have had ample opportunity of noting each mans face and observing how he looked now of all that sat in the room was there not one of an age not exceeding thirtyfive of fair complexion and gentlemanly appearance yet with a dangerous look in his small blue eye and a something in his smile that took all the merriment out of it a short but telling description commented my guest let me see was there such a man among them really i cannot remember think think hair very thin above the temples mustache heavy when he spoke he invariably moved his hands seemed to be nervous and anxious to hide it i see him was mr tamworths sudden remark that description of his hands recalls him to my mind yes there was such a man in the room that night i even recollect his story it was coarse but not without wit i advanced and surveyed mr tamworth very earnestly the man you thought asleep the man who was near enough to hear all the englishman said was he or was he not the same we have just been talking about i never thought of it before but he did look something like him his figure i mean i did not see his face it was he i murmured with intense conviction and the villain but how did i know he was a villain i paused and pointed to the huge mantel guarding the fireplace if you know how to enter the secret room do so only i should like to have a few witnesses present besides myself will you wait till i call one or two of my lodgers he bowed with great urbanity if you wish to make the discovery public said he i of course have no objection but i saw that he was disappointed i can never confront the secret of that room alone i insisted i must have dr kenyon here at least and without waiting for my impulses to cool i sent a message to the doctors room and was rewarded in a moment by the appearance at the door of that excellent man it did not take many words for me to explain to him our intentions we were going to search for a secret chamber which we had been told opened into the room in which we then found ourselves as i did not wish to make any mystery of the affair and as i naturally had my doubts as to what the room might disclose i asked the support of his presence he was gratified the doctor always is gratified at any token of appreciation and perceiving that i had no further reason for delay i motioned to mr tamworth to proceed illustration how he discovered the one movable panel in that oldfashioned wainscoting i have never inquired when i saw him turn toward the fireplace and lay his ear to the wall i withdrew in haste to the window feeling as if i could not bear to watch him or be the first to catch a glimpse of the mysterious depths which in another moment must open before his touch what i feared i cannot say as far as i could reason on the subject i had no cause to fear anything and yet my shaking frame and unevenly throbbing heart were but the too sure tokens of an excessive and uncontrollable agitation the view from the window increased it before me lay the river from whose banks sand and stone had been taken sixteen years before to replace what i knew no more this minute than i did then i might know in the next by the faint tapping that came to my ears i must and it was this thought that sent a chill through me and made it so difficult for me to stand and yet why should it was not that old theory of ours that the urquharts had brought treasure in their great box still a plausible one nay more was it not even a probable one since we had discovered that the house held so excellent a hiding place unknown to the world at large but known to this man as mr tamworths story so plainly showed yes and yet i started with uncontrollable forebodings when i heard an exclamation of satisfaction behind me and hardly found courage to turn around even when i knew that an opening had been effected and that they were only waiting for my approach to enter it and it took courage both on my part and on theirs for the air which rushed from the high and narrow slit of darkness before us was stifling and almost deadly but in a few minutes after one or two experiments with a lighted candle dr kenyon stepped through the opening followed by mr tamworth and in a long minute afterward by myself shall i ever forget my emotions as i looked about me and saw by the lamp which the doctor carried nothing more startling than an old oak chest in one corner a pile of faded clothing in another and in a third heavens what is it we all stare and then a shriek escapes my lips as piercing and terrorstricken as any that ever disturbed those fearful shadows and i rush blindly from the spot followed by mr tamworth whose face as i turn to look at him gives me another pang of fear so white and sick it looks in the sudden glare of day worse than i had thought worse than i had dreamed i cannot speak and fall into a chair waiting in mortal terror for the doctor who stayed some minutes behind when his kindly but not undisturbed countenance showed itself again in the gap at the side of the fireplace i could almost have thrown myself at his feet illustration what is it i gasped tell me at once is it a man or a woman or it is a woman see here is a lock of her hair beautiful is it not she must have been young i stared at it like one demented it was of a peculiar reddishbrown with a strange little kink and curl in it where had i seen such hair before somewhere i remembered perfectly how the whole bright head looked with the firelight playing over it oh no no no it was not that of mrs urquhart mrs urquhart went away from this house well and happy i am mad or this strand of gleaming hair is a dream it is not her head it recalls to me and yet my soul it is the doctor knowing me well did not try to break the silence of that first grewsome minute but when he saw me ready to speak he remarked it is an old crime perpetrated probably before you came into the house i would not make any more of it than you can help mrs truax i scarcely heeded him is there no bit of clothing or jewelry left upon her by which we might hope to identify her i asked shuddering as i caught mr tamworths eye and realized the nature of the doubts i there beheld here is a ring i found upon the wedding finger he replied it was doubtless too small to be drawn off at the time of her death but it came away easily enough now and he held out a plain gold circlet which i eagerly took looked at and fell at their feet as senseless as a stone on the inner surface i had discovered this legend e u to h d jan chapter iv questions and answers never have i felt such relief as when upon my resuscitation i remembered that i had put upon paper all the events and all the suspicions which had troubled me during that fatal night of january the th sixteen years before with that in my possession i could confront any suspicion which might arise and it was this thought which lent to my bearing at this unhappy time a dignity and selfpossession which evidently surprised the two gentlemen you seem more shocked than astonished was mr tamworths first remark as mistress once more of myself i led the way out of that horrible room into one breathing less of death and the charnel house you are right said i mysteries which have troubled me for years are now in the way of being explained by this discovery i knew that something either fearful or precious had been left in the keeping of this house or grounds but i did not know what this something was and least of all did i suspect that its hiding place was between walls whose turns and limitations i thought i knew as well as i do the paths of my garden you speak riddles dr kenyon now declared you knew that something fearful or precious had been left in your house pardon me i interrupted i said house or grounds i thought it was in the grounds for how could i think that the house could without my knowledge hold anything of the nature i have just suggested you knew then that a person had been murdered no i persisted with a strange calmness considering how agitated i was both by my memories and the fears i could not but entertain for the future i know nothing nor can i even with the knowledge of this discovery understand or explain what took place in my house sixteen years ago and in a few hurried words i related the story of the mysterious couple who had occupied that room on the night of january they listened to me as if i were repeating a fairy tale and as i noted the sympathizing air with which dr kenyon tried to hide his natural incredulity i again congratulated myself that i had been a weak enough woman to keep an account of the events which had so impressed me you think i am drawing upon my imagination i quietly remarked as silence fell upon my narration by no means the doctor began hurriedly but the details you give are so open to question and the conclusions you expect us to draw from them are so serious that i wish for your own sake we had heard something of the urquharts and your doubts and suspicions in their regard before we had made the discovery which points to death and crime you see i speak plainly mrs truax you cannot speak too plainly doctor kenyon and my opinion so entirely coincides with yours that i am going to furnish you with what you ask and without heeding their looks of astonishment i rang the bell for one of the girls and sent her to a certain drawer in my desk for the folded paper which she would find there here i exclaimed as the paper was brought read this and you will soon see how i felt about the urquharts on the evening of the day they left us and i put into their hands the record i had made of that days experience while they were reading it i puzzled myself with questions if this body which we had just found sepulchered in my house was as the initials in the ring seemed to declare that of honora urquhart who was the woman who passed for her at the time of the departure of this accused couple from my doors i was with them and saw the lady and supposed her to be the same i had entertained at my table the night before but then i chiefly noted her dress and height and did not see her face which was hidden by her veil and did not hear her voice beyond the short and somewhat embarrassed laugh she gave at some little incident which had occurred but hetty had seen her and had even received money from her hand and hetty could not have been deceived nor was hetty a girl to be bribed how was i then to understand the matter and where in case another woman had taken mrs urquharts place had that woman come from i thought of the low window and the ease with which any one could climb into it and then with a flash of startled conviction i thought of the huge box great heavens i ejaculated feeling the hair stir anew on my forehead can it be that he brought her in that that she was with them all the time and that the almost hellish tragedy to which this ring points was the scheme of two vile and murderous lovers to suppress an unhappy wife that stood in the way of their desires i could not think it i could not believe that any man could be so void of mercy or any woman so lost to every instinct of decency as to plan and then coolly carry out to the end a crime so unheard of in its atrocity there must be some other explanation of the facts before us why the date in the ring is enough if that speaks true the marriage between edwin urquhart and the gentle honora was but a day old and even the worst of men take time to weary of their wives before they take measures against them yet the look and manner of the man his affection for the box and his manifest indifference for his wife and lastly and most convincing of all this awful token in the room beyond what should i what could i think at this point in my surmises i grew so faint that i turned to dr kenyon and mr tamworth for relief they had just finished my record of the past and were looking at each other in surprise and horror it surpasses the most atrocious deeds of the middle ages quoth mr tamworth in a country deemed civilized finished the doctor then you think i tremblingly began that you have harbored two demons under your roof mrs truax there seems to be no doubt that the woman who went away with mr urquhart was not the woman who came with him she lies here while the other he paused and mr tamworth took up the word it seems to have been a strangely triumphant piece of villainy the woman who profited by it must have had great selfcontrol and force of character dont you think so doctor unquestionably was the firm reply you do not say how you account for her presence here i now reluctantly intimated i think she was hidden in the great box it was large enough for that was it not mrs truax i nodded much agitated his care of it his call for a supper the change in its weight and the fact that its contents were of a different character in going than coming all point to the fact of its having been used for the purpose we intimated it strikes one as most horrible but history furnishes us with precedents of attempts equally daring and if the box was well furnished with holes did you notice any breathing places in it no i returned but i did not cast two glances at the box i was jealous of it for the young wifes sake though as god knows i had little idea of what it contained and merely noticed that it was big and clumsy and capable of holding many books yet you must have noticed even in a cursory glance whether its top or sides were broken by holes they were not but but what i do remember now that he flung his travelingcloak across it just as the men went to lift it from the wagon and that the cloak remained upon it all the time it was in their hands and until after we had all left the room but it was taken away later for when i went in the second time i saw it lying across the chair and the box was hidden by the foot of the bed behind which he had dragged it and the cloak was it over the box when it went out no but i have thought since we have been talking that the box might have been turned over after its occupant left it the holes if there were any would thus be on the bottom and would escape our detection very possible but the sand with which we supposed the box had been filled would have sifted through not if a good firm piece of stuff was laid in first and there were plenty of such in the secret chamber that is true but burritt you write was listening at the door and yet you mention no remarks of his concerning any noises heard by him from within and noise must have been made if this was done as it must have had to be done after the tragedy i know i do not was the hurried reply but burritt probably did not remain at the door all the time there is a window seat at the end of the corridor and upon it he probably lolled during the few hours of his watch besides you must remember that burritt left his post some time before daylight he had his duties to attend to some of which necessitated his being in the stables by four oclock at least i see and so the affair prospered as most very daring deeds do and they escaped without suspicion or rather without suspicion pointed enough to lead to their being followed i wonder where they escaped to and if in all the years that have elapsed they have for one moment imagined that they were happy happy was my horrified exclamation oh if i could find them if i could drag them both to this room and make them keep company with their victim for a week i should feel it too slight a retribution for them heaven has had its eye upon them we have been through fearful crises since that day and much unrighteous as well as righteous blood has been shed in this land they may both be dead i do not believe it i muttered such wretches never die then with a renewed remembrance of hetty i remarked curses on the duties that kept me out of this room on that fatal morning had i seen the womans face this horrid crime would at least been spared its triumph but i was obliged to send hetty and she saw nothing strange in the woman though she received money from her hand and where is hetty interrupted the doctor she is married and lives in the next town so so well we must hunt her up tomorrow and see what she has to say about the matter now but we soon found ourselves too impatient to wait till the morrow so after we had eaten a good supper in a cheerful room dr kenyon mounted his horse and rode away to the farm house where hetty lived while he was gone mr tamworth summoned up courage to reenter that cave of horror and bring out the contents of the oak chest we had seen there these were mostly stuffs in a more or less good state of preservation and all the assistance they lent to the understanding of the tragedy that mystified us was the fact that the chest contained nothing nor the room itself of sufficient substance to help the wicked urquhart in giving weight to the box which he had emptied of its living freight this is doubtless the reason he resorted to the garden for the sand and stone he found there dr kenyon returned about midnight and was met at the door by mr tamworth and myself well i cried in great excitement just as i supposed he returned she did not see the ladys face either the latter was in bed and the girl took it for granted that the arm and hand which reached her out a silver piece from between the bed curtains were those of mrs urquhart my house is cursed was my sudden exclamation it has not only lent itself to the success of the most demoniacal scheme that ever entered into the heart of man but it has kept its secret so long that all hope of explaining its details or reaching the guilty must be abandoned not so quoth mr tamworth though an old man i dedicate myself to this task you will hear again of the urquharts chapter v an interim of suspense may how fearful to hear a spade in the night and know that this spade is digging a grave i sit at my desk and listen to hear if any one in the house has been aroused or is suspicious and then i turn to the window and try to pierce the gloom to see if anything can be discerned from the house of the grewsome act now being performed in the garden for after much consultation and several conferences with the authorities we have decided to preserve from public knowledge not only the secret of the room hidden in my house but of the discovery which has lately been made there but while much harm would accrue to me by revelations which would throw a pall of horror over my inn and make it no better than a place of morbid curiosity forever the purposes of justice would be rather hindered than helped by a publicity which would give warning to the guilty couple and prevent us from surprising them in the imagined security which the lapse of so many years must have brought them and so a grave is being dug in the garden where at the darkest hour of night the remains of the sweet and gentle bride are to be placed without tablet or mound meanwhile do there hide in any part of this wicked world two hearts which throb with unusual terrors this night or does there pass across the mirror of a guilty memory any unusual shapes of horror prognostic of detection and coming punishment it would comfort my uneasy heart to know for the spirit of vengeance has seized upon me and my house will never seem washed of its stain or my conscience be quite at rest as to the past till that vile man and woman pay in some way the penalty of their crime that we know nothing of them but their names lends an interest to their pursuit the very difficulty before us the hopelessness almost of the task we have set ourselves have raised in me a wild and wellnigh superstitious reliance on providence and the eternal justice so that it seems natural for me to expect aid even from such sources as dreams and visions and make the inquiry in which i have just indulged the reasonable expression of my belief in the mysterious forces of right and wrong which will yet bring this long triumphant but now secretly threatened pair to justice dr kenyon who is as practical as he is pious smiles at my confidence but mr tamworth neither mocks nor frowns he has shouldered the responsibility of finding this man and has often observed in his long life that a womans intuitions go as far as a mans reasoning tomorrow he will start upon his travels june it is foolish to put every passing thought on paper but these sheets have already served me so well that i cannot resist the temptation of making them the repositories of my secret fears and hopes mr tamworth has been gone a month and i have heard nothing from him this is all the more difficult to bear that dr kenyon also has left me thus taking from my house all in whom i can confide or to whom i can talk for i will not place confidence in servants and there are no guests here at present upon whose judgment i can rely concerning even a lesser matter than this which occupies all my thoughts i must talk then to thee unknown reader of these lines and declare on paper what i have said a thousand times to myself what a mystery this whole matter is and how little probability there is of our ever understanding it why was it that edwin urquhart if he loved one woman so well that he was willing to risk his life to gain her would subject himself to the terrors which must follow any crime no matter how secretly performed by marrying a woman he must kill in twentyfour hours marriages are not compulsory in this country and any one must acknowledge that it would be easier for a strong man and he certainly was no weakling to refuse a woman at the nuptial altar than to undertake and carry out a scheme so full of revolting details and involving so much risk as this which we have been forced to ascribe to him then the woman the unknown and fearful creature who had allowed herself to be boxed up and carried god knows how many fearful miles just for the purpose of assuming a position which she seemingly might have obtained in ways much less repulsive and dangerous was it in human nature to go through such an ordeal and if it were what could the circumstances have been that would drive even the most insensible nature into such an adventure i question and try to answer my own inquiries but my imagination falters over the task and i am no nearer to the satisfaction of my doubts than i was in the harrowing minute when the knowledge of this tragedy first flashed upon me i must have patience mr tamworth must write to me soon august news news and such news how could i ever have dreamed of it but let me transcribe mr tamworths letter to mrs clarissa truax mistress of the happygolucky inn respected madam after a lengthy delay occupied in researches made doubly difficult by the changes which have been wrought in the country by the late conflict i have just come upon a fact that has the strongest bearing upon the serious tragedy which we are both so interested in investigating it is this that every year the agent of a certain large estate in albany n y forwards to france a large sum of money for the use and behoof of one honora quentin urquhart daughter of the late cyrus dudleigh of albany and wife of one edwin urquhart a gentleman of that same city to whom she was married in her fathers house on january and with whom she at once departed for france where she and her husband have been living ever since thus by chance almost have i stumbled upon an explanation of the tragedy we found so inexplicable and found that clew to the whereabouts of the wretched pair which is so essential to their apprehension and the proper satisfaction of the claims of justice with great consideration i sign myself your obedient servant anthony tamworth august oclock i was so overwhelmed by the above letter that i found it impossible at the time to comment upon it today it is too late for this morning a packet arrived from mr tamworth containing another letter of such length that i am sure it must be one of complete explanation i burn to read it but i have merely had time to break the seal and glance at the first opening words will my guests be so kind as to leave me in peace tonight so that i may satisfy a curiosity which has become almost insupportable midnight no time tonight too tired almost to write this august the packet is read i am all of a tremble what a tale what a but why encumber these sheets with words of mine i will insert the letter and let it tell its own portion of the strange and terrible history which time is slowly unrolling before us part ii an old albany romance chapter vi the recluse to mrs clarissa truax of the happygolucky inn respected madam appreciating your anxiety i hasten to give you the particulars of an interview which i have just had with a person who knew edwin urquhart they must be acceptable to you and i shall make no excuse for the length of my communication knowing that each detail in the lives of the three persons connected with this crime must be of interest to one who has brooded upon the subject as long as you have the person to whom i allude is a certain mark felt a most eccentric and unhappy being now living the life of a recluse amid the forests of the catskills i became acquainted with his name at the time of my first investigation into the history of the dudleigh and urquhart families and it was to him i was referred when i asked for such particulars as mere neighbors and public officials found it impossible to give i was told however at the same time that i should find it hard to gain his confidence as for sixteen years now he had avoided the companionship of men by hiding in the caves and living upon such food as he could procure through the means of gun and net a disappointment in love was said to be at the bottom of this the lady he was engaged to having thrown herself into the river at about the time of the marriage of his friend he was notwithstanding a goodhearted man and if i could once break through the reserve he had maintained for so many years they thought i would be able to surprise facts from him which i could never hope to reach in any other way interested by these insinuations and somewhat excited for an old man at the prospect of bearding such a lion in his den i at once made up my mind to seek this felt and accordingly one bright day last week crossed the river and entered the forest i was not alone i had taken a guide who knew the location of the cave which felt was supposed to inhabit and through his efforts my journey was made as little fatiguing as possible fallen brambles were removed from my path limbs lifted and where the road was too rough for the passage of such faltering feet as mine i found myself lifted bodily in arms as strong and steadfast as steel and carried like a child to where it was smoother thus i was enabled to traverse paths that at first view appeared inaccessible and finally reached a spot so far up the mountain side that i gazed behind me in terror lest i should never be able to return again the way i had come my guide seeing my alarm assured me that our destination was not far off and presently i perceived before me a huge overhanging cliff from the upper ledges of which hung down a tangle of vines and branches that veiled without wholly concealing the yawning mouth of a cave that is where the man we are seeking lives eats and sleeps quoth my guide as we paused for a moment to regain our breath and immediately upon his words and as if called forth by them we perceived an unkempt and disheveled head slowly uprear itself through the black gap before us then hastily disappear again behind the vines it had for a moment disturbed i will encounter him alone i thereupon declared and leaving the guide behind me i pushed forward to the cliff and pausing before the entrance of the cave i called aloud mark felt do you want to hear news from your friend urquhart for a moment all was still and i began to fear that my somewhat daring attempt had failed in its effect but this was only for an instant for presently something between a growl and a cry issued from the darkness within and the next moment the wild and disheveled head showed itself again and i heard distinctly these words he is no friend of mine your edwin urquhart then i returned without a moments hesitation do you want to hear news of your enemy for i have some and of the rarest nature too the wild eyes flashed as if a flame of fire had shot from them and the head that held them advanced till i could see the whole bearded countenance of the man is he dead he asked with an eagerness and underlying triumph in the voice that argued well for the presence of those passions upon the rousing of which i relied for the revelations i sought no said i but death is looking his way with a little more knowledge of his early life and a little more insight into his character at the time he married honora dudleigh the law will have so firm a hold upon him that i can safely promise any one who longs to see him pay the penalty of his evil deeds a certain opportunity of doing so illustration the vines trembled and suddenly parted their full length and mark felt stepped out into the sunshine and confronted me what he wore i cannot say for his personality was so strong i received no impression of anything else not that he was tall or picturesque or even rudely handsome on the contrary he was as plain a man as i had ever seen with eyes to which some defect lent a strange fixed glare and a mouth whose under jaw protruded so markedly beyond the upper that his profile gave you a shock when any slight noise or stir drew his head to one side and thus revealed it to you yet in spite of all this in spite of tangled locks and a wide rough beard half brown half white his face held something that fixed the attention and fascinated the eye that encountered it did it lie in his eyes how could it with one looking like a fixed stone of agate and the other like a rolling ball of fire was it in his smile how could it be when his smile had no joy in it only a satisfaction that was not of good but evil and promised trouble rather than relief or sympathy it must be in the general expression of his features which seemed made only to mirror the emotions of a soul full of vitality and purpose a soul which if clouded by wrongs and embittered by heavy memories possessed at least the characteristic of force and the charm of an unswerving purpose he seemed to recognize the impression he had made for his lips smiled with a sort of scornful triumph before he said these are peculiar words for a stranger may i ask your name and whose interests you represent his speech was quick and had an odd halt in it such as might be expected from one who had not conferred with his fellows for years but there was no rudeness in its tone nor was there any mistaking the fact that he was both by nature and education a gentleman i began to take an interest in him apart from my mission mr felt i replied my name is tamworth i am from virginia and only by chance have i become involved in a matter near to you and the man who you tell me is or was your enemy as for the interests i represent they are those of justice and justice only and it is in her behalf and for the triumph of law and righteousness that i now ask you for your confidence and such details concerning your early intercourse with edwin urquhart as will enable me to understand a past that will certainly yield us a clew to the present are you willing to give them will i give them he laughed will i break the seal which guards the tablets of my youth and let a strangers eyes read lines to which i have shut my own for these many years do you not know that for me to tell you what i once knew of edwin urquhart is to bare my own breast to view and subject to new sufferings a heart that it has taken fifteen years of solitude to render callous i gave no answer to this only looked at him and stood waiting you have hunted me out you have touched the last string that ceases to vibrate in a mans breast that of a wild desire for vengeance and now you ask me to ease your memories of a burden to drag into light the skeleton of old days and by the light thus thrown upon it to see that it is only a skeleton that once beheld should be buried and its old bones forgotten you are too much of a man felt to waste away in these wilds come forget i am a stranger and relieve yourself and me by opening these tablets you speak of even if it does cost you a pang of the old sorrow the talk we have had has already made a flutter in the longclosed leaves and should i leave you this minute you could not smother the thoughts and memories to which our conversation has given rise then why not think to purpose and he raised one hand and stopped me the gesture was full of fire and so was the eye he now turned away from me to gaze up at the overhanging steeps above with their great gorges and magnificent play of light and shadow at the valley beneath with its broad belt of shining water winding in and out through fertile banks and growing towns and finally at the blue dome of the sky across which great clouds went sailing in shapes so varied and of size so majestic that it was like a vision of floating palaces on a sea of translucent azure gasping in a strange mood between delight and despair he flung up his arms ah i have loved these hills of all the longings and affections that one by one have perished from my heart the solitary passion for nature has alone remained unlessened and undisturbed i love these trees with their countless boughs these rocks with their hidden pitfalls and sudden precipices the sky that bends above me here is bluer than any other sky and when it frowns and gathers its storms together and hurls them above these ledges and upon my uncovered head i throw up my arms as i do now and exult in the tumult and become a part of it till the hunger in my soul is appeased and the blood in my veins runs mildly again and now i must quit all this i must give to men thoughts that have been closely wedded to nature i must tear her image from my heart and in her pure place substitute interests in a life i thought forever sacrificed to her worship it is a bitter task but i will perform it there are other calls than those which reverberate from yon peaks i have just heard one and my feet go down once more into the valleys his arms fell with the last words and his eyes returned again to my face come into the cave said he i cannot tell my story in the sight of these pure skies i followed him without a word he had affected me the invocation in which he had indulged and which from another man and other circumstances would have struck me as a theatrical attempt upon my sympathy as forced as it was unnatural was in him so appropriate and in such keeping with the grandeur of the scene by which we were surrounded that i was disarmed of criticism and succumbed without resistance to his power the cave once entered was light enough on the ground were spread in profusion leaves and twigs of the sweetsmelling cedar making a carpet as pleasing as it was warm and healthful on one side i saw a mound of the same making a couch across which a great cloak was spread while beyond the halfdefined forms of a rude seat and table appeared lending an air of habitableness to the spot which from the exterior i had hardly expected to find a long slab of stone served as a hearth and above it i perceived a hole in the rock toward which a thin column of smoke was rising from a few smouldering embers that yet remained burning upon the great stone below altogether it was a home i had entered and awed a little at the remembrance that it had been the refuge of this solitary man through years pregnant with events forever memorable in the history of the world as those which gave birth to a new nation i sank down upon the pile of cedar he pointed out to me and waited in some impatience for him to begin his tale this he seemed in no hurry to do he waited so long with his chin sunk in his two hands and his eyes fixed upon vacancy that i grew restless and was about to break the silence myself when without moving he suddenly spoke chapter vii two women you want to hear about edwin urquhart well you shall but first i promise you that i shall talk much less of him than of another person why because it is on account of this other person that i hate him and solely because of this other person that i avenge myself or seek to assist others in avenging the justice you say he has outraged we were friends from boyhood reared in the same town and under the same influences there was a community of interests between us that threw us together and made us what is called friends but i never liked him that is i never felt a confidence in him which is essential to a mutual understanding and though i accepted his companionship and was much with him at the most critical time of my life i always kept one side and that the better side of my nature closed to him he was a gentleman with no expectations i the inheritor of a small fortune that made my friendship of temporary use to him even if it did not offer him much to rely on in the future we lived he with an uncle who was ready to throw him off the moment he was assured that he would not marry one of his daughters and i in my own house which if no manor was at least my own and for the present free from debt i myself thought that urquhart intended to marry one of the girls to whom i have just alluded but it seems that he never meant to do this and only encouraged his uncle to think so because he was not yet ready to give up the shelter he enjoyed with him but of this as i say i was ignorant and was consequently very much astonished when one nightfall in passing the great dudleigh place he remarked how would you like to drink a glass with me in yonder better than in the fairfax kitchen eh i thought he was joking tis a fine old house i observed no doubt its wines are good but it is no tavern and i question if miss dudleigh would make either of us very welcome you do then you dont know miss dudleigh he vaunted with a proud swelling of his person and a lift of his head that almost took my breath away for though he was a handsome fellow too handsome for a man no worthier than he i should no more have presumed to have associated him in my thoughts with miss dudleigh than if he had been a worker in her fields not so much because she was rich very rich for that day and place or that her family was an old one and his but a mushroom stock as that she was a being of the gentlest instincts and the purest thoughts while he was what you may have gathered from my words vain coarse cowardly and mean an abject cur beside her who was and is one of the sweetest women the sun ever shone upon at this expression of admiration on the part of the hermit which proved him to be in entire ignorance of the crime which had been perpetrated against this woman i found myself struck so aghast that i could not forbear showing it but he was too engrossed in his reminiscences to notice my emotion and presently continued his story by saying i probably betrayed my astonishment to urquhart for he gave a great laugh and forced me about toward the gates we will not be turned out he said let us go in and pay our respects but i stammered oh its all right he pursued the fair lady is of age and has the privilege of choosing her future husband i shall live in clover eh well it is time i lived in something i have had a hard enough time of it so far for a none too homely fellow i was overwhelmed more than that i was sickened by these words whose import i understood only too well not that i had any special interest in miss dudleigh indeed i hardly knew her but any such woman inspires respect and i could not think of her as allied to this man without a spasm of revolt that almost amounted to fear you are going to marry her this white rose i exclaimed i should as soon have thought of your marrying a princess of the royal house i hope you appreciate your unbounded good fortune he pointed to the great chimneys and imposing facade of the fine structure before us do you think i am so blind as not to know the advantage of being the master in a house like that you must not think me quite a fool if i am not as clever a fellow as you are remember that i am a poorer one and like my ease better but miss dudleigh oh shes a trifle peaked and dull but shes fond and not too exacting i was angry but had no excuse for showing it righteous indignation he could never have understood and to have provoked a quarrel without any definite end in view would have been folly i remained silent therefore but my heart burned within me it had not lost its heat when we entered her house and when my eyes fell upon her seated at her spinet in front of a latticed window that brought out her gentle figure in all its sweet simplicity i felt like clutching and flinging back over the threshold which his desecrating foot should never have crossed the hollowhearted being at my side who could neither see her beauty nor estimate the worth of her innocent affection there was an aunt or some such relative in the room with her but this did not hinder the glad smile from rising to her lips as she saw us or rather him for she hardly seemed to notice my presence i learned afterward that this aunt had been greatly instrumental in bringing these incongruous natures together that for reasons of her own which i have never attempted to fathom she thought edwin urquhart the best husband that her niece could have and not only introduced him into the house but stood so much his friend during the first days of his courtship that she gradually imparted to her niece her own enthusiasm till the poor girl saw or thought she saw the ideal of her dreams in the base and shallow being whom i called my friend however that may be she certainly rose from her spinet that night in a pretty confusion that made her absolutely lovely and advancing with the mingled dignity of the heiress and the tender bashfulness of the maiden in the presence of him she loved she tendered us a courtesy whose grace put me out of ease with myself so much it expressed the manners of people removed from the sphere in which it had hitherto been my lot to move but urquhart showed no embarrassment his fine figure he had that bent forward with the most courtly of bows and after the introduction of my humble self to her notice he entered into a conversation which if shallow was at least bright and for the moment interesting as i had no wish to talk i gave myself up to watching her and came away at last more fixed than ever in my belief of her extreme worthiness and of his extreme presumption in thinking of calling so perfect a creature his would to god she was as poor as janet fairfax i thought to myself then she would never have attracted his attention and might have known what happiness was with some man who could appreciate her now she is doomed and being fatherless and motherless will rush on to her fate and no one can stop her thus i thought and thus i continued to think as chance and urquharts stubborn will led me more and more to her house and within the radius of her gentle influence but my thoughts never went further i never saw her even in my dreams fostered by me or soothed of an old grief by my love and affection for though she was a dainty and gracious being with beauty enough to delight the eyes and warm the heart she was not the one destined to move me and awake the tumultuous passions that lay dormant in my own scarcely understood nature urquhart therefore was not acting unwisely in taking me there so often though if i could have foreseen what was likely to be the result of those visits i should have leaped from my houses roof on to the stones below before i had passed again under those fatal portals and yet would i do we fear suffering or apathy most is it from experience or the monotony of a commonplace existence that we quickest flee a man with passions like mine must love and if that love comes girt with flame and mysterious death he still must embrace it and rise and fall as the destinies will but i talk riddles i have not yet told you of her and yet speak of fire and death i will try to be more coherent if only to show that the years have brought me some mastery over myself one day it was a fall day and beautiful as limpid sunshine and a world of yellowing woods could make it i went to miss dudleighs house to apologize for my friend who had wished to improve the gorgeous sunshine elsewhere i had by this time lost all fear of her as well as of her rich and spacious surroundings and passed through the hospitable door and along the wide halls to the especial room in which we were wont to find her with that freedom engendered by an intimacy as cordial as it was sincere it was the room where first i had seen her the room with the wide latticed window at the back and the spinet beneath it and the old carven chair of oak in which her whiteclad form had always looked so ethereal and i entered it smiling expecting to see her delicate figure rise from the window and advance toward me with that look of surprise and possible disappointment which the absence of urquhart would be apt to arouse in this too loving nature but the room was empty and the spinet closed and i was about turning to find a servant when i felt an influence stealing over me so subtile and so peculiar that i stood petrified and enthralled hardly knowing if it were music that held me spellbound or some unknown and subduing perfume that filling my senses worked upon my brain and made me feel like a man transported at a breath from the land of reality into a land of dreams so potent the spell so inexplicable its action that minutes may have elapsed before i wrenched myself free from its power and looked to see what it was that so moved me when i did i found myself at a loss to explain it whether it was music or perfume or just the emanation from an intense personality i have never determined i only know that when i turned i saw standing before me in an attitude of waiting a woman of such marvelous attractions and yet of an order of beauty so bizarre and out of keeping with the times and the place in which she stood that i forgot to question everything but my own sanity and the reality of a vision so unprecedented in all my experience i therefore simply stood like her speechless and lost and only came to myself when the figure before me suddenly melted from a statue into a woman and with a deep and graceful courtesy almost daring in its abandonment said you must be master felt i take it master urquhart would never be so thrown off his balance by a simple girl like me there are voices that pierce like arrows and sink deep into the heart which closes over their sweetness forever so it was with this voice from its first sound to its last it held me enthralled and had she shown but half the beauty she did those accents of hers would have made me her slave as it was i was more than her slave i instantly became all and everything to her i breathed but as she breathed and in the absorbing delight which from that moment took hold of me i lost all sense of the proprieties and conventionalities of social intercourse and only thought of drinking in at one draught the strange and mysterious loveliness which i saw revealed before me she was not a tall woman no taller than miss dudleigh nor was she of marked carriage or build her form indeed seemed only made to express suppleness and passion and was as speaking in its slight proportions as if it had breathed forth the nobler attributes of majesty and strength her dress was dark and clung to every curve with a loving persistence bewildering in its effect upon an eye like mine upon the bust and just below the white throat burned a mass of gorgeous flowers as ruddy as wine and from one delicate hand a long vine trailed to the floor but it was in her face that her power lay in her eyes possibly though i scarcely think so for there were curves to her lips such as i have never seen in any other and a delicate turn to her nostril that at times made me feel as if she were breathing fire her skin was pale her forehead broad and low her nose straight and her lips of a brilliant vermilion i however saw only her eyes though i may have been influenced by the rest of her bewildering physiognomy they were so large so changeful so full of alternating flames and languor so indeterminate in color and yet so persistent in their effect upon the eye and the feelings looking at them i swore she was an anomaly gazing into them i resolved that she was this only because she let herself be natural and sought to smother none of the fires which had been enkindled by a bountiful nature within her soul while i was reasoning thus she made me another mock courtesy and explaining her presence by saying she was a cousin of miss dudleighs ventured to remark that if master felt would be kind enough to state his errand she would be glad to carry it to miss dudleigh i answered confusedly but with a fervor she could not fail to understand and following up this effort by another led her into a conversation in which my responses gradually became such as she should expect from a gentleman and an equal for with her notwithstanding her beauty and the sense of splendor and luxury which breathed from her mysterious presence i never felt that sense of personal inferiority i experienced at first with miss dudleigh whether i recognized then as now the lack of those high qualities which lift one mortal above another i do not know i am only certain that while i regarded her as a woman to be obeyed to be loved to be followed through life through death into whatsoever regions of horror danger and pain she might lead me i never looked upon her as a being out of my world or beyond my reach except so far as her caprice might carry her it was therefore with the fixed determination to force from her some of the interest she had awakened in me that i grasped at this first opportunity of conversation and in spite of her unrest she did not want to linger held her to the spot till i had made her feel that a man had come into her life whose will meant something and to whom if she did not subdue the light of her glances she must give account for every added throb she caused to beat in his proud heart this done i let her go for miss dudleigh was not well and needed her and the door closed behind her mysterious smile and the sound of her steps died out in the hall and in fancy only could i behold her supple darkclad form go up the broad staircase projecting itself now against the golden daylight falling through one window and now against the clustering vines that screened another till she disappeared in regions of which i knew nothing and whither even my daring imagination presumed not to follow and the vision never left my eyes nor her form my heart and i went out in my turn a burning eager determined man where in a short half hour before i had entered cold and selfsatisfied without hope and without exaltation this was the beginning in a week the earth and sky held nothing for me but that woman her name which i had not learned at our first interview was marah leighton a fitting watchword for a struggle that could terminate only with my life for i had got to the pass that this woman must be mine i would have her for my wife or see her dead she should never leave the town with another yes homely as i was without recommendation of family or more means than enough to keep a wife from want i boldly entered upon this determination and in the face of some dozen lovers that at the first revelation of her beauty began to swarm about her steps pressed my claims and pushed forward my suit till i finally gained a hearing and after that a promise which if vague was more than any of her other lovers could boast of or why did they all gradually withdraw from the struggle leaving me alone in my homage the uncertainties of her position she was an orphan and dependent upon miss dudleigh for subsistence had added greatly to my tenderness for her it also added to my hope for if i were poor she was poorer and ought to find in the managing of my humble home a satisfaction she could not experience in the enjoyment of a relatives bounty even if that relative was a woman like honora dudleigh and yet one doubts an exultant happiness and as i grew to know her better i realized that if i ever did succeed in making her mine i must see to it that my fortunes bettered as she would never be happy as a poor mans wife even if that man brought her independence and love she loved splendor she loved distinction she loved the frivolities of life not with a childish pleasure or even a girlish enthusiasm but with a womans strong and determined spirit i have seen her pace through and through those great halls just for the pleasure of realizing their spaciousness and though the sight made my heart cringe i have admired her step and the poise of her head as much as if she had been the queen of it all and i her humblest vassal then her luxury it showed as plainly in her poverty as it could have done in wealth if it were flowers she handled it was as a goddess would handle them none were too beautiful or too costly or too rare for her restless fingers to pluck or her dainty feet to tread on had she possessed jewels she would have worn them like roses and flung them away almost as freely if they had displeased her or she had grown weary of them love was to her a jewel and she wore it just now because it suited her fancy to do so but would not the day come when she would grow tired of it or demand another and so fling it and me to the dogs i did not ask i was permitted to walk at her side and pay her my court and now and then when the humor took her to press her hand or drop a kiss upon the rosy palm and while i could do this was it for me to question a future which seemed more likely to hold fewer pleasures than more but i grow diffuse i must return to facts honora dudleigh who saw my devotion encouraged it i wondered at it sometimes for she knew the smallness of my fortune and must have known the nature of the woman i expected to share it but as time passed i wondered less for her womans intuition must have told her what observation had as yet failed to tell me that there was trouble in the air and that marah needed a protector the day that i first recognized this fact made an era in my life i had been so happy so at ease with myself so sure of her growing confidence and of my coming happiness that i had cause for this the conduct of her friends and the jealousy of her lovers seemed to prove though she gave no visible token of her regard she clung to me as to a support and allowed my passion the constant feast of her presence and the stimulation of her voice her enchantments and they were innumerable were never spared me nor did she stint herself of a smile that could allure nor of a glance that could arouse or perplex i was happy and questioned only the extent of my patience which i felt fast giving way as the preparations for miss dudleighs marriage proceeded without my seeing any immediate prospect of my own you can realize then the maddening nature of the shock which i received when coming quietly into the house as i did one day i beheld her face disappearing through one of the doorways with that look upon it which i had always felt was natural to it but which no passion of mine had ever been able to evoke and then perceived in the shadow from which she had just glided edwin urquhart pale as excessive feeling could make him and so shaken by the first real emotion which had ever probably moved his selfish soul that he not only failed to see me when i advanced but hastened by me and away into the solitudes of the garden without noticing my existence or honoring with a reply the words of wrath and confusion which in my misery and despair i threw after him chapter viii a sudden betrothal as for myself continued mark felt i stood crushed and after the first torrent of emotion had swept by lifted my head like a drowning man and looked wildly about as if in the catastrophe which overwhelmed me all nature must have changed and i should find myself in a strange place the sight of the door through which marah leighton had passed stung me into tortured existence again with a roar of passion and hate i sprang toward it burst it open and passed in instantly silence and semidarkness fell upon me through which i felt her presence exhaling its wonted perfume though i could see nothing but the dim shapes of unaccustomed articles of furniture grouped against a window that was almost completely closed from the light of day advancing i gazed upon chair after chair they were all empty and not till i reached the further corner did i find her thrown at full length upon a couch with her head buried in her arms and motionless as any stone confused appalled even for i had never seen her otherwise than erect and mocking i stumbled back and would have fled but that she suddenly arose and flinging back her head gave me one look which i felt rather than saw and bursting into a peal of laughter called me to account for disturbing the first minute of rest she had known that day i was dumfounded if she had consulted all her wiles and sought for the one best way to silence me she could not have chanced on one surer than this i gazed at her quite helpless and forgot actually forgot what had drawn me into her presence and only asked to get a good glimpse of her face which in the dim light was more like that of a spirit than of a woman a mocking spirit in whom no love could lodge whatever my fancy might have pictured in the delirium of the moment that had just passed she seemed to comprehend my mood for she flung back the curtain and drew herself up to her full height before me did you think i was playing the coquette she asked well perhaps i was women like me must have their amusements but oh the languishment in that but i shut my eyes as i heard it i could neither bear its sound nor the sight of her face you listened to him he was making love to you he the promised husband of another and you she forced me to open my eyes and i she repeated with an indescribable emphasis that called up the blushes to my cheek and you i went on answering her demand without hesitation the beloved of an honest man who would die to keep you true and will die if you play him false she sighed softness took the place of scorn she involuntarily held out her hand i was amazed she had never done so much before i seized that hand i pressed it wildly hungrily and with lingering fondness do you not know that you are everything to me i asked that to win you i am ready to do everything barter anything suffer anything but shame you are my fate marah will you not let me be yours she was silent she had drawn her hand from mine and had locked it in its fellow and now stood with them hanging down before her fixed as a statue in a reverie i could neither fathom nor break you are beautiful i went on too beautiful for me but i love you you are proud also and would grace the noblest palaces of the old world but they are far away and my home is near and eager to welcome you you are dainty and have never taught your hands to toil or your feet to walk our common earth but there are affections that sweeten labor and under my roof you will be so honored so aided and so beloved that you will soon learn there are pleasures of the fireside that can compensate for its cares and triumphs of the affections that are beyond the dignities of outside life her lip curled and her hands parted she lifted one rosy palm and looked at it then she glanced at me i shall never work she said my heart contracted but i could not give her up madness as it was to put faith and life in the grasp of such a woman i was too little of a man or too much of a one to turn my back upon a hope which even in its realization could bring me nothing but pain you shall not work i declared and i meant it if i died she should not handle anything harsher than rose leaves in her new home you want me she breathed it i stood in a gasp of hope and fear more than i want heaven or rather you are my heaven we will be married before honora she murmured and gliding from my side before i had recovered from the shock of a promise so unexpected a bliss so unforeseen and immediate she vanished from my sight and nothing but the perfume which lingered behind her remained to tell me that it was not all a dream and i the most presumptuous being alive and so the hour that opened in disaster ended in joy and from the heart of what i deemed an irredeemable disaster rose a hope that for several days put wings to my feet then something began to tarnish my delight an impalpable dread seized me and though i worked with love and fury upon my house which i had begun adorning for my bride i began to question if she had played the coquette in smiling upon edwin urquhart and whether in the mockery of the laugh with which she had dismissed my accusations there had not been some regret for a love she dared not entertain but yet suffered to lose the memory of the glow in her eyes as she turned away from him at my step returned with growing power and i decided that if this were coquetry it were sweeter than love and longed to ask her to play the coquette with me but she never did and though she did not smile upon him again in my presence i felt that her beauty was more bewildering her voice more enchanting when he was in the room with us than when chance or my purpose found us alone to settle my doubts i left watching her and began to watch him and when i found that he betrayed nothing i turned my attention from them both and bestowed it upon miss dudleigh chapter ix marah great heaven why had i not noticed miss dudleigh before in her changed face and in the wasting of her delicate form i saw that my fears were not all vain inasmuch as they were shared by her and shocked at evidences so much beyond my expectations i knew not whether to shed the bitter tears which rose to my eyes in pity for her or in rage for myself we were sitting all together and i had a full opportunity to observe the mournful smile that now and then crossed her lips as marah uttered some brighter sally than common or broke as she often did into song that rippled for a minute through the heavy air and then ceased as suddenly as it had begun she looked much oftener at marah than at urquhart and seemed to be asking in what lay the charm that subdued everybody even herself and when she seemed to receive no answer to her secret questioning her eyes fell and a sigh stirred her lips which if unheard by the preoccupied man at her side rang on in my ears long after i had bidden farewell to her and the siren whose smiles intentionally or unintentionally seemed destined to bring shipwreck into three lives it was not the last time i heard that sigh as the weeks progressed it fluttered oftener and oftener from between those pale lips and at last the change in miss dudleigh became so marked that people stopped in the midst of their talk about the stamp act to remark upon miss dudleighs growing weakness and venture assertions that she would never live to be a bride and yet the preparations for her bridal and for mine went on and the day set apart for the latter drew bewilderingly near marah saw my perplexity and her cousins grief but did nothing to dispel the one or assuage the other she seemed to be too busy she was embroidering a famous stomacher for herself and while a sprig of it remained unworked she had neither eyes nor attention for anything else even for the bleeding hearts around her she would smile o yes smile upon me smile upon honora and not smile upon him but she would not meet her cousins true eyes nor would she grant me one minute apart from the rest in which i could utter my fears or demand the breaking of that spell whose effects were so visible even if its workings were secret and imperceptible but at last the stomacher was finished and as it dropped from her hands i threw myself at her feet and from this position looking into her eyes i whispered this is the last thing that shall ever flaunt itself between us you are to be mine now and in token of your truth come with me into the conservatory for i have words to utter that will not be put off you are cruel she murmured you are tyrannical this is a time of revolt shall i revolt too maddened for her eyes were not looking at me but at him i leaped to my feet and regardless of everything but my determination to end this uncertainty then and there i lifted her and carried her out of the room into another where i could have her alone and without the humiliating sense of his presence illustration my bold act seemed to frighten her for she stood very still where i had placed her only trembling slightly when i looked at her and cried did you ask that question of me am i to understand you want to break your fetters she plucked a rose from her breast and crumpled it to atoms between her hands o why are they not golden ones she asked i am miserable because we must be poor because because i want to ride in a carriage because i want to wear jewels and own a dozen servants and trample on the pride of women plainer than myself i hate your humble home i hate your stiff dutch kitchen i hate your sordid ways and the decent respectability that is all you can offer me were you beautiful as adonis it would make no difference i was born to drink wine and not water and i shall never forgive you for forcing me to take your crystal goblet in my hands while if i had waited she stopped panting i let my whole pentup jealousy out in a word edwin urquhart has not even a crystal goblet to offer you he is poorer than i am and will remain so till he has actually married miss dudleigh dont i know it she flashed out if it had been otherwise do you think she had the grace or the wisdom to falter i regret it now i regret that she did not go on and reveal her whole soul to me in one fell burst of feeling as it was i trembled with jealousy and passion but i did not cast her from me then you acknowledge i cried but she would acknowledge nothing i love no one she asserted no one i want what i want but none of you can give it to me then blame me as you will i took a great resolve i determined to give her what she craved convinced of her sordid nature convinced of her heartlessness and the folly of ever thinking she could even understand much less reciprocate my passion i was so much under her sway at that moment that i would have flung at her feet kingdoms had i possessed them flushing i seized her hand you do not know what a man in love can do i cried trust me give me yourself as you have promised and sooner or later i will give you what you have asked i am not a weak man or an incompetent one politics opens a vast field to an ambitious nature and if war breaks out as we all expect it will you will see me rise to the front if i have you for my wife and inspiration the scorn in her eyes did not abate o you men she cried you think you give us everything with a promise a war what is the history of wars demolished homes broken fortunes rack ruin and desolation is there gold or honor or ease in these a war it will not be a war it will be a struggle in which men will fight barefoot and on empty stomachs for the privilege of calling themselves free i have no sympathy with such a war it robs us of comfort in the present and brings nothing worth waiting for in the future were i to have my will i would take the arm of the first officer returning to england and remain there i hate this country so new so crude so democratic i should like to live where i could ride over the necks of common people a tory and an aristocrat another gulf between us i looked at her in horror but alas the horror was strangely mixed with admiration she was such a burning embodiment of pride her peculiar beauty the source of which i have never to this day been able to fathom lent itself so readily to the expression of fury and disdain that recoil as i would from her principles i could not shut my eyes to the fascination of her glance or the torturing charm that hid in the corners of her pouting lips she was a queen oh yes but the queen of some strange realm in a distant oriental land where right and wrong were only words and the sole end of beauty was delight without reference to god or ones fellows i saw it all i felt it all yet i lingered she was to be my wife in three days and the intoxication of this prospect was in my blood and brain you will do so and so were her next words you will give me what i ask when you have won it but i cannot wait for the winning i want it now do you know what i would do to get the wealth i was born to i would risk life i would walk on burning plowshares i would she stopped and i saw the lines come out in her forehead she was thinking thinking deeply i felt the shadow of a great horror creeping over me i caught her impetuously in my arms i kissed her passionately to drive away the demons i begged and implored her to forget her evil thoughts and be the woman i could love and cherish and finally i moved her she shook herself free but she also shook the shadow from her brow she even found a smile to bestow upon me and was it a tear could it have been a tear i saw for a moment glisten in her eye as she turned half petulantly half imperiously away i have never known but the very suspicion filled my heart to overflowing and the great sobs rose in my breast and fool that i was i was about to beg her pardon when she gave me one other look and i merely faltered out where will you find another love like mine marah if you got your gold you would soon miss something which only comes with love you would be unhappy and curse the day you left my arms i am your master marah why not make me a happy one i expect she murmured to marry you and then i could not help it the words sprang to my lips involuntarily her eyes opened wide she literally flashed them upon me i felt their lightnings play all about my doubtful nature and scorch it i will be your wife she uttered gravely i fell at her feet i kissed the hem of her robe in that moment i adored her o best and fairest i cried i will make you happy i will fill your hopes to the full you shall ride in a carriage and your will shall be a law to those who smile in scorn upon you now and you will be mistress felt of most honorable degree she finished with the half laughing disdain she could never keep long out of her words and thus i became again her slave and lived in that sweet if servile condition till the hour of our nuptials came and i went to conduct her to the church where in sight of half the town she was to be made my wife shall i ever forget that morning it was a december day but the heavens were blue and the earth white and not a cloud bespoke a rising storm as for me i walked on air all the more that i knew urquhart was out of town and would not be present at the wedding he had gone away on some behest of miss dudleighs immediately after the last interview i have mentioned and would not come back or so i had been told till after miss leighton had been mistress felt for a week so there was nothing to mar my day or make my entrance into miss dudleighs house anything but one of promise i saw miss dudleigh first she was standing in the vast colonial hall when i entered and in her gala robes and with the sunshine on her head she looked almost happy yet she was greatly changed from her old self and i felt much like pouring out my soul to her and bidding her to break a tie that would never bring her peace or even honor but i feared to shatter my own hopes selfish being that i was i dreaded to have her made free lest what my thoughts did not interpret my fears for at that moment a sunbeam struck down the stairs and through my heart and looking up i saw marah descending and thought and reason flew to greet her she had been robed by her cousins bounteous hand and her dress of stiff yellow brocade burned in the morning light with almost as much brilliance as the sunshine itself folded across her bust was the wonderful stomacher under whose making i had suffered so many emotions that each sprig of work upon it seemed to have its own tale of misery for my eyes and fixed against this and her white throat were those masses of flowers without which her beauty never seemed quite complete in her hair which was piled high above her forehead flashed a huge golden comb and upon her arm gleamed two bracelets whose exquisite workmanship was well known to me for they had been an heirloom in my family for years she was fair as a dream proud as a queen cold as a statue but she was mine was not the minister waiting for us at the church and were not the horses that were to take us there even now champing their bits before the door she rode with me four white horses had been attached to miss dudleighs coach and behind these we passed in state out through the noble park that separated this lordly house from the rest into the closely packed streets where hundreds waited to catch a glimpse of the most beautiful woman in albany going to be made a bride miss dudleigh rode behind us in another coach and the murmur which greeted our appearance did not die out till after she had passed for they knew she would soon be riding the same road with even greater state if not with so much beauty and the people of albany loved honora dudleigh for she was ever a beneficent spirit to them and more than ever since a shadow had fallen upon her happiness and she had come to know what misery was and thus we passed on marah with a glowing flush of triumph burning on her cheek and i in one of those moods of happiness whose rapture was so unalloyed that i scarcely heard the halflaughing comments of those who saw with wonder how plain was the man who had succeeded in carrying off this wellknown beauty and the greater part of the way was traversed and the bells of the old north church became audible and in a moment more we should have seen the belfry of the church itself rising before us when suddenly the woman that i loved the woman whose nuptials the minister was waiting to celebrate gave a great start and turning quickly toward me cried turn the horses heads i do not go to the church with you today not if you kill me mark felt you have heard of stray bullets coming singing from some unknown quarter and striking a person seated at a feast such a bullet struck me then i looked at her in horror chapter x at the foot of the stairs you think i am playing with you she murmured i am not i have sickened of these nuptials and am going back if you want to you may kill me where i sit you carry a dagger i know one more red blossom will not show on my breast give it to me if you will but turn the horses she meant it however much my lost heart might cry out for its happiness and honor leaning forward i told the pompous driver that miss leighton had been taken very ill and bade him drive back and then with the calmness born of utter despair and loss i said to her in pity for my pride drop your head upon my shoulder i have said you were sick and sick you must be it is the least you can do for me now she obeyed me that head on which in fancy i had set the crowns of empires for whose every hair my heart had given a throb sank coldly down till it rested upon the heart she had broken and while i steadied my nerves to meet the changed faces of the crowd the carriage gave a sudden turn and amid murmurings that fell almost unheeded on my benumbed senses we wheeled about and faced again the gates through which we had so lately issued she is ill i shouted to miss dudleigh as we passed her carriage but she gave me no reply she was gazing over the heads of the crowd at some distant object that enthralled her every look and sense and moved by her expression as i thought never to be moved by anything again i followed her glance and there on the outskirts of the crowd crouching amid branches that yet refused to hide him i saw edwin urquhart and the miserable truth smote home to my heart that it was he who had stopped my marriage he whom i had thought far distant but who had now come to hinder by some secret gesture or glance my bride on her path to the altar a dagger was hidden in my breast and i still wonder that i did not leap from the carriage burst through the crowd and slay him where he crouched in cowardly ambush but i let the moment go by perhaps because i dreaded to bring the shadow of another woe into miss dudleighs white face and almost immediately the throng had surged in thickly between us and miss dudleighs carriage had turned after ours and there was nothing further to do but to ride back with the false face pressed in seeming insensibility to my breast and that false heart beating out its cold throbs of triumph upon mine i bore it glancing down but once upon her had the ride before me been one of miles i should have gone on in the same mechanical way for my very being was petrified rage fear sorrow and despair all seemed like dreams to me i wondered that i had ever felt anything and stared on and on at the blue sky before me conscious of but one haunting thought that repeated itself again and again in my brain that her power lay not in her eyes as i had always been assured but in those strange curves about her mouth for her eyes were closed now and yet i was coldly conscious of the fact that she had never looked more beautiful or more fitted to move a man if a man had any heart left to be moved the stopping of the carriage before the great door of miss dudleighs house roused me to the necessity for action i must carry you in i whispered i beg your pardon for it but it is necessary to the farce and following up my words by action i lifted her from the seat cold and unresponsive as a stone and carried her into the house and set her down before the astonished eyes of such servants as had remained to guard the house in our absence miss leighton has not been married i cried she was taken ill on the way to church and i have brought her back she needs no attendance and i waved them all back for their startled gaping countenances infuriated me and threatened to shatter the dreadful calmness which was my only strength as they disappeared murmuring and peering miss dudleigh entered i gave her one glance and dropped my eyes she and i could not bear each others looks yet meantime marah stood erect in the center of the hall her face pale her lips set her eyes fixed upon vacancy not a word passed our three mouths at last a petulant murmur broke the dreadful silence and marah tossing her head in disdain turned away before our eyes and began to mount the stairs i felt my blood which for many minutes had seemed at a standstill pour with a rush through vein and artery and darting to her side i caught her by the hand and held her to her place you shall not go up i cried till you and i have understood each other you have refused to marry me today was it some caprice that moved you or i paused and looked behind me miss dudleigh had shrunk from sight into one of the rooms or because you saw edwin urquhart in the crowd and followed his commanding gesture the hand which i held grew cold as ice she drew it away and looked at me haughtily but i saw that i had frightened her edwin urquhart is nothing to me came in low but emphatic tones from her lips i did not want to marry any one and i said so it would be better if more brides hesitated on the threshold of matrimony instead of crossing it to their ruin i could have killed her but i subdued myself i knew that i had lost her that in another moment she would be gone never to enter my presence again as my promised wife but i uttered no word honored her with no glance merely made her a low bow and stepped back as i thought master of myself again but in that final instant one last arrow entered my breast and darting back to her side i whispered in what must have been a terrible voice go falsest of the false i have done with you but if you have lied to me if you think to trip up edwin urquhart in his duty and break honora dudleighs noble heart and shame my honor i will kill you as i would a snake in the grass you shall never approach the altar with another as nearly as you have this day with me and with the last mockery of a look in which every detail of her beauty flashed with almost an unbearable insistence upon my eyes i turned my back upon her and strode toward the outer door chapter xi honora but i did not pass it a sound struck my ear it was that of a smothered sob and it came from the room where i had first seen miss dudleigh instantly a vision of that sweet form bowed in misery struck upon my still palpitating heart and moved at a grief i knew to be well nigh as bitter as my own i stopped before the halfclosed door and gently pushed it open miss dudleigh at once advanced to meet me tears were on her cheeks but she walked very firmly and took my hand with an inquiry in her soft eyes that almost drove me distracted what shall i do i cried to myself tell this woman to beware or leave her to fight her battles alone no answer came from my inmost soul i was appalled by her weakness and my own selfishness and bowed my head and said nothing a strange ending to the hopes of this day were the words that thereupon fell from her lips is is marah ill or did one of her strange moods overtake her i do not understand miss leighton i replied the time i have spent in the study of her character has been wasted i shall never undertake to open the book again then she faltered and an absolute terror grew in her eyes you are going to leave her she is going to be free and the white cheeks grew scarlet she evidently feared that she had shown me her heart affected but irresolute still i took her hand and carried it to my lips let me thank you said i for glimpses into a nature so noble and womanly that i am saved in this hour from cursing all womankind ah how she sighed you are good she murmured you have deserved a better fate but it is the lot of goodness and truth ever to meet with misappreciation and disdain here here only and she struck her breast with her clenched right hand lie the rewards for honesty longsuffering and tenderness in the world without there is nothing tears which i could not restrain welled up to my eyes i could never have wept for my own suffering but for hers it seemed both natural and real ah why had she thrown the treasures of her heart away upon a fool why had she given the trust of her heart to a villain i opened my lips to speak she saw his name faltering on my tongue and stopped me dont she breathed i know what you would say and i cannot bear it i was motherless fatherless almost friendless and i relied upon the wisdom of an aunt whose judgment was perhaps not all that it should have been but it is too late now for regrets i have launched my boat and it must sail on only you are an honest man and will respect my confidence was it mr urquhart i saw on the outskirts of the crowd today i bowed i knew she had not asked because she had any doubts as to the fact of his being there but because she wanted to see if i had recognized him and owed any of my misery to that fact it was he said i and said no more the mask fell from her countenance she clasped her hands together till they showed white as marble oh we are four miserable ones she cried he it was my turn to stop her i would rather you did not say it i exclaimed i can bear much but not to hear another person utter words that will force me to think of the dagger i carry always in my breast besides we may be mistaken i did not believe it but i forced myself to say it she declares he is nothing to her and if that is so you might wish to have kept silent she says ah can you believe her do you i must or go mad then i will believe her too i am so slightly tied to this world that has deceived me that i will trust on a little while longer even if my trust lands me in my grave i had rather die than discover deceit where i had looked for honesty and gratitude i was a coward perhaps but i did not try to dissuade her though she was fatherless and motherless and loverless and friendless i let her grasp at this wisp of hope and cling to it though i knew it would never hold and that her only chance for happiness was passing from her if he were not poor she now breathed rather than whispered i would find it easier to rend myself free but he has nothing but what lies in my future and if i should make a mistake and do injustice to a man that is merely suffering under a temporary intoxication i should rob him of his only hope without adding one chance to my own i bowed and made a movement toward the door i could not stand much more of this strain you are going she cried well i cannot keep you but that dagger you will promise me to throw it away you do not need it in defense and you do not want to kill me before my time no no i did not want to kill her grief was doing that fast enough so i thought at that time shuddering but resolute i drew the tiny steel from my breast and laid it in her hand it is all i can give you to show you my appreciation of your goodness and not trusting myself to linger longer lest i should take it again from her hand i went out and walked hastily from the house if you asked me what road i took or through what streets i passed or whose eye i encountered in my next hours walking through the town i could not tell you if jeers followed me i heard them not if i was the recipient of sympathizing looks and wondering conjectures they were all lost upon eyes that were blind and ears that were deaf i did not even feel and did not realize till night that i had been wandering for hours without my cloak which i had left in the carriage and forgotten to take again when i went out the first knowledge i had of my surroundings was when i found an obstruction in my path and looking up saw myself in front of my own door and not two feet from me edwin urquhart chapter xii edwin urquhart in that moment mark felt paused and cast a glance toward the hudson far below us then he resumed his narrative i drew back he said and clenched my hands to keep myself from strangling urquhart then i broke into hurried pants that subsided gradually into words of perplexity and amazement as i met his eye and realized that it contained nothing but a rude sort of sympathy and good fellowship how why what do you mean by coming back i cried you said you would be gone a week you swore a gay laugh interrupted me and must a man keep every oath he makes especially when it separates him from a charming betrothed and a friend who swore that he would make this day his wedding one urquhart felt are you a monster or are you a selfpossessed man who is going to take in charge a crazy one come into the house mark a dozen eyes can see us here he took me in charge he piloted me into my own dwelling he whose whole body i had always esteemed weaker than my little finger my enemy too or so i considered him the cause of half my grief of all my shame the beginning and end of my hatreds when we were closeted as we soon were in the room i had expended so much upon to make worthy of my bride he came and stood before me and uttered these unexpected words felt i like you you are the only friend i have and i am indebted to you now what have you against me i was astonished his whole look and bearing were so different from what i had expected so different from anything i had ever seen in him before i began to question my doubts and dropped my eyes as he pursued you have been disappointed in your marriage i hear but that need not make you as downcast as this a woman as capricious as miss leighton might easily imagine she was too ill to go through the ceremony today but she must have repented of her folly by this time and in a week will reward you as your patience deserves but what have i got to do with it for incredible as it appears your every look and tone assures me that you blame me for this mishap was he daring me if so he should find me his equal i raised my eyes and surveyed him shall i tell you why this is so why i associate miss leightons caprice with your return and regard both with suspicion because i have seen you look on her with love because i have surprised the passion in your face and beheld her well the tone was indescribable it was as if a hand had taken me by the throat and choked me i drew off and was silent he seized the word at once you have seen nothing if you think you have then have you deceived yourself marah leighton has beauty but it is not a kind that moves me he paled was it horror of the lie he was uttering i have never known never shall know the woman i am going to marry is honora dudleigh i gazed at him determined to find the truth if it were in him he bore my look unflinchingly though his color did not return and his hands trembled nervously you love her i asked i love her he returned and your wedding day is set may it have no interruptions i remarked he laughed an uneasy laugh i thought but jealousy was not yet dead within me and yours he inquired i have had mine i returned i shall never have another he shook his head and looked at me inquisitively i repeated my assertion i shall never approach the altar again with a woman i am done with such things and done with love he finished his laugh wait till you see marah leighton smile again he cried and with the first reappearance of his old manner that i had seen in him since the beginning of this interview he caught up a wine glass off the table and filling it with wine exclaimed jovially heres to our future wives may they be all that love paints them i thought his mirth indecent his manner out of keeping with the occasion and the whole situation atrocious but i saw he was about to leave and said nothing but i did not drink his toast when he was gone i broke his glass by flinging it at my own reflection in a glass i had bought to mirror her beauty and before the day was spent i had destroyed every destructible article in the house whose value or whose prettiness spoke of the attempt i had made to alter my home from a bachelors abode to the nest i had thought in keeping with the dove i had failed to place there as i did it i filled the house with mocking laughter that i should have thought that this or that would please her who would have found a palace open to criticism and the splendors of a throne room scarce grand enough for her taste i was but suffering the stings of a lifetime compressed into a day and was miserable because i could see no prospect but further addition to my suffering chapter xiii before the wedding two weeks after this i was sitting beside my solitary hearth musing upon my misery and longing for the blessed relief of sleep there was no one with me in the house i had dismissed every servant for i would have no spies about me prying into my misery and though i could not keep the world of men and women from my doors i could at least refuse to admit them and this i did living the life of a recluse almost as much as i do here but with less ease because the wind would bring whispers and the walls were not thick enough to shut out from my fancy the curious glances i felt to be cast upon them by every passerby that wandered through the street on this night i had been thinking of miss dudleigh of whose visibly failing health various murmurs had reached me and i felt notwithstanding my determination to hold myself aloof from every one and everything that could in any way reopen my still smarting wound i could more easily find the sleep i longed for if some word from the great house would relieve the suspense in which my ignorance kept me but i would not go there if i died of my anxiety nor would i stoop to question any of the market men or women who were the only persons admitted now within my doors the clock was striking and the strange sense of desolation which is inseparable from this sound to a solitary man you see i have no clock here was stealing over me when i heard a tap on one of the windows overlooking my small garden and a voice came through the lattice crying massa massa felt i knew the voice at once it was that of one of miss dudleighs servants an honest black who had always been devoted to me from the day he did me some trifling service with miss leighton hearing it now and after such thoughts i was so moved by the promise it gave of news from the one quarter i desired that i stumbled as i rose and found difficulty in answering him nor did i recover my selfpossession for hours for the story he had to tell after numerous apologies for his presumption in disturbing me was so significant of coming evil that my mind was thrown again into turmoil and the passions which i had tried to smother were roused again into action it was simply this that one evening after mr urquharts departure and the extinguishing of all the lights in the house he had occasion to cross the garden that in doing this he had heard voices and stepping cautiously forward perceived lying upon the snowcovered ground near a certain belt of evergreens the shadows of two persons whose forms were hidden from his sight being both curious and concerned he halted before coming too close and listening heard mr urquharts voice and presently that of miss leighton both speaking very earnestly will you undertake it can you go through with it without shrinking was what the former had said i will undertake it and i can go through with it was what the latter had replied frightened at a discovery which might mean nothing and which might mean misery to a mistress the day of whose marriage was scarcely a month away the negro held his breath determined to hear more he was immediately rewarded by catching the words you are a brave girl and my queen and then something like a prayer for a kiss or some such favor as a seal to their compact but to this she returned a vigorous no followed by the mysterious sentence i shall give you nothing till i am dead and then i will give you everything after which they made a move as if to separate which action so alarmed the now deeply disconcerted negro that he drew back in haste hiding behind some neighboring bushes till they had passed him and disappeared he out of the gate and she through the small side entrance into the house this was the previous night and for nearly twentyfour hours the poor negro had tortured himself as to what he should do with the information thus surreptitiously gained he lacked the courage to tell his mistress and finally he had thought of me who was her best friend and who must have known there was something amiss with miss leighton or why had i not married her when everything was ready and the minister waiting with his book in his hand not answering this insinuation i put to him one or two of the many questions that were burning in my brain had he told any of the other servants what he had seen and did miss dudleigh look as if she suspected there was anything wrong he answered that he had not dared to speak a word of it even to his wife and as for miss dudleigh she was ill so much of the time that it was hard to tell whether she had any other cause for uneasiness or not he only knew that she was greatly changed since this miserable deceiver came into the house i believed him and amid all my struggle and wrath tried to fix my mind upon her alone i succeeded only partially but enough to enable me to write this line which i entreated him to carry to her honored miss dudleigh you will forgive me if i overstep the bounds of friendship in yielding to the inner voice which compels me to say that if before or on your marriage day you need advice or protection you may command both from your respectful servant mark felt i did not expect a reply to this note and i did not receive any i thought i went as far as my position toward her allowed but i have questioned it since questioned if i should not have told her what the negro had heard and seen and let her own judgment decide her fate but i was not in my right mind in those days i was too much a part of all this misery to be a fair judge of my own duty and then the mysterious nature of miss leightons remark the incomprehensibility of the words i shall give you nothing till i am dead and then i shall give you everything added such unreality to the scene and awakened such curious conjectures that i did not know where any of us stood or to what especial misery the future pointed till she was dead what could she what did she mean she would then give him everything ah ah when she was dead well so be it meanwhile there was no prospect of death for any one unless it was for miss dudleigh whom rumor acknowledged to be still fading though everything was being done for her comfort and physician after physician employed i saw cжsar once again in these days i met him in the street seemingly greatly to his delight for he smiled till his teeth shone from ear to ear and made haste to remark in quite a jovial voice i specs its all right massa massa urquhart never looks at miss leighton now but always doin his best for missus making her smile quite happy when she isnt coughing that dreadful cough we will have a gay wedding yet yes miss leighton seems to spect that for she all de time making pretty things and trying them on missus and laughing and cheering her up just as if she didnt spect any one to die yes but this change of manner frightened me i grew feverishly anxious and spent night and day in asking myself unanswerable questions nor did these in any way abate when one day i was startled by the tidings that all preparations for refitting the great house had stopped that the doctors had decided that miss dudleigh must remove to a warmer climate and that accordingly upon her marriage she and her husband would set sail for the bermudas there to take up their abode till her health was quite restored i doubted my ears i doubted the facts i doubted urquhart and i doubted one other most of all whose name i find it hard to mention even to myself yet i should not have doubted her i should have remembered the flame that was always burning in the depths of her eyes and had confidence in that if in nothing else what if she had always been cold to me she was not cold to him and i should have known this and prepared myself but i did not i knew neither the extent of his villainy nor that of her despair had i done so i might not have been crouching here a disappointed and hopeless man while she but i am running beyond my tale after the news i had just imparted i heard nothing more till the very week of the wedding then one of miss dudleighs servants came to me with a note the result of which was that i walked out in the afternoon and that she passed me in her carriage and seeing me stopped the horses and took me in and that we rode on a short distance together i wish to talk to you she said i wish to proffer you a request to beg of you a favor i want you she stammered and her eyes filled with tears to see me married i opened my eyes with a quick denial but i closed them again without speaking after all why not please her could i suffer more at this wedding than in thinking over it in my dungeon of a room at home she would be there of course but i need not look at her and if he or she meditated any treachery where ought i to be but in the one place where my presence would be most useful i decided to gratify miss dudleigh almost before the inquiry in her eyes had changed to a look of suspense yes i will come said i she drew a deep breath and smiled with tender sweetness i thank you she rejoined i thank you most deeply and most truly i do not know why i desired it so much possibly because i feel something like a sister to you possibly because i feel afraid she stopped blushing i do not mean afraid why should i feel afraid edwin is very good to me very good i did not know he could be so attentive and she sighed i felt that sigh go through and through me looking at her i took a sudden resolution honora i said i had never called her by her first name before do not give your happiness into edwin urquharts keeping you have yet three days before you for reconsideration break your bonds and unhampered by uncongenial ties seek in another climate for that peace of mind you will never enjoy here or elsewhere as his wife she stared at me for a moment with wideopen and appealing eyes then she shook her head and answered quietly one brokenoff wedding in the family is enough i cannot shock society with another but oh mark why did you not warn me at first i think i would have listened i think so forgive me i entreated you know it would have been presumptuous in me at first afterward she stood in the way i know she answered and turned away her head i saw she did not wish me to leave her yet so i said you are going away you are going to leave albany i must or so edwin thinks he says i will never recover in this climate do you wish to go yes i think i do i can never be happy here and perhaps when we are far away and have only each other to think of the love and confidence of which i have dreamed may come at all events i comfort myself with that hope but it is a long long sea voyage have you strength enough to carry you through if i have not she intimated with a mournful smile he will be free and i released without scandal from a marriage that fills you with apprehension oh i cried would i were your brother indeed this should never go on then impelled by what i thought to be my duty i inquired and your money honora she flushed but answered in the same spirit in which i had spoken as little of it as may be will remain with him that much my old guardian insisted upon do not ask me any more questions mark none of a nature so personal i promised but there is one thing can you not guess what it is which i ought to know it is about marah the words came with effort and hurt her as much as me but she answered bravely she returns to schenectady the same day that we depart i hoped she would not linger to the wedding but she seems to have a strange desire to face again the people who have talked about her so freely these last few weeks so what can i say to dissuade her let her stay i muttered but let her beware how she behaves on that day for there will be two eyes watching her prompt to see any treachery and prompt too to avenge it you will have nothing to avenge murmured honora that is all in the past i prayed to heaven she might be right and ere long bowed in adieu and left her i saw neither herself nor any one else again till i entered the dudleigh mansion three days later to witness her nuptials chapter xiv a cassandra at the gate miss dudleigh moved perhaps by the unpleasant eclat which had followed the brokenoff marriage of her cousin chose to celebrate her own wedding in her own house and with as little ceremony as possible only her most intimate friends therefore were invited but these were numerous enough to fill the halls and most of the lower rooms when i entered there was a sudden cessation of conversation but this i had expected if anything could add to the interest of the occasion certainly it was my presence and feeling this i made them all a profound obeisance and neither shirking their glances nor inviting them i took my place in the spot i had chosen for myself and waited with a face as impassive as a mask but with a heart burning with fury and love not for the coming of the bride but of her who in this hour ought to have been standing at my side as my wife but i miscalculated if i thought she would enter with them even her bold and arrogant spirit shrank from a position so conspicuous and it was not till they had presented themselves and taken their places in front of the latticed window so associated with my past that i felt that peculiar sensation which always followed the entrance of marah into the same room with myself and yielding to the force that constrained me i searched the throng with eager looks and there where the crowd was thickest and the shadow deepest i saw her she was gazing straight at me and there was in her great eyes a look which i did not then understand and about which i have since tortured myself by asking again and again if it were remorse entreaty farewell or despair that spoke through it sometimes i have thought it was fear sometimes but why conjecture it was an unreadable expression to me then and even in remembrance it is no clearer whatever it betokened my pride bent before it and a flood of the old feeling rushed over my heart making me quite weak for a moment but i conquered myself as far as all betrayal of my feelings was concerned and turning from the spot that so enthralled me i fixed my gaze upon the bride she was looking beautiful more beautiful than any one had seen her look for weeks a bright color suffused her delicate cheeks and in her eyes burned a strange excitement which did the work of happiness in lighting up her face but it was a transient glow which faded imperceptibly but surely as the ceremony proceeded and passed completely away as the last inexorable words were uttered which made her the wife of the false being at her side he on the contrary was pale up to that same critical moment very pale when one remembers his naturally florid complexion but as her color went his rose and when the minister withdrew and friends began to crowd around them he grew so jovial and so noisy that more than one person glanced at him with suspicion and cast pitying looks at the now quiet and immobile young wife meantime i sought with eager anxiety to catch one more glimpse of marah but she had shrunk from sight and was not to be found and the gayety ran high and the wine was poured freely and the bridegroom drank with everincreasing excitement toasting his bride but never looking at her though her eyes turned more than once upon him with an appeal that affected painfully more than one person in the crowd at last she rose and at this signal he put down his glass and with a low bow to the company prepared to follow her from the room they passed close to the place where i stood and i caught one glance from his eyes it was a laughing one but there was uneasiness in it there might have been something more but i had not time to search for it for at that moment i felt her dress brush against my sleeve and turned to give her the smile which i knew her friendly heart demanded you will wait till we go fell in a whisper from her lips and i nodded with another smile and they went on and i stood where they had left me in one of those moods which made me as far as all human intercourse is concerned as much of an isolated being as i am in these mountains i did not wake again from this abstraction till that same premonitory feeling of which i have so often spoken told me that something in which i was deeply interested was about to happen looking up i found myself in the room alone during the hour of my abstraction the guests had gone out and i had neither noticed their departure nor the gradual cessation of the noise which at one time had filled my ears with hubbub but the bride had not gone she was at that moment coming down the stairs and it was this fact which had pierced to my inner consciousness and aroused once more in me a vivid sense of my surroundings he was with her and behind them gliding like a wraith from landing to landing came marah clad like the bride in a traveling dress but without the bonnet which betokened an instant departure not anticipating her presence so near i felt my courage fail and pushing forward joined the group of servants at the door they seeing in this departure of their mistress a possibly endless separation were weeping and uttering exclamations that not only showed their devotion but their fears shocked lest these words should reach her ears i quieted them and then seeing that the carriage which stood outside had a stranger for a driver and that there was no accompanying wagon filled with their body servants and baggage i asked the friendly cжsar who had pressed close to my side if mrs urquhart was not going to take a maid with her the negro at once growled out an injured no and when i expressed my astonishment he explained that there was no one here good enough to please massa urquhart that he was going to pick up with some one in new york that though missus was sick he would not even let her have her own gal go wid her as far as the city said he would do everything for her hisself as if any man could do for missus like her own sally who had been wid her ever since fore she was born and the baggage i asked troubled more than i can say by what certainly augured anything but favorably for her future oh massa send dat round to his house he got books an a lot o things to add to it deres enough o dat an den more went down de ribber on a sloop a week an more ago so so and they are going to ride yes sah you see dey want to catch de ship wat set sail for bermudas an got to hurry so massa says by this time urquhart and his bride had reached the door he was still gay and she was still quiet but in her eye glistened a tear while in his there gleamed nothing softer than that vague spark of triumph which one might expect to see in a man who had just married the richest heiress in albany goodby goodby goodby came in soft tones from her lips and she was just stepping over the threshold when there suddenly appeared at the foot of the steps an old crone so seamed and bowed with age so weird and threatening of aspect that we all started back appalled and were about to draw mrs urquhart out of her path when the unknown creature raised her voice and pointing with one skinny hand straight into the brides face shrieked beware of oak walls beware of oak walls they are more dangerous to you than fire and water beware of oak walls a shriek interrupted her it came not from the bride but from the interior of the wellnigh forsaken hall behind us instantly the old crone drew herself up into an attitude more threatening and more terrible than before illustration and you she cried pointing now beyond us toward a figure which i could feel shrinking in inexplicable terror against the wall and you cannot trust them either there is death within oak walls beware beware a curse a rush and edwin urquhart had flung himself at the old witchs throat but he fell to the pavement without touching her with the utterance of her last word she had slipped from before our eyes and melted into the crowd which curiosity and interest had drawn within the gates to watch this young couples departure who was that creature let me have her give her up i say leaped from the infuriated bridegrooms lips as he rushed up and down before the crowd with threatening arms and flashing eyes but there was no response from the surging throng while from his frightened wife such an appealing cry rung out that he returned from the vain pursuit and regaining his place at honoras side put her into the carriage but as he did so he could not refrain from casting a stealthy look behind him which betrayed to me if to no one else that his anger was more on account of the words uttered to marah than to the tender being clinging to his arm and a jealous fury took hold of me also and i should not have been sorry if i had seen him fall then and there the victim of a thunderbolt more certain if not more terrible than that which had just overwhelmed the two women nearest to our hearts goodby goodby goodby came again from the brides pale lips and this time i felt that the words were for me and i waved my hand in response but could not speak and so they rode away followed by the lamentations of the servants from whom the old crones ominous outburst had torn the last semblance of selfcontrol another carriage for miss leighton i now heard uttered somewhere like a command and startled at the pang it caused me i darted back into the house determined to have one parting word with my lost love she was not there nor could she be found by any searching chapter xv the catastrophe i have but little more to tell mark felt continued but that little is everything to me when we became positively assured that miss leighton had disappeared from the house and would not be on hand to take the stage to schenectady the excitement which had been increasing on all sides since the ceremony culminated and the whole town was set agog to find her if only to solve the mystery of a nature whose actions had now become inexplicable i was the first to start the pursuit haunted by her last look and thrilled to every extremity by the terror of the shriek she had uttered i did not wait for the alarm to become public but rushed immediately up stairs at the first intimation of her disappearance though i had never pierced those regions before my good or evil fate took me at once to a room which i saw at one glance to be hers the boxes waiting to be carried down the tags and ends of ribbons that i recognized the nameless something which speaks of one particular personality and no other all were there to assure me that i stood in the chamber which for six months or more had palpitated with the breath of the one being i loved but of that i dared not think it was no time for dreams and only stopping to see that her bonnet had been taken but her gloves left i hurried down again and out of the house an impulse which i cannot understand took me to edwin urquharts house or rather to that portion of a house which he had hired for his use since he had been looking forward to his marriage with miss dudleigh why i should go there i cannot say unless jealousy whispered that only in this place could she hope for one final word with him as he and his bride stopped at the door for his portion of the baggage be this as it may i turned neither to right nor left till i came to his house and when i had reached it i found that with all my haste i was too late for not a soul was in its empty rooms while far down the street which leads to the bridge i saw a carriage disappearing which from the wagon following it so closely i knew to be the one containing urquhart and his bride she has not been here thought i or i should have met her unless and my eye stole with a certain shrinking terror toward the river which skirted along the garden at the back unless but even my thoughts stopped here i would not could not think of what if it were true would end all things for me leaving this place i wandered aimlessly through the streets studying each face that i met for intimations which should guide me in my search if not a madman i was near enough to one to make the memory of that hour hideous to me and when at last worn out as much by my emotions as by the countless steps i had taken i returned to my house for a bite and sup something in the sight of its desolation overpowered me and yielding to a despair which assured me that i should never again see her in this world i sank on the floor inert and powerless and continued thus till morning without movement and almost without consciousness fatal repose and yet i do not know if i should call it so it only robbed me of a few hours less of conscious misery for when i roused when i became again myself and looked about my house there on the floor underneath a curtain window which had been left unlatched i saw a letter containing these words honored and much abused friend when you read this marah will be no more after all that has passed after our broken marriage and the departure of my cousin life has become insupportable and believing that you would rather know me dead than miserable i ventured to write you these words and ask you to forgive me now that i am gone i loved him let that explain everything despairingly yours marah leighton with shrieks i tore from the house marah dying marah dead i would see about that racing down to the gate i paused some one was leaning on it it was cжsar and at the first glimpse i had of his face i knew i was too late that all was over and that the whole town knew it oh massa i wanted to go in but i was frightened is been waiting here an hour sah when dey told me dat dey had found her bonnet floating on de ribber i knowd how youd feel sah and so i come here and i found words to ask him a question when was this found and where this morning sah at daybreak it was caught by one of the strings to that old log sah that lies out in the ribber back of he hesitated massa urquharts house sah i knew and i had glanced that way just as her bright head was perhaps sinking under the water i threw up my arms in anguish and stumbled back into the house then every one knows i managed to say on the threshold dat she cared for him yes sah i fear so how could dey help it sah morn one person saw her run down de street and go into massas old house just before de carriage stopped thar and as she didnt come out again i specs it was from dat big log at the foot of the garden she jumped into de ribber all de folks pities you very much sah i choked him off with a look who has been sent after mr and mrs urquhart to inform them of what has happened no one yet sah but massa hatton mr hatton is an old man we must have a young one for this business go saddle me the quickest horse in your stables i will ride after them and overtake them too before they can reach poughkeepsie he shall know a glance from the negros eye warned me to be careful i smothered my impatience and let only my earnestness appear mrs urquhart ought to know that her cousin is dead i declared ill tell massa hatton said the black but my caution was now too much aroused for me to make mr hatton the medium of my request he was mrs urquharts old guardian and future agent and subduing the extreme fury of my feelings i obtained his permission to act as his messenger had he known of the letter which had been thrown into my window he might not have given his consent so freely but i had told no man of that and he and others saw me ride away without a seeming suspicion of the murderous thoughts that struggled with my grief and almost overwhelmed it for to me her death if she were dead was the result of a compact entered into with the despicable urquhart who if he could not have her for himself was willing she should go where no other man could have her though the idea seemed quixotic though it be an anomaly in human experience for a woman thus to sacrifice herself i could not ascribe any other motive to her deed for the memory of that interview she had held with her cousins future husband in the garden was still fresh in my mind do you remember the words as told me by the negro who overheard them first the question from his lips will you undertake it can you go through with it without shrinking and without fear and the reply from hers i will undertake it and i can go through with it followed by that assurance which struck me as being so inexplicable at the time and which with all the light that this late horrible event has thrown upon it still preserves its mystery for me i shall give you nothing till i am dead and then i will give you everything if the conclusions i drew seemed wild were they not warranted by these words did she not speak of death and did he not encourage her if she were not dead and sometimes this thought would cross my burning brain then she was with him forced into the company of his unwilling wife in that last interview which they must have held in his cottage in either case he was a villain and a coward deserving of death and death he should have and from the hand of him whom he had doubly outraged illustration but as i rode out of town and came in sight of the river i found myself seized by terrifying thoughts should i have to ride by the place where i could see them stooping with boat hooks and bending with peering eyes over some snag they had brought up from the river bottom could i endure to face this picture then to pass it then to ride on feeling it ever at my back blackening the morning destroying the noontide making more horrible the night could i go from this place till i knew whether or not the sullen waters would yield up their beautiful prey and would my body proceed while my heart was on this river bank and my jealousy divided between the wretch who had urged her on to death and these other men who might yet touch her unconscious form and gaze upon her disfigured beauty and the answer which welled up from within me was yes i could go i could pass that picture i could feel it glooming ever and ever upon me from behind my back and never turn my head such an impetus of hate was upon me driving me forward after the wretch fleeing in selfcomplacency and triumph into a future of wealth and social consideration but when i had done all this when my too fleet horse had carried me beyond sight of the city and nature with its irresistible beauty had begun to influence my understanding other thoughts came trooping in upon me and a vision of honora dudleighs face as she took the dagger from my hands and an implied promise from my lips rose before me till i could see nothing else honora honora honora who trusted me who had suffered everything but the sight of blood who was a bride and whom it would be base ingratitude for me to plunge into the depths of dishonor and despair and the struggle was so fierce and the torture of it so keen that ere long my brain succumbed to the strain and from the height of anguished feeling i sank into apathy and from apathy into unconsciousness till i no longer knew where i was or possessed power to guide my horse in this condition i was found wandering in a field and thence carried to a farm house where i remained a prey to fever when i returned to consciousness three weeks had elapsed as soon as i could be moved i went back to albany i found the community there settled in the belief that i had joined in death the woman i so much loved and was shown a letter which had been sent me and which had been opened by the authorities after all hope had been given up of my return it was from mrs urquhart and related how they had changed their plans upon reaching new york having found a ship on the point of sailing for france they had determined to go there instead of to the bermudas and consequently requested me to inform mr hatton of the fact and also assure him that he would hear from them personally as soon as a letter could reach him from the other side as she was in haste in truth was writing this in the post office on the way to the ship she would only add that her health had been improved by her long journey down the river and that when i heard from her again she was sure she would be able to write that all her fondest hopes had been fully realized and so marah was in the river and urquhart on the seas i had been robbed of everything even vengeance and life had nothing for me and i was determined to leave it not in the vulgar way of suicide but by cloistering myself in the great forests as no one said me nay i at once carried out this scheme and to show you how dead i had become to the world i will tell you that as i turned the lock of my door and took my first step forward on the road which led to this spot a great shout broke out in the market place the farmers of lexington have fired upon the kings troops and i did not even turn my head chapter xvi a dream ended there was silence in the cave mark felts story was at an end for a moment i sat and watched him then as i realized all that i must yet gather from his lips i broke the stillness by saying in my lowest and most suggestive tone these two words and marah the name did not seem unwelcome striking his breast he cried she lies here though she despised me deceived me broke my heart in life and in death betrayed a devotion for another that was at once my dishonor and the downfall of my every hope i have never been able to cast her out of my heart i love her and shall ever love her and so i am never lonely for in my dreams i imagine that death has changed her that she can see now where truth and beauty lie that she would fain come back to them and me and that she does walking with softened steps through the forest beaming upon me in the moon rays and smiling upon me in the sunshine till great sobs broke from the mans surcharged breast he flung himself down on the floor of the cave and hid his face in his hands he had forgotten that i had come on an errand of vengeance he had forgotten the object of that vengeance he had forgotten everything but her i saw the mistake i had made and for the moment i quailed before the prospect of rectifying it he had shown me his heart i had peered into its depths and it seemed an impossible thing to tear the last hope from his broken life to show her in her true light to his horrified eyes to tell him she was not dead that it was honora urquhart who was dead and that the woman he mourned and beheld in his visions as a sanctified spirit was not only living upon the fruits of a crime but triumphing in them that in short he had thrown away communion with men to brood upon a demon my feelings were so strong my shrinking so manifest that he noticed them at last rising up he surveyed me with a growing apprehension how you look at me he cried it is not only pity for the past i see in your eyes but fear for the future what is it what can threaten me now of importance enough to call up such an expression to your face since marah is dead wait i cried first let me ask if marah is dead his face which was turned toward me grew so pale i felt my own heart contract if marah is dead he gasped growing huskier with each intonation till the last word was almost unintelligible yes i continued ignoring his glance and talking very rapidly her body was never found you have no proof that she perished the letter that she wrote you may have been a blind such things have happened try and remember that such things have happened he did not seem to hear me turning away he looked about him with wideopen and questioning eyes like a child lost in a wood i cannot follow you he murmured marah living his own words seemed to give him life he turned upon me again do you know that she is living he asked is it this you have come to tell me if so speak speak i can bear the news i have not lost all firmness i i he stopped and looked at me piteously i saw i must speak and summoned up my courage marah may not be living i said but she did not perish in the river it would have been better for you though and infinitely better for her if she had she only lived to do evil mr felt in bemoaning her you have wasted a noble manhood oh the cry came suddenly and rang through the cavern like a knell i could not bear it and hurried forward my revelation you tell me that you received a letter from mrs urquhart before she set sail for france was it the only letter which she has ever sent you have you never heard from her since never he looked at me almost in anger i did not want to i bade the postmaster to destroy any letters which came for me i had cut myself loose from the world have you that letter did you keep it no i gave it back to the men who opened it what was it to me mark felt i now asked did you know honora dudleighs writing of course why should you question it why and was this letter in her writing written by her hand of course of course wasnt it signed with her name but the handwriting couldnt it have been an imitation wasnt it one was it not written by marah and not honora she was a clever woman and written by marah by marah great heavens did she go with them then were my secret doubts right is she lost to me in eternity as well as here is she living with him she was living with him and there is good reason to believe she is doing so still there is a mr urquhart in paris and a mrs urquhart as marah is the woman he loved she must be this latter must be i do not see why you should say must be is honora dead is honora is dead has been dead for sixteen years the woman who sailed with mr urquhart called herself honora but she was not honora she who rightfully bore this name was dead and hidden away it is of crime that i am speaking edwin urquhart is a murderer and his victim was it was not necessary to say more in the suddenly outstretched hand with its open palm in the white face so drawn that his mother would not have known it in the gradual sinking and collapsing of the whole body i saw that i had driven the truth home at last and that silence now was the only mercy left to show him i was silent therefore and waited as we wait beside a death bed for the final sigh of a departing spirit but life and not death was in the soul of this man before me ere long he faintly stirred then a smothered moan left his lips followed by one word and that word was the echo of my own murder the sound it made seemed to awake whatever energy of horror lay dormant within him bestirring himself he lifted his head and repeated again that fearsome word murder then he leaped to his feet and his aspect grew terrible as he looked up and shouted as it were into the heavens that same dread word murder filled with horror i endeavored to take him by the arm but he shook me off and cried in a terrible voice a fiend a demon a creature of the darkest hell i have worshiped her pardoned her dreamed of her for fifteen years in solitudes dedicated to god o creator of all good what sacrilege i have committed how shall i ever atone for a manhood wasted on a dream and for thoughts that must have made the angels of heaven veil their faces in wonder and pity you must have a story to tell he now said turning toward me with the first look of natural human curiosity which i had seen in his face since i came yes said i i have but it will not serve to lessen your horror it will only add to it nothing can add to it was his low reply and yet i thank you for the warning encouraged by his manner which had become strangely selfpossessed i immediately began and told him of the visit of this bridal party at your inn then as i saw that he had judged himself correctly and that he was duly prepared for all i could reveal i added first your suspicions and then a full account of our fatal discovery in the secret chamber he bore it like a man upon whom emotion has spent all its force only when i had finished he gave one groan and then as if he feared i would mistake the meaning of this evidence of suffering he made haste to exclaim poor honora my heart owes her one cry of pity one tear of grief i shall never weep for any one else though if i could it would be for myself and the wasted years with which i have mocked gods providence relieved to find him in this mood i rose and shook his hand cordially you will come back to albany with me i entreated we have need of you and this spot will never be a home to you again never the echo was unexpected but welcome i led the way out of the cave see it is late i urged he shook his head and cast one prolonged look around him what do i not leave behind me here love grief dreams and to what do i go forward can you tell me has the future in it anything for a man like me it has vengeance he gave a short cry in which she is involved talk to me not of that and yet he presently added what it is my duty to do i shall do it is all that is left to me now but i will do nothing for vengeance that would be to make a slave of myself again i had no answer for this and therefore gave none instead i shouted to my guide and after receiving from him such refreshments as my weary condition demanded i gave notice that i was ready to descend and asked the recluse if he was ready to accompany me he signified an instant acquiescence and before the sun had quite finished its course in the west we found ourselves at the foot of the mountains as civilization broke upon us mr felt drew himself up and began to question me about the changes which the revolution had made in our noble country i will not weary you my dear mrs truax with the formalities which followed upon our return to albany i will merely add that you may expect a duly authorized person to come to you presently for such testimony in this matter as it may be in your power to give after which a suitable person will proceed to france with such papers as may lead to the delivering up of these guilty persons to the united states authorities in which case justice must follow and your inn will be avenged for the most hideous crime which has ever been perpetrated within our borders most respectfully anthony tamworth part iii retribution chapter xvii strange guests september two excitements today first the appearance at my doors of the person of whose coming i was advised by mr tamworth he came in his own carriage and is a meager hatchetfaced man whose eye makes me restless but has not succeeded in making me lose my selfpossession he stayed three hours all of which he made me spend with him in the oak parlor and when he had finished with me and got my signature to a long and complicated affidavit i felt that i would rather sell my house and flee the place than go through such another experience happily it is likely to be a long time before i shall be called upon to do so a voyage to france and back is no light matter and what with complications and delays a year or more is likely to elapse before the subject need be opened again in my hearing i thank god for this for not only shall i thus have the opportunity of regaining my equanimity which has been sorely shaken by these late events but i shall have the chance of adding a few more dollars to my store against the time when scandal will be busy with this spot and public reprobation ruin its excellent character and custom the oak parlor i have shut and locked it will not be soon entered again by me the other excitement to which i referred was the coming of two new guests from new york elegant ladies whose appearance and manners quite overpowered me in the few minutes of conversation i held with them when they first entered my house good god what is that i thought i felt something brush my sleeve yet there is no one near me and nothing astir in the room and why should such a sudden vision of the old oak parlor rise before my eyes and why if i must see it should it be the room as it looked to me on that night when the two urquharts sat within it and not the room as i saw it today positively i must throw away the key of that room its very presence in my desk makes me the victim of visions october why is it that we promise ourselves certain things even swear that we will perform such and such acts and yet never keep our promises or hold to our oaths sixteen years ago i expressed a determination to refit the oak parlor and make it look more attractive to the eye i never did it a year since i declared in language as strong as i knew how to employ not that i would refit the oak parlor but that i would tear it from the house even at the cost of demolishing the whole structure and now only a week since i promised myself as my diary will testify that i would throw away the key of this place if only to rid myself of unpleasant reminders but the key is still with me and the room intact i have neither the power nor the inclination to touch it the ghost of the woman who perished there restrains me why because we are not done with that room the end of its story is not yet this i feel and i feel something further i feel that it will be entered soon and that the person who is to enter it is already in my house i have spoken of two ladies god knows with but little realization of the fatal interest they would soon possess for me they came without servants some four days ago and saying they wished to remain for a short time in this beautiful spot at once accepted the cheerful south room which i reserve for such guests as these as they are very handsome and distinguishedlooking i felt highly gratified at their patronage and was settling down to a state of complacency over the prospects of a profitable week when something i cannot tell what roused in me a spirit of suspicion and i began to notice that the elder lady was of a very uneasy disposition exhibiting a proneness to wander about the house and glide through its passages especially those on the ground floor which at first made me question her sanity and then led me to wonder if through some means unknown to me she had not received a hint as to our secret chamber i watch but cannot yet make out meanwhile a description of these women may not come amiss they are both beautiful the younger especially when i first saw them seated in my humble parlor i thought them the wife and daughter of one of our great generals they looked so handsome and carried themselves so proudly but i was presently undeceived for the name they gave was a foreign one which my english tongue finds it very hard even yet to pronounce it is written letellier with a simple madame before it for the mother and mademoiselle for the daughter but how to speak it well that is a small matter i do speak it and they never smile though the daughters eye lights up at times with a spark of what i should call mirth if her lips were not so grave and her brow so troubled yes troubled is the word though she is so young i find it difficult to regard her in any other light than that of a child though she endeavors to appear indifferent and has a way of carrying herself that is almost noble there is certainly grief in her eye and care on her brow i see it when she is alone or rather before she becomes aware of anothers presence i see it when she is with her mother but when strangers come in or she assembles with the rest of the household in the parlor or at the table then it vanishes and a sweet charm comes that reminds me but this is folly sheer folly how could she look like mrs urquhart imagination carries me too far equal innocence and a like gentle temper have produced a like result in sweetening the expression that is all and yet i remember the one woman when i look at the other and shudder for the woman who calls this child daughter has her eye on the oak parlor and may meditate evil must if she knows its secret and yet wishes to enter it but my imagination is carrying me too far again this woman whatever her faults loves her daughter and where love is there cannot be danger yet i shudder madame letellier merits the description of an abler pen than mine i like her and i hate her i admire her and i fear her i obey her and yet hold myself in readiness for rebellion if only to prove to myself that i will be strong when the time comes that no influence however exerted or however hidden under winning smiles or quietly controlling glances shall have power to move me from what i may consider my duty or from the exercise of such vigilance as my secret fears seem to demand i hate her let me remember that and i distrust her she is here for evil and her eye is on the oak parlor though it is locked and the key hidden on my person she will find means to possess herself of that key and open that door how we will see meantime all this is not a description of madame letellier she is finely formed she is graceful she is youthful she dresses with a taste that must always make her conspicuous wherever she may be you could not enter a room in which she was without seeing her for her glance has a strange power that irresistibly draws your glance to it though her eyes are lambent rather than brilliant and if large rarely opened to their full extent her complexion is dark that is in comparison with her daughters which is of a marblelike purity but it has strange flushes in it and at times seems almost to sparkle her hair is brown and worn high with a great comb in it setting off the contour of her face which is almost perfect but it is in the expression of her mouth that her fascination lies without sweetness except when it smiles upon her daughter without mirth without any expression speaking of goodwill or tenderness there is yet a turn to the lips that moves the gazer peculiarly making it dangerous to watch her long unless you are hardened by doubts as i am her hands are exquisite and her form beauty itself the daughter is statuesque not in the sense of coldness or immobility but in the regularity of her features and the absence of any coloring in her cheeks she is lovely and there breathes through every trait a gentle soul that robs my admiration of all awe and makes my old and empty heart long to serve her her eyes are gray and her hair a reddish brown with kinks and curls in it like but pshaw there comes that dream again was honora urquharts hair so very unique that a head of wavy brown hair should bring her up so startlingly to my mind they are stopping here on their way to albany so the elder lady says they came from new york so they did but if my intuitions are not greatly at fault the place they started from was france the fact that the marks and labels have all been effaced from their baggage is suspicious in itself can they be friends of the two miserable wretches who dishonored my house with a ghastly crime is it from them that madames knowledge comes if she has any knowledge the thought awakens my profoundest distrust would that mr tamworth were within reach i think i will write him but what could i write that would not look foolish on paper i had better wait a while till i see something or hear something more definite chapter xviii mrs truax talks october this morning i was exceedingly startled by one of my guests suddenly asking me before several of the others if my inn had a ghost a ghost i cried for the moment quite aghast yes was the reply it has the look of a house which could boast of such a luxury dont you think so mr westgate this is a newcomer who had just been introduced well observed the latter as i have seen only this room and as this room is anything but ghostlike at the present moment i hardly consider myself competent to judge but the exterior surely you noticed the exterior such a rambling old structure such a beetling top to it as if it had settled down here to brood over a mysterious past i never see it especially at twilight that i dont wonder what lies so heavily upon its conscience is it a crime there would be nothing strange about it if it was such old houses rarely have a clean past it was nonchalantly said but it sank deep into my heart not that i felt that he had any motive in saying it i knew the young scapegrace too well but that i was conscious from his first word of two eyes burning on my face which robbed me of all selfpossession though i think i sat without movement and only paled the slightest in the world a house that dates back to a time when the white men and the red fought every inch of the territory on which it stands would be an anomaly if it did not have some drops of blood upon it i ventured to say as soon as i could command my emotions true broke in a low slow voice that of madame letellier do you know of any especial tragedy that makes the house memorable i turned and gave her a look before replying she was seated in the shadows of a remote corner and had so withdrawn herself behind her daughter that i could see nothing of her face but her hands were visible and from the force with which she held them clasped in her lap i perceived that the subject we were discussing possessed a greater interest for her than for any one else in the room she has heard something of the tragedy connected with this house was my inward comment as i prepared to answer her there is one i began and paused something of the instinct of the cat with the mouse had entered into me i felt like playing with her suspense cruel as it may seem oh tell us broke in the daughter a sudden flush of interest suffusing for a moment her white cheek that is if it is not too horrible i never like horrible stories they frighten me and as for a ghost if i thought you kept such a creature about your house i should leave it at once we have no ghosts i answered with a gravity that struck even myself unpleasantly it was in such contrast to her mellow and playful tones ghosts are commonplace we countenance nothing commonplace here good broke in a voice from the crowd of young men the house is above such follies it must have some wonderful secret then what is it mrs truax do you own a banshee have you a mamma you hurt me the cry was involuntary madame had caught her daughter by the hand and was probably unaware what passion she had put into her clasp mademoiselle letellier blushed again at the sound of her own voice and prayed her mothers pardon with the most engaging of smiles as she did so i caught a glimpse of that mothers face it was white as death decidedly she knows more than she ought to thought i and yet she wants to know more why the happygolucky inn i observed as soon as the flutter caused by this incident had subsided is no more haunted by a banshee than by a ghost but that is not saying it should not be it is old enough it is respectable enough it has traditions enough i could tell you tales of its owners and incidents connected with the coming and going of the innumerable guests who have frequented it both before and during the revolution that would keep you here till morning but the one story i will tell must suffice we should lose our character of mystery if i told you all besides how could i tell all who could ever tell the complete story of such a house as this hear hear cried another young man years ago i stopped again wickedly stopped madame will you not come forward where it is lighter i thank you madame letellier responded she rose deliberately and came forward tall mute and commanding she sat down in the light she looked me in the face she robbed me even of my doubts i felt my heart turn over in my breast and wondered you do not proceed she murmured pardon me said i and assuming a nonchalance i was far from feeling i commenced again i had played with her fears i would play with them further i would see how much she could bear i resumed years ago when i was younger and had been mistress of this place but a short time there entered this place one evening at nightfall a young couple did you speak madame excuse me it was your daughter then yes chimed in the latter coming forward and taking her stand by the mother greatly to the delight of the young gentlemen present who asked for nothing better than an opportunity to gaze upon her modest but exquisite face yes it was i i am interested that is all i began to hate my role but went on stolidly they were a handsome pair and i felt an interest in them at once but this interest immeasurably heightened when the young man almost before the door had closed upon them drew me apart and said madame we are an unhappy couple we have been married just four hours here i paused for breath and to take a good look at madame she was fixed as a stone but her eyes were burning evidently she expected the relation of a story which she knew i would disappoint her i would cause in her first a shock of relief and then i would reawaken her fears and probe her very soul slowly and as if it were a matter of course i proceeded to say it was a runaway match and as the young husband remarked a great disappointment to my wifes father who is an english general and a great man my wife loves me and will never allow herself to be torn from me but she is not of age and her father is but a few minutes ride behind us will you let us come in we dare not risk the encounter on the road he would shoot me down like a dog and that would kill my young wife if we see him here he may take pity on our love and he needed to say no more my own compassion had been excited as much by her countenance as by his words and i threw open the doors of this very room go in said i i have a womans heart and cannot bear to see young people in distress when the general comes we shall hear him cried the girl he has half a dozen horsemen with him we saw them when we were on the brow of the hill take comfort then i cried as i closed the door and went to see after the solitary horse which had brought them to this place but before i could provide the meal with which i meant to strengthen them for the scene that must presently ensue i heard the anticipated clattering of hoofs and simultaneously with it the unclosing of this door and the cry of the young wife to her husband i cannot bear it at his first words i should fall in a faint and how could i resist him then no let me fly let me hide myself and when he comes in swear that you are here alone that you brought no bride that she left you at the altar anything to baffle his rage and give us time and the young thing sprang out before me and lifting her hands prayed with great wideopen eyes that i would assist the lie and swear to her father when he came in that her husband had ridden up alone i was not as old then as i am now i say and i was very tender toward youthful lovers though i thought the scheme a wild one and totally impracticable she so governed me by her looks and tones that i promised to do what she asked saying however that if she hid herself she must do it well for if she were found my reputation for reliability would be ruined and standing there where you see that jog in the wall she promised and giving just one look of love to her companion who stood white but firm on the threshold she sped from our sight down the hall a moment later the generals foot was where hers had been and the generals voice was filling the house asking for his daughter she is not here came from the young man in firm and stern accents you have been pleased to think she was with me all these miles but you will not find her you can search if you please i have nothing to say against that but it will be time wasted we will see about that the girl is here is she not the father asked turning to me no was my firm reply she is not i do not know how i managed the lie but i did something in the young mans aspect had nerved me i began to think she would not be found though i could see no good reason for this conclusion scatter he now shouted to his followers search the house well do not leave a nook or cranny unpenetrated i am not general b for nothing and turning to me he added you have brought this on yourself by a lie i saw my daughter in this fellows arms as they passed over the ridge of the hill she is here and in half an hour will be in my hands but the clock on the staircase struck not only the half hour but the hour and yet though every room and corridor the cellar and the garret were searched no token was found of the young wifes presence meanwhile the husband stood like a statue on the threshold waiting with what seemed to me a strange certitude for the return of the father from his fruitless search has she escaped from one of the windows i asked moved myself to a strange curiosity he looked at me but made no reply it is dark it is late if the general chooses to remain here tonight he will not find her was the reply i was frightened i know not why but i was frightened the young man had a supernatural air i began to think of demon lovers and was glad when the general finally appeared storming and raving it is a conspiracy was his cry you are all in league to deceive me where is my daughter mrs truax i ask you because you have a character to lose it is impossible for me to tell you was my reply if she was to be found in my house you must have found her as you have not there is but one conclusion to draw she is not within these walls she is not outside of them i set a watch in the beginning at the four corners of the house none of my men have seen so much as a flutter of her dress she is here i say and i ask you to give her up this i am perfectly willing to do i rejoined but i do not know where to find her let that but once be done and i shall not stand in the way of your rights very well he cried i will not search further tonight but tomorrow a meaning gesture finished his sentence he turned to the young man as for you he cried you will remain here unpleasant as it may be for us both we will keep each others company till morning i do not insist upon conversation and without waiting for a reply the sturdy old soldier took up his station in the doorway by which action he not only shut the young man in but gave himself a position of vantage from which he could survey the main hall and the most prominent passages the rest were under charge of his followers whom he had stationed all through the house just as if it were in a state of siege one guarded the east door and another the west and on each landing of the staircase a sentinel stood silent but alert like a pair of living statues i did not sleep that night the mystery of the whole affair would have kept me awake even if my indignation had let me rest i sat in the kitchen with my girls and when the morning came i joined the general again with offers of a breakfast but he would eat nothing till he had gone through the house again nor would he in fact eat here at all for his second search ended as vainly as his first and he was by this time so wroth not only at the failure to recover his child but at the loss which his dignity had suffered by this failure that he had no sooner reached this spot and found the young husband still standing where he had left him than with a smothered execration leveled not only at him but the whole house he strode out through the doorway and finding his horse ready saddled in front mounted and rode away followed by all his troop and now comes the strangest part of the tale he was no sooner gone and the dust from his horses hoofs lost in the distance than i turned to the young husband and cried and now where is she let us have her here at once she must be hungry and she must be cold bring her my good sir i do not know where she is we must be patient she will return herself as soon as she thinks it safe i could not believe my ears you do not know where she is i repeated how could you be so selfpossessed through all these hours and all this maddened searching if you did not know she was safe i did know she was safe she swore to me before she set foot on your doorstep that she could so hide herself in these walls that no one could ever find her till she chose to reveal herself and i believed her and felt secure i did not know what to say but she is a stranger i murmured what does she know about my house she is a stranger to you he retorted but she may not be a stranger to the house how long have you lived here i could not say long it was at the most but a year so i merely shook my head but i felt strangely nonplussed this feeling however soon gave way to one much more serious as the moments fled by and presently the hours and she did not come we tried to curb our impatience tried to believe that her delay was only owing to extra caution but as morning waxed to noon alarm took the place of satisfaction in our breasts and we began to search the house ourselves calling her name up and down the halls and through the empty rooms till it seemed as if the very walls must open and reveal us the being so frantically desired she is not in the house i now asserted to the almost frenzied bridegroom our lies have come back upon our heads and it is in the river we must look for her but he would not agree with me in this and repeated again and again she said she would hide here she would not deceive me nor would she have sought death alone leave me to look for her another hour i must i can i will find her yet but he never did after that last fond look with which she turned down that very hall you see before you we saw her no more and if my house owns no ghost and never echoes to the sound of a banshees warning it is not because it does not own a mystery which is certainly thrilling enough to give us either oh cried out several voices as i ceased is that all and what became of the poor bridegroom and did the father ever come back and havent you ever really found out where the poor thing went to and do you think she died for reply i rose i had never taken my eye off madame and the strain upon us both had been terrible but i let my glance wander now and smiling genially into the eager faces which had crowded around me i remarked i never spoil a good story by too many explanations you have heard all you will from me tonight so do not question me further am i not right madame perfectly came in her even tones and i am sure we are all very much obliged to you i bowed and slipped away into the background i was worn out an hour later i was passing through the hall above on my way to my own room as i passed madames door i saw it open and before i had taken three steps away i felt her soft hand on my arm your pardon mrs truax were her words but my daughter has been peculiarly affected by the story you related to us below she says it is worse than any ghost story and that she cannot rid herself of the picture of the young wife flitting out of sight down the hall i am really afraid it has produced a very bad effect upon her and that she will not sleep is it was it a true story mrs truax or were you merely weaving fancies out of a too fertile brain i smiled for she was smiling and shook my head looking directly into her eyes your daughter need not lose her sleep i said on account of any story of mine i saw they wanted something bloodcurdling so i made up a tale to please them it was all imagination madame all imagination i should not have told it if it had been otherwise i think too much of my house and you had nothing to found it upon just drew upon your fancy i smiled her light tone did not deceive me as to the anxiety underlying all this but it was not in my plan to betray my powers of penetration i preferred that she should think me her dupe oh i returned as ingenuously as if i had never had a suspicious thought i do not find it difficult to weave a tale of course such a story could not be true why i should be afraid to stay in the inn myself if it were i could never abide anything mysterious everything with me must be as open as the day and with me she laughed but there was a false note in her mirth though i did not appear to notice it i did not suppose the story was real but i thought you must have some old tradition to found it upon some old wifes tale or some secret history which is a part and parcel of the house and came to you with it but i shook my head still smiling and answered quite at my ease no old wifes tale that i have ever heard amounts to much i can make up a better story any day than those which come down with a house like this it was all the work of my imagination i assure you i tried to please them and i hope i did it her face changed at once it was as if a black veil had been drawn away from it my daughter will be so relieved she affirmed i dont mind such lugubrious tales myself but she is young and sensitive and so tenderhearted i am sure i thank you mrs truax for your consideration and beg leave to wish you a goodnight i returned her civility and we passed into our several rooms would i could know with what thoughts for my own were as much a mystery to me as were hers october madame never addresses her daughter by her first name consequently we do not know it this is a matter of surprise to the whole house and many are the conjectures uttered by the young men as to what it can be i have no especial curiosity about it i would much rather know the mothers and yet i frequently wonder for it seems unnatural for a mother always to address her child as mademoiselle is she her mother i sometimes think she is not if the interest in the oak parlor is what i think it is then she cannot be for what mother would wish to bring peril to her child and peril lies at the bottom of all interest there peril to the helpless the trusting and the ignorant but is she as interested there as i thought her i have observed nothing lately to assure me of it perhaps after all i have been mistaken chapter xix in the halls at midnight october i was not mistaken madame is not only interested in but has serious designs upon the oak parlor not content with roaming up and down the hallway leading to it she was detected yesterday morning trying to open its door and when politely questioned as to whom she was seeking answered that she was looking for the sitting room which by the way is on the other side of the house and this is not all as i lay in my bed last night resting as only a weary woman can rest i heard a light tap at my door rising i opened it and was astonished to see standing before me the light figure of mademoiselle excuse me for troubling you said she in her pure english they both speak good english though with a foreign accent i am sorry to wake you but i am so anxious about my mother she went to bed with me and we fell asleep but when i woke a little while ago she was missing and though i have waited for her a long time she does not return i am not well and easily frightened oh how cold it is i drew her in wrapped a shawl about her and led her back to her room your mother will return speedily i promised doubtless she felt restless and is taking a turn or two up and down the hall perhaps for her dressing gown and slippers are gone but she never did anything like this before and in a strange house a slight trembling stopped the young lady from continuing urging her to get into bed i spoke one or two further words of a comforting nature at which the lovely girl seemed to forget her pride for she threw her arms about my neck with a low sigh and then pushing me softly from her observed you are a kind woman you make me feel happier whenever you speak to me touched i made some loving reply and withdrew i longed to linger longed to tell her how truly i was her friend but i feared the mothers return feared to miss the knowledge of madames whereabouts which my secret suspicion made important so i subdued my feelings and hastened quickly to my room where i wrapped myself in a long dark cloak thus equipped i stole back again to the hall and gliding with as noiseless a step as possible found my way to the back stairs down which i crept holding my breath and listening intently to many who read these words the situation of those back stairs is well known but there may be others who will not understand that they lead directly after a couple of turns to that hall upon which opens the oak parlor five steps from the lower floor there is a landing and upon this landing there is a tall dutch clock so placed as to offer a very good hiding place behind it to any one anxious to gaze unobserved down the hall but to reach the clock one has to pass a window and as this looks south and was upon this night open to the moonlight i felt that the situation demanded circumspection i therefore paused when i reached the last step above the platform and listened intently before proceeding further there was no noise all was quiet as a respectable house should be at two oclock in the morning yet from the hall below came an undefinable something which made me feel that she was there a breathing influence that woke every nervous sensibility within me and made my heartbeats so irregular that i tried to stop them lest my own presence should be betrayed she was there a creeping baleful figure blotting the moonshine with her tall shadow as she passed pantherlike to and fro before that closed door or crouched against the wall in the same attitude of listening which i myself assumed or so i pictured her as i clung to the balustrade above asking myself how i could cross that strip of moonlight separating me from that vantagepoint i longed to gain for that i knew her to be there was not enough i must see her and learn if possible what the attraction was which drew her to this fatal door but how how how if she were watching as secrecy ever watches i could not take a step upon that platform without being discerned not even if a friendly cloud came to obscure the brightness of the moon could i hope to project my dark figure into that belt of light without discovery i must see what was to be seen from the step where i stood and to do this i knew but one way taking up the end of my long cloak i advanced it the merest trifle beyond the edge of the partition that separated me from the hall below then i listened again no sound no stir i breathed deeply and thrust my arm still further the long cloak hanging from it dark and impenetrable to the floor below then i waited the moonlight was not quite as bright as it had been surely that was a cloud i saw careering over the face of the sky above me and in another moment if i could wait for it the hall would be almost dark i let my arm advance an inch or so further and satisfied now that i had got the slit which answers for an armhole into a position that would afford me full opportunity of looking through the black wall i had thus improvised i watched the cloud for the moment of comparative darkness which i so confidently expected it came and with it a sound the first i had heard it was from far down the hall and was as near as i could judge of a jingling nature which for an instant i found it hard to understand then the quick suspicion came as to what it was and unable to restrain myself longer i separated the slit i have spoken of with the fingers of my right hand and looked through there she was standing before the door of the oak parlor fitting keys i knew it at my first glimpse both from her attitude and the slight noise which the keys made taken aback for i had not expected this i sank out of sight cloak and all asking myself what i should do i finally decided to do nothing i would listen and if the least intimation came to prove that she had succeeded in her endeavor i would then spring down the steps that separated us and hold her back by the hair of her head meanwhile i congratulated myself that the lock of that room was a peculiar one and that the only key i knew of that would unlock it was under the pillow of the bed i had just left she worked several minutes then the moon came out instantly all was still i knew whither she had gone near the door she was tampering with is a short passageway leading to another window into this she had slipped and i could look out now with impunity sure that she would not see me but i remained immovable there was another cloud rushing up from the south and in another moment i was confident that i should hear again the slight clatter of the key against the lock and i did and not only once but several times which fact assured me that she had not only brought a handful of keys with her but that these keys must have come from some more distant quarter than the town that indeed she had come provided to the happygolucky for this nocturnal visit and that any doubts i might cherish were likely to have a better foundation in fact than is usual with women circumstanced like myself she did not succeed in her efforts had she brought burglars tools i hardly think she would have been able to open that lock as it was there was no hope for her and presently she seemed to comprehend this for the slight sounds ceased and presently i heard a step and peering recklessly from my corner i perceived her gliding away toward the front stairs i smiled but it could not have been in a way she would have enjoyed seeing and crept noiselessly to my own room and our doors closed simultaneously this morning i watched with some anxiety for her first look it was slightly inquiring summoning up my best smile i gave her a cheerful goodmorning and then observed i am glad to see you look so well this morning your daughter seemed to be concerned about you in the night because you had left your bed but i told her i was sure all was right that you were feeling nervous and only wanted a breath of the fresh air you would find in the halls and my glance did not flinch nor my mouth lose its smile though she surveyed me keenly with eyes whose look might penetrate a stone you understand your own sex was her light reply after this short study of my face yes i was very nervous i have cares on my mind and though my daughter does not realize it i often lie awake at her side longing for space to breathe in and freedom to move as freely as my uneasiness demands last night my feelings were too much for my selfcontrol and i arose i hope i did not seriously disturb you or awaken anybody with my restless pacing up and down the hall i assured her that it took more than this to disturb me and that after quieting her daughter i had immediately fallen asleep all of which she may have believed or may not i had no means of reading her mind as she had no means of reading mine but whether she was deceived or whether she was not she certainly looked relieved and after some short remarks about the weather turned from me with the most cheerful air in the world to greet her daughter as for me i have made up my mind to change my room i shall not say anything about it or make any fuss on the subject but tonight and for some nights to come i intend to take up my abode in a certain small room in the west wing not very far removed from the dreadful oak parlor chapter xx the stone in the garden october this morning the post brought two letters for my strange guests being anxious to see how they would be received i carried them up to madame letelliers room myself the ladies were sitting together the daughter embroidering at the sight of the letters in my hand they both rose the daughter reaching me first let me have them she cried a glad bright color showing for a moment on her cheek from your father asked the mother in a tone of nonchalance that did not deceive me the girl shook her head a smile as exquisite as it was sad made her mouth beautiful from she began but stopped whether from an instinct of maidenly shame or some secret signal from her mother i cannot say well never mind the mother exclaimed and turned away toward the window in a manner that gave me my dismissal so i went out having learned nothing save the fact that mademoiselle had a lover and that her lips could smile they did not smile again however next day she looked whiter than ever and languid as a broken blossom she is ill declared madame the stairs she has to climb are too much for her ah ha thought i to myself that is the first move and waited for the next development it has not come as soon as i expected two days have passed and though mademoiselle letellier grows paler and thinner nothing more has been said about the stairs but the time has not passed without its incident and a serious enough one too if these women are as i fear in the secret of the hidden chamber it is this in the garden is a white stone it is plainfinished but unlettered it marks the restingplace of honora urquhart for reasons which we all thought good we have taken no uninterested person into the secret of this grave any more than we have into that of the hidden chamber consequently no one in the house but myself could answer madame letellier when stopping in her short walk up and down the garden path she asked what the white stone meant and what it marked i would not answer her i had seen from the window where i stood the quick surprise with which she had come to a standstill at the sight of this stone and i had caught the tremble in her usually steady voice as she made the inquiry i have mentioned above i therefore hastened down and joined her before she had left the spot you are wondering what this stone means i observed with an indifferent tone calculated to set her at her ease then suddenly and with a changed voice and a secret look into her face i added it is a headstone a dead body lies here she quivered and her lids fell for all her selfpossession and she is the most selfpossessed person i ever saw in my life she showed a change that gave me new thoughts and made me summon up all the strength i am mistress of in order to preserve the composure which her agitation had so deeply shaken illustration you shock me were her first words uttered very slowly and with a transparent show of indifference it is not usual to find a garden used for a burial place may i ask whose body lies here that of some faithful black or of a favorite horse it is not that of a horse i returned calmly and greatly pleased to find that i had placed her in a position where she would be obliged to press the question if she would learn anything more i walked slowly on convinced that she would follow me she did giving me short side glances which i bore with an equanimity that much belied the tempest of doubt repugnance and horror that were struggling blindly in my breast but she did not renew the subject of the grave instead of that she opened one of her most fascinating conversations endeavoring by her wiles and graces to get at my confidence and insure my good will and i was hypocrite enough to deceive her into thinking she had done so though i showed her no great warmth i carefully restrained myself from betraying my real feelings allowing her to talk on and giving her now and then an encouraging word or an inviting smile for i felt that she was a serpent and must be met as such if she were the woman i thought her i should gain nothing and lose all by betraying my distrust while if she felt me to be her dupe i might yet light upon the secret of her interest in the oak parlor her daughter was waiting for us in the doorway when we reached the house at the sight of her pure face with its tender gray eyes and faultless features a strong revulsion seized me and i found it difficult not to raise my arms in protest between her beauty and winning womanliness and the subtile and treacheroushearted being who glided so smoothly toward her but the movement had i made it would have been in vain at the sight of each others faces a lovely smile arose on the daughters lips while on the mothers flashed a look of love which would be unmistakable even on the countenance of a tiger and which was at this moment so vivid and so real that i never doubted again if i had ever doubted before that mademoiselle was her own child flesh of her flesh and bone of her bone ah mamma cried one soft voice i have been so lonesome darling returned the other in tones as true and caressing i will not leave you again even for a walk till you are quite well and taking her by the waist she led her down the hall toward the stairs looking back at me as she did so and saying i cannot take her to albany until she is better you must think what we can do to make her strong again mrs truax and she sighed as she looked up the short flight of stairs her daughter had to climb october that stone in the garden seems to possess a magnetic attraction for madame she is over it or near it half the time if i go out in the early morning to gather grapes for dinner there she is before me pacing up and down the paths converging to that spot and gazing with eager eyes at that simple stone as if by the force of her will she would extract its secret and make it tell her what she evidently burns to know if i want flowers for the parlor mantel and hurry into the garden during the heat of the day there is madame with a huge hat on her head plucking asters or pulling down apples from the lowhanging branches of the trees it is the same at nightfall suspicious always suspicious now i frequently stop in passing through the upper western hall to take a peep from the one window that overlooks this part of the garden i invariably see her there and remembering that her daughter is ill remembering that in my hearing she promised that daughter that she would not leave her again i feel impelled at times to remind her of the fact and see what reply will follow but i know she will say that she is not well herself that the breeze from the river does her good that she loves nature and sleeps better after a ramble under the stars i cannot disconcert her not for long and i cannot compete with her in volubility and conversational address so i will continue to play a discreet part and wait october madame has become bolder or her curiosity more impatient hitherto she has been content with haunting the garden and walking over and about that one place in it which possesses peculiar interest for her and me but this evening when she thought no one was looking when after a hurried survey of the house and grounds she failed to detect my sharp eyes behind the curtain of the upper window she threw aside discretion knelt down on the sod of that grave and pushed aside the grass that grows about the stone doubtless to see if there was any marks or inscription upon it there are none but i determined she should not be sure of this so before she could satisfy herself i threw up the window behind which i stood making so much noise that it alarmed her and she hastily rose i met her hasty look with a smile which it was too dark for her to see and a cheerful good evening which i presume fell with anything but a cheerful sound upon her ears it is a lovely evening i cried have you been admiring the sunset ah so much was her quick reply and she began to saunter in slowly but i knew she left her thoughts out there with that mysterious grave m another midnight adventure late as it is i must put it down for i cannot sleep and tomorrow will bring its own story i had gone to bed but not to sleep the anxieties under which i now labor the sense of mystery which pervades the whole house and the secret but everpresent apprehension of some impending catastrophe which has followed me ever since these women came into the house lay heavily on my mind and prevented all rest the change of room may also have added to my disturbance i am wedded to old things old ways and habitual surroundings i was not at home in this small and stuffy apartment with its one narrow window and wretched accommodations nor could i forget near what it lay nor rid myself of the horror which its walls gave me whenever i realized as i invariably did at night that only a slight partition separated me from the secret chamber with its ghastly memories and ever to be remembered horrors i was lying then awake when some impulse was it a magnetic one caused me to rise and look out of the window i did not see anything unusual not at first and i drew back but the impulse returned and i looked again and this time perceived among the shadows of the trees something stirring in the garden though what i could not tell for the night was unusually dark and my window very poorly situated for seeing but that there was something there was enough and after another vain attempt to satisfy myself as to its character i dressed and went out into the hall determined to ascertain if any outlet to the house was open i did not take a light for i know the corridors as i do my own hand but i almost wished i had as i sped from door to door and window to window for the events which had blotted my house with mystery were beginning to work upon my mind and i felt afraid not of my shadow for i could not see it but of my step and the great gulfs of darkness that were continually opening before my eyes however i did not draw back and i did not delay i tried the front door and found it locked then the south door and finally the one in the kitchen this last was ajar i knew then what had happened madame has had more than one talk with chloe lately and the good negress has not been proof against her wiles and has taught her the secret of the kitchen lock i shall talk to chloe tomorrow but meantime i must follow madame but should i i know what she is doing in the garden she is wandering round and round that grave if i saw her i could not be any surer of the fact and i would but reveal my own suspicions to her by showing myself as a spy no i will remain here in the shadows of the kitchen and wait for her to return the watch may be weird but no weirder than that of a previous night besides it will not be a long one the air is too chilly outside for her to risk a lengthy stay in it i shall soon perceive her dark figure glide in through the doorway and i did almost before i had withdrawn into my corner i heard the faint fall of feet on the stone without then the subdued but unmistakable sound of the opening door and lastly the locking of it and the hasty tread of footsteps as she glided across the brick flagging and disappeared into the hall beyond she has laid the ghost of her unrest for tonight thought i tomorrow it will rise again and i felt my first movement of pity for her alas does that unrest spring from premeditated or already accomplished guilt whichever it may be and i am ready to believe in either or both she is a burdened creature and the weight of her fears or her intentions lies heavily upon her but she hides the fact with consummate address and when under the eyes of people smiles so brightly and conducts herself with such a charming grace that half the guests that come and go consider her as lovely and more captivating than her daughter what would they think if they could see her as i do rising in the night to roam about a grave the unmarked headstone of which baffles her scrutiny october this morning i rose at daybreak and going into the garden surveyed the spot which i had imagined traversed by madame letellier the night before i found it slightly trampled but what interested me a great deal more than this was the fact that on a certain portion of the surface of the stone i have so often mentioned there were to be seen small particles of a white substance which i soon discovered to be wax thus the mystery of her midnight visit is solved she has been taking an impression of what in her one short glimpse of yesterday evening she had thought to be an inscription what a wonderful woman she is what skill she shows what secrecy and what purpose if she cannot compass her end in one way she will in another and i begin to have notwithstanding my repugnance and fear a wholesome respect for her ability and the relentless determination which she shows in every action she performs when she finds that her wax shows her nothing but the natural excrescences and roughnesses of an unhewn stone will she persist in her visits to the garden i think not october my last surmise was a true one madame has not spent a half hour all told in the garden since that night she has turned her attention again to the oak parlor and soon we shall see her make some decided move in regard to it chapter xxi in the oak parlor october the long expected move has been made this morning madame asked me if i had not some room on the ground floor which i could give to her daughter and her in exchange for the one they now occupy her daughter had been accustomed to living on one floor and felt the stairs keenly i answered at first no then i appeared to bethink me and told her with seeming reluctance that there was one room below which i sometimes opened to guests but that just now it was in such a state of dilapidation i had shut it up till i could find the opportunity of repairing it oh she replied subduing her eagerness to the proper point you need not wait for that we are not particular persons only let me see the roses come back to my daughters cheeks and i can bear any amount of discomfort where is this room i pretended not to hear her it would take two days to get it into any sort of condition fit for sleeping in i murmured reflectively the floor is so loose in places that you cannot walk across it without danger of falling through then there is the chimney she was standing near me and i heard her draw her breath quickly but she gave no other sign of emotion not even in the sound of her voice as she interrupted me with the words oh if you have got to make the room all over we might as well not consider the subject but i am sure it is not necessary do let me see it and i can soon tell you whether we can be comfortable there or not i had sworn to myself never to enter that room again but such oaths are easily broken leaving her for a moment i procured my key and taking her with me down the west hall i unlocked the fatal door and bade her enter she hesitated for an instant but only for an instant then she walked coolly in and stood waiting while i crossed the floor to the window and threw it open her first glance flashed to the mantel and its adjacent wainscoting then finding everything satisfactory in that direction it flew over the desolate walls and stiff highbacked chairs till it rested on the bare fourposter denuded of its curtains and coverlets a gloomy place she declared but you can easily make it look inviting with fresh curtains and a cheerful fire i am sure that dismal as it is it will be more welcome to my daughter than the sunny room up stairs besides the window looks out on the river and that is always interesting you will let us come here will you not i am sure if we are willing you ought to be i gasped inwardly and agreed with her yet i made a few more objections but as i intended that she should sleep in this room i finally cleared my brow and announced that the room should be ready for her occupancy on friday and with this she had to be content october bless god that i am mistress in my own house i can order i can have performed whatever i choose without fuss without noise and without gossip this is very fortunate just now for while i am openly having the floor mended in the oak parlor i am secretly having another piece of work done which if once known would arouse suspicions and awaken conjectures that would destroy all my plans concerning the mysterious guests who insist upon inhabiting the accursed oak parlor what this work is can be best understood by a glance at the accompanying diagram which is a copy of the one drawn up by the englishman for mr tamworth illustration a oak parlor b bedroom c kitchen etc d passage i have had made secret chamber fireplace secret spring garden window door to oak parlor clock on stairs to second story entrance to room b under stairway here you see that the secret chamber lies between the rooms a and b a is the parlor and b is the small room in which i had put up my bed after the nocturnal adventure of october it has always been used as a store room until now and as no one handles the keys of this house but myself the fact of my using it for any other purpose is known only to margery and a certain quiet and reticent workman from crugers shop to whom i have intrusted the task of opening a passage at d through the wall for i must have proper means of communication with this room before i can allow madame letellier and her daughter to take up their abode in it though the formers plans are a mystery to me though i feel that she loves her daughter and therefore cannot meditate evil against her still my doubts of her are so great that i must know her intentions if possible and to do this i contemplate keeping a watch over that den of wicked memories which will be at once both unsuspected and vigilant the flooring of the parlor is nearly completed and tonight will see the door of communication between my room and the secret chamber hung and ready for use october a month ago if any one had told me that i would not only walk of my own free will into the secret chamber but take up my abode in it eat in it and sleep in it i would have said that person was mad and yet this is just what i have done the result of my first vigil was unexpected i had looked for well i hardly know what i did look for my anticipations were vague but they did not lead me in the right direction but let me tell the story after i had installed my guests in their new apartment i informed them that i would have to say goodby for a season as i had an affection of the eyes which was true enough which at times compelled me to shut myself up in a dark room and forego all company that i felt one of these spells coming on which was not true and that by a speedy resort to darkness and quiet i hoped to prevent the attack from reaching its usual point of distress mademoiselle letellier looked disappointed but madame ill disguised her relief and satisfaction convinced now beyond all doubt that she had some plan in mind which made her dread my watchfulness i made such final arrangements as were necessary and betook myself at once to my new room once there i moved immediately into the dark chamber and walking with the utmost circumspection crossed to the wall adjoining the oak parlor and laying my ear against the opening into that room i listened at first i heard nothing probably because its inmates were still then i caught an exclamation of weariness and soon some words of desultory conversation relieved beyond expression not only because i could hear but because they talked in english i withdrew again into my own room the most difficult problem in the world was solved i had found the means by which i could insinuate myself unseen and unsuspected into the secret confidences of two women at moments when they felt themselves alone and at the mercy of no judgment but that of god should i learn enough to pay me for the humiliation of my position i did not weary myself by questioning i knew my motive was pure and fixed my mind upon that several times before the day was over did i return to the secret chamber and bend my ear to the wall but in no instance did i linger long for if the two ladies spoke at all it was on trivial subjects and in such tones as indicated that neither their passions nor any particular interests were engaged for such talk i had no ear it will not be always so i thought to myself when night comes and the heart opens they will speak of what lies upon their minds and so it happened as the inn grew quiet and the lights began to disappear from the windows i crept again to my station against the partition and in a darkness and atmosphere that at any other time in my life would have completely unnerved me hearkened to the conversation within oh mamma were the first words i heard uttered in english as all their talk was when they were moved or excited if you would only explain if you would only tell me why you do not wish me to receive letters from him but this silence this love and this silence are killing me i cannot bear it i feel like a lost child who hears its mothers voice in the darkness but does not know how to follow that voice to the refuge it bespeaks time was when daughters found it sufficient to know that their parents disapproved of an act without inquiring into their reasons for it your father has told you that the marquis is not eligible as a husband for you and he expects this to content you have i the right to say more than he not the right perhaps mamma i do not appeal to your sense of right but to your love i am very unhappy my whole lifes peace is trembling in the balance you ought to see it you do see it yet you let me suffer without giving me one reason why i should do so the mothers voice was still you see the daughter went on again after what seemed like a moment of helpless waiting though my arms are about you and my cheek pressed close to yours you will not speak do you wonder that i am heartbroken that i feel like turning my face to the wall and never looking up again i wonder at nothing was that madames voice what boundless misery what unfathomable passion what hopeless despair if he were unworthy her daughter here exclaimed it you could point to anything he lacks but he has wealth a noble name a face so handsome that i have seen both you and papa look at him in admiration and as for his mind and attainments are they not superior to those of all the young men who have ever visited us mamma mamma you are so good that you require perfection in a soninlaw but is he not as near it as a man may be tell me darling for in my dreams he always seems so i heard the answer though it came slowly and with apparent effort the marquis is an admirable young man but we have another suitor in mind whose cause we more favor we wish you to marry armand thierry a shopkeeper and a revolutionist oh mamma that is why we brought you away that is why you are here that you might have opportunity to bethink yourself and learn that the parents views in these matters are the truest ones and that where we make choice there you must plight your troth i assure you that our reasons are good ones if we do not give them it is not from tyranny here the set strained voice stopped and a sudden movement in the room beyond showed that the mother had risen in fact i presently heard her steps pacing up and down the floor i know it is not tyranny the daughter finished in the soft tones that were so great a contrast to her mothers tyranny i could have understood but it is mystery and that is not so easily comprehended why should you and papa be mysterious what is there in our simple life to create secrecy between persons who love each other so dearly i see nothing know nothing and yet honora the word struck me like a blow honora great heaven was that the name of this young girl you are giving too free range to your imagination you i did not hear the rest i was thinking of the name i had just heard and wondering if my suspicions were at fault they would never have called their child honora who were these women then friends of the dudleighs avengers of the dead i glued my ear still closer to the wall we have cherished you the mother was still speaking we have given you all you craved and more than you asked from the moment you were born we have both lavished all the tenderness of our hearts upon you and all we ask in return is trust the hard voice hard because of emotion i truly believe quavered a little over that word but spoke it and went on what we do for you now as always is for your best good will you not believe it honora the last appeal was uttered in a passionate tone it seemed to move the daughter for her voice had a sob in it as she replied yes yes but why not enlighten me as to your reasons for a course so remarkable most parents desire their daughters to do well but you on the contrary not only wish but urge me to do ill a noble lover sues for my hand and his cause is slighted an ignoble one requests the same favor and you run to grant it is there love in this is there consideration perhaps but if so you should be able to show where it lies i am not a child young as i am i will understand any reasons you may advance then let me have your confidence it is all i ask and surely it is not much when you see how i suffer from my disappointment the restless steps ceased i heard a groan close to my ear the mother was evidently suffering frightfully papa is prosperous the daughter pleadingly continued i know your decision cannot be the result of financial difficulties and then if it were the marquis is rich and honora the mother had turned i heard her advance toward her daughter do you really love the marquis you have seen him but a few times have held hardly any intercourse with him and at your age fancy often takes the place of love you do not love him honora my child you cannot you will forget oh mamma oh mamma oh mamma the tone was enough silence reigned broken at last by mademoiselle letellier saying it is not necessary to see such a man as he is very many times in order to adjudge him to be the best and noblest that the world contains but mamma you are not correct in saying that i scarcely know him though you will not be frank with me i am going to be frank with you and tell you something that i have hitherto kept closely buried in my breast i did not think i should ever speak of it to any one not even to you some dreams are so sweet to brood upon alone but the shadow which your silence has caused to fall between us has taught me the value of openness and truth i shall never hide anything from you again so listen sweet mamma while i open to you my heart and learn as you can only learn from me how your honora first came to know and appreciate the marquis de la rocheguyon was it not interrupted the mother at the great ball where he was formally introduced to us no mamma madame sighed girls are all alike she cried you think you know them and lo there comes a day when you find that it is in a strangers hand you must look for a key to their natures and is not this what god wills suggested the child indeed indeed you must blame nature and not me i did not want to deceive you i only found it impossible to speak besides if you had looked at me closely enough you would have seen yourself that i had met the marquis before such blushes do not come with a first introduction i remember their burning heat yet are my cheeks warm now i feel as if they ought to be but there is nothing to grieve you in these blushes it is only the way a loving heart takes to speak there is no wicked shame in them none none oh god did the daughter hear that bitter exclamation she did not appear to for her voice was quite calm though immeasurably loving as she proceeded in these words i was always a mothergirl from the first day i can remember i have known nothing sweeter than to sit within reach of your fondling hand you were always so tender with me mamma even when i must have grieved you or disappointed your hopes or your pride if i were in the way i never saw it nor can i remember of all the looks which have sometimes puzzled me in your face one that spoke of impatience or lack of sympathy with my pleasures or my griefs with papa it was not always so no dont stop me you must let me speak of him though he has never been unkind to me he has a way of frowning at times that frightens me whether he is displeased or simply ill i cannot say but i have always felt a dread of papas presence which i never felt of yours and yet you frown too at times though never upon me mamma dear never upon me a pause that was filled in by a kiss and then the tender voice went on you can imagine then what a turmoil was aroused in my breast when one day while leaning from the window i saw a face in the street below that awakened within me such strange feelings i could not communicate them even to my mother i who had hitherto confessed to her every trivial emotion of my life shrank in a moment as it were from revealing a secret no deeper than that i had looked for one half minute upon the form of a passing stranger and in that minute learned more of my own heart and of the true meaning of life than in all the sixteen years i had hitherto lived you have seen him since and you know he possesses every grace that can render a man attractive but to me that day he did not look like a man at all or if i thought of him as such i thought of him as one who set a pattern to his fellows while retaining his own immeasurable superiority he did not see me i do not know that i wished him to i was quite content to watch him from where i stood and note his lordly walk and kindly mien and dream oh what did i dream that day the memory of your own girlhood must tell you mamma i did not know his name i did not suspect his rank but from his youth i judged him to be single from his bearing i knew him to be noble and from his look which called out a reflected brightness on every face he chanced to pass i was assured that he was happy and that he was good and what does a girls fancy need more still a glimpse so short might not have had such deep consequences if it had not been followed by an event which rendered those first impressions indelible an event honora yes mamma you remember the day you sent me with cecile to take my first lessons in tambour work of madame douay remember oh my child that awful day when you came near losing your life when the house fell with you in it and yes yes mamma and i came home looking so pale you thought i was hurt and fainted away and would have died yourself if i had not kissed you back to life well mamma dear i was hurt but not in my body it was my heart that had received a wound a wound from which i never shall recover for it was made by the greatness the goodness the noble selfsacrifice of the marquis honora and you never mentioned his name never i know i know mamma but you have already forgiven me for that you know it was from no unworthy motive think how you felt when you first saw papa think a hurried movement from the mother interrupted her do not keep me in suspense she pleaded let me hear what you have to tell but you are cold you shudder let me get a shawl no no child i am not cold only impatient go on with your story go on how came you to meet the marquis in that place ah cried the daughter it was a strange occurrence it all came about through a mistake of ceciles madame douay as we were told by the concierge lived on the fourth floor but cecile made a miscount and we went up to the fifth and as there was a madame douay there also we did not detect our error but went into her apartments and were seated in the small salon to await madames presence we had not told our errand so we could not blame the maid who admitted us nor though madame failed to appear did we ever remember to blame any one for presently through the open window near which we sat there came the sound of voices from the room above and a drama began of such startling interest that we could think of nothing else two men were talking young men they seemed and though i could not see them i could tell from the fresh fine voice of the one that he was a true man and from the sneering smothered tones of the other that he was not only a cynic but of vicious tendencies the first one was saying i never suspected this when my attention was first called to their words and the answer which came was as follows if you had i should not have had the pleasure of seeing you here men are not apt to rush voluntarily upon their deaths and that you are a dead man you already know for i have sworn to kill you as the clock strikes three and it is but ten minutes of that time and you have not a weapon with which to defend yourself mamma you can imagine my feelings at hearing these words though they were uttered by a person i could not see to another person equally unknown to me i looked at cecile and she looked at me but we could neither of us move every faculty seemed paralyzed save that of hearing we held our breaths and listened for the reply it came instantly and without a thrill in its clear accents you are a gentleman and no common assassin how can you reconcile such an act as this with your honor or with what sophistries quiet the stings of your conscience when time shall have shown you the sin of so unprovoked an onslaught it is not unprovoked was the harsh and bitter reply you promised to marry mademoiselle de fontaine and yesterday at three oclock ah i was there you formally renounced your claims this is an insult that calls for blood and blood it shall have twentyfour hours have elapsed less ten minutes since you cast this slur upon a noble ladys good name when the hour is ripe you will pay the penalty it requires with your life but urged his young companion mademoiselle de fontaine had herself requested the breaking off of this contract i am but following the ladys behests in withdrawing from a position forced upon us against our will and in direct opposition to her happiness and by what right do you presume to follow the behests of a lady still under age has she not guardians to consult should not i you pardon me i have not introduced myself it seems i am the marquis de la rocheguyon honora paused her mothers exclamation had stopped her the marquis oh honora and you have always said he was so good wait mamma remember it is the cynical voice which is speaking and the marquiss voice is not cynical the words however are what i have told you i am the marquis de la rocheguyon of course not knowing either party nor this name least of all realizing that it was the one by which the gentleman addressed was himself known i did not understand why it should create so great an impression but that it did was evident not only from the momentary hush that followed but from the violent exclamation that burst from the young mans lips you scoundrel was his cry but instantly he seemed to regret the word for he said almost with the same breath your pardon but there is but one man in the world besides myself who could under any circumstances have a right to that name and that man is my cousin the deceased marquiss son long esteemed dead also and now legally accepted as such and what assures you that i am not he your eyes well i am changed louis but not so changed that a good look should not satisfy you that i am the man i claim to be besides you should know this mark on my forehead you gave it to me isidor i could not comprehend it then but i have learned since that the marquis our marquis i mean had only just come into his title that the son of the preceding marquis de la rocheguyon had been so long missing that the courts had finally adjudged him dead and given up his inheritance to his cousin that the first act of the new marquis was to liberate the demoiselle de fontaine from an engagement that stood in the way of her marriage with one more desirable to her and that the unexpected appearance of the real heir in this sudden and mysterious manner was as great a surprise to him as any mortal circumstance could be yet to me who waited with palpitating heart and anxious ears for what should be said next there was no evidence of this in his tone with the politeness we are accustomed to in frenchmen he observed you are welcome isidor and then as if struck himself by the incongruity between this phrase and the look and manner of his companion he added in slow tones even if you do bring a sword with you the other the real marquis as i suppose seemed to hesitate at this and i began to hope he was ashamed of his dreadful threats and would speedily beg the others pardon but i did not know the man or realize the determination which lay at the bottom of his furious and uncompromising words but he soon made it evident to us louis he exclaimed you have always been my evil genius from our childhood you have stood in my way with your superior strength beauty prowess and address when i was young i simply shrank from you in shame and distaste but as i grew older i learned to detest you and now that i see you again after five years of absence handsome as ever taller than ever and radiant notwithstanding your nearness to death with memories such as i have never known nor can know and beliefs such as i have never cherished nor will cherish i hate you so that i find it difficult to wait for the five minutes yet to elapse before my word will let me lift my pistol and fire upon you then it is your hate of me and not your fondness for your sister that has led you to lay this trap for me exclaimed the other i should think your hate would be satisfied by the change which your return will make in my prospects from the marquisate of la rocheguyon to a simple captaincy in his majestys guards is quite a step isidor will it not suffice to soothe an antagonism which i never shared nothing can soothe it not even your death you have robbed me of too much first of the worlds esteem then of my mothers confidence and lastly of my fathers love yes deny it if you will my father loved you better than he did me this was the reason he sent me from home and when shipwrecked and captured by savages i found myself thrown into an eastern dungeon half my misery and all my rage were in the thought that he would not consider my loss a misfortune but die in greater peace and hope from knowing that his family honors would devolve upon one more after his own heart than myself oh i have had cause and i have had time to nourish my hate five years in a dungeon affords one leisure and on every square stone of that wall and upon every inch of its relentless pavement i have beaten out this determination with my bare hands and manacled feet that if i ever did escape and ever did return to the home of my fathers i would have full pay for the suffering you have caused me even if i had it in your blood i have returned and i find my father dead and in his place yourself happy insolent and triumphant can you blame me for remembering my vows for resenting what will ever seem an insult to my sister and for wishing to hurry the time that moves so slowly toward the fatal stroke of three i do not blame you because you are a madman i do not fear you because having no one in the world to love i do not greatly dread a sudden release from it but i pity you because you have suffered and will defend myself because your sufferings will be increased rather than diminished by the success of your crazy intentions the answer came quick and furious i do not want your pity and i scorn any defense which you can make do you think i have not made my calculations well there is nothing here which can give you hope we are alone on the sixth story beneath us are only women and if you call from the window i can shoot you dead before your voice can reach the street perhaps though you do not think of saving yourself but of ensnaring me bah as if the sight of the headsman would stop me now besides i am prepared for flight have you looked at this house it is not like other houses it is double and the room in which we stand has other foundations and walls from this one behind me which i guard with my pistol let the deed be once done and the clock as you see gives us but one minute more and i leap into this other apartment down another flight of stairs from those you came up and so to another door that opens upon another street then shout if you will i am safe as to your life it is as much at my command as if my bullet were already in your heart we will see was the thundering reply and with these words a rush was made that shook the floor above our heads and scattered bits of plaster down upon us released by the action from the fearful spell which had benumbed my limbs i felt that i could move at last and leaping to my feet i uttered scream after scream but they perished in my throat smothered by a new fear for at this moment my arm was caught by cecile and following with horrified gaze the pointing of her uplifted hand i saw the straight line of the windowledge before me dip and curve and yielding to the force of her agonized strength i let myself be dragged across the floor while before us beneath us above us all was one chaos of heaving and crashing timbers which in another instant broke into a thunder of confused sounds and we beheld beneath us a pit of darkness death and tumult where but an instant before were all the appurtenances of a comfortable and luxurious home we were safe for we had reached the flooring of the second house before that of the first had completely fallen but i could not think of myself narrow as my escape had been and marvelous as was the warning which had revealed to cecile the only path of safety for in the clouded space above me overhanging a gulf i dared not measure with my eyes or sound with my imagination i saw clinging by one arm to a beam the awful figure of a man while crouching near him on a portion of flooring that still clung intact to the wall i beheld another in whose noble traits distorted though they were by the emotions of the moment i recognized him who but a month before had changed the world for me with his look ah mamma and a thousand deaths lay between us and we could neither reach him nor give any alarm for the space in which we found ourselves was small and shut from the outer world by a door which was locked how it became locked i never knew but i have thought that the maid in flying might have turned the key behind her under some wild impression that by this means she would shut out destruction however that may be we were helpless and threatened by death but our own situation did not alarm us for theirs was so much more terrible especially that of the man whose straining arm clung so frantically to a support that threatened every moment to slip from his grasp i could not look at him and scarcely could i look at the other but i did for in his face there was such a high and noble resolve that it made me forget his danger till suddenly i heard him speak high above the sounds that arose in a tempest from the street do not despair isidor i think i can reach you and pull you up upon the beam you shall not die a dogs death if i can help it hold on and i will come and he began to move and raise himself upon the narrow platform on which he stood and i saw that he meant what he said and involuntarily and with but little reason i cried dont do it he is your enemy save yourself he is but a murderer let him go i said that i who never had a cruel thought before in my life but he without looking to see whence this voice came answered boldly it is because he is my enemy that i wish to save him i could never enjoy a safety won at the expense of his death isidor you must live so hold on my cousin illustration and without saying anything further this brave man set about a task that seemed to me at that moment not only superhuman but impossible gathering himself up he prepared to make a spring and in another instant would have launched himself toward that rocking beam if cecile driven to extremity by the slow tottering of the floor upon which we stood had not shrieked and to save him you would leave us to perish he paused and gave one look yes he cried god help you but you look like innocent women while he the leap was made he lay clinging to the beam his cousin who had not fallen cast one glance up their eyes met and isidor as he was called gave one great sob oh louis he murmured and was silent and then mamma there began a struggle for rescue such as i dare not even recall i saw it because i could not look elsewhere but i crushed its meaning from my consciousness lest i should myself perish before i saw him safe and all the while the figure hanging over us swayed with the rocking of the beam and gave no help until that last terrible moment when his cousin reaching down was able to sustain him under the arm till he could get his other hand up and clasp it around the beam then it all looked well and we began to hope when suddenly and without warning the nearly rescued man gave a great shriek and crying you have conquered unloosed his grasp and fell headlong into the abyss mamma i did not faint an unnatural strength seemed given to me but i looked at the marquis and for the first time he looked at me and i saw the expression of horrified amaze with which he had beheld his cousin disappear gradually change to one of the softest and divinest looks that ever visited a noble visage and knew that even out of that pit of death love had arisen for us two and that henceforth we belonged to each other whether our span of life should be cut short in a moment or extended into an eternity of years his own heart seemed to assure him of the same sweet fact for the next moment he was renewing his superhuman efforts but this time for our rescue and his own he worked himself along that beam he gave another leap he landed at our side and tore a way for us through that closed door in another five minutes we were in the street with half paris surging about us but before the crowd had quite seized upon me he had found time to whisper in my ear i am the marquis de la rocheguyon it will always be a matter of thankfulness to me that i was not left to sacrifice the fairest woman in the world to the rescue of a thankless coward mamma do you blame me for giving such a man my heart and do you wonder that what i have dedicated to this hero i can never yield to any other man the mother was silent for a long time silent was she horrorstricken at the story of a danger she had never fully comprehended till now or were her thoughts busy with her own past and its possible incommunicable secrets of blood and horror the cry she gave at last betrayed anguish but did not answer this question my child my child my child that was all but it seemed torn from her heart that bled after it he was not long in seeking me out mamma dear with grace and consideration he paid me his court and i was happy till i saw that you and papa frowned upon an alliance that to me seemed laden with promise i could not understand it nor could i understand our hurried departure from france nor our secret journey here all has been a mystery to me but your will is my will and i dare not complain pure heart broke from the mothers lips would to god what dear mamma that you had been moved by a lesser man than the marquis de la rocheguyon a lesser man with armand thierry since he is the one you will have to marry i shall not marry him shall not if i cannot give my hand where my heart is i remain unmarried i dishonor no man with unmeaning marriage vows honora i may never be happy but i will never be base you yourself cannot wish me to be that you who married for love must understand that a woman loses her title to respect when she utters vows to one man while her heart is with another but you did marry for love didnt you sweet mamma i like to think so i like to think that papa never cared for any other woman in all the world but you and that from the moment you first saw him you knew him to be the one man capable of rousing every noble instinct within you it is so sweet to enshrine you in such a pure romance mamma though you have been married sixteen years ah how old i am i see you sit and look at papa sometimes for a long long time without speaking and though you do not smile i think she is dreaming of the days when life was pure joy because it was pure love and i long to ask you to tell me about those days because i am sure if you did you would tell me the sweetest story of mutual love and devotion isnt it so mamma mine would that mother answer could she i seemed to behold her figure pausing petrified in the darkness drawing deep breaths and scarcely knowing whether to curse or pray i listened and listened but it was long before the answer came then it was short and hurried like the pants of one dying honora you hurt me another silence you make my task too hard if i know what love is she found it hard to go on but she did all the more anguish it must cost me to deny you what is so deeply desired i i would make you happy if i could i will make you happy if it is in my power to do so but i can hold out no hope none none nor tell me why nor tell you why mamma you suffer i see it now and somehow it makes it easier for me to bear my own suffering you do not willfully deny me what is as much as my life to me willfully honora listen the mother had stopped in her walk for i heard her restless tread no more you say that i suffer child i have never had one happy day whatever romance you have woven about me i have never known from the hour of my birth till now one moment of such delight as you experienced when you saw the character of the marquis unfold before you so grandly the nearest i have ever come to bliss was when you were first placed in my arms then indeed for one wild moment i felt the baptism of true love i looked at you and my heart opened alas it was to take in pain as well as joy you had the face oh heaven what am i saying this darkness unnerves me honora let us have light light anything to keep my reason from faltering mother mother you are ill no i am simply weak i always am when i recall your birth and the first few days that followed it i was so glad to have something i could really love so glad to feel that my heart beat and to know that it beat for one so innocent so sweet so helpless as yourself what if i had pains and hours of darkness did i not have your smile also and later on your love child if there has been any good in my life and sometimes i have thought there was a little it came from you so never even question again if i could hurt you willfully i not only could not do this and live but to save you from pain i would dare what would i not dare let man or angels say before such passion as this young honora sank helpless oh mamma mamma she moaned forgive me i did not know how could i know dont sob mamma dear let me hold you so now lay your cheek against mine and simply love me i will lie quite still and ask no questions and you will rest too and god will bless us as he always blesses the loving and the true but madame did not comply with this endearing request satisfying her daughter with a few kisses and some words that the paroxysm of her grief was past she resumed her walk up and down the room pausing every now and then as if to listen and hastily resuming her walk as some slight exclamation from the bed assured her that mademoiselle was not yet asleep as these pauses always took place when she was near the wall behind which i crouched i frequently heard her breath which came heavily and once the rustle of her gown but i did not stir as long as her uneasy form flitted about the room i clung to the partition listening determined that nothing should move me not even my own terrors and though night presently merged into midnight and the silence and horror of the spot became frightful i kept my post for the stealthy tread continued and so did the desultory scraps of conversation which proved that if the mother was waiting for the daughter to sleep the daughter was equally waiting for the mother to retire and so daylight came and with it exhaustion to more than one of us three watchers and this is the record of the first night spent by me in the secret chamber chapter xxii a surprise for honora october events crowd this morning the one girl i have taken into my confidence came to my room with a strange tale a stranger had arrived an elegant young gentleman of foreign appearance who had not yet given his name but who must be a person of importance if bearing and address go for anything he came on horseback attended by his valet and his first word after some directions in regard to his horse was a request to see the landlady when told she was ill he asked for the clerk and to him was about to put some question when an exclamation from the doorway interrupted them turning they saw madame standing there her face petrified into an expression of terrified surprise mrs hush sprang from the ladys lips before he could finish his exclamation and advancing she laid her hand on his arm saying in french which by the way my clerk understands if you hope anything from us do not speak the name that is faltering on your tongue for reasons of our own for reasons of a purely domestic nature we are traveling incognito let me ask you as a gentleman to humor our whim and to know us at present as madame and mademoiselle letellier he bowed but flushed with embarrassment and mademoiselle she is well i trust quite well and yourself quite well also may i ask what has brought you into these parts whom we thought in another and somewhat distant country need you ask they had drawn a little apart by this time and the clerk heard no more but their manner the ladys especially was so singular that he thought i ought to know that she was here under a false name and so had sent margery to me with the news as for the gentleman and madame letellier they were still conversing in the lowest tones together interested intensely in this new development in the drama hourly unfolding before my eyes i dismissed margery with an instruction or two and passed into the hidden chamber where i again laid my ear to the wall the mother would have something to say when she returned and i determined to hear what it was i had to wait a long time but was rewarded at last by the sound of voices and the distinct exclamation from the daughters lips oh mamma what has happened the mothers reply was delayed but it came at last my face is becoming strangely communicative you will read all my thoughts next what makes you think anything has happened is this a place for occurrences oh mamma you cannot deceive me your very limbs are trembling see you can hardly stand and then how you look at me oh mamma dear is it good news or bad for from your eyes it might be either has he he he always he the mother passionately interrupted you do not love your mother you are thinking always of one whom you never saw till a year ago my doubts my fears my sufferings are nothing to you i might die hush hush whenever did you speak like this before mamma love you did ever a child love her mother more but our affection is sure while that of him you do not like me to mention is threatened and its existence forbidden i cannot help but think mamma and of him if i could i were a traitor to the noblest instincts that sway a womans heart i may not marry him you say i never will but think of him i must and pray for him i will till the last breath has left my lips so what is your news dear mamma has papa written it is too early for the mail true true some one has come then a messenger perhaps from new york m dubois dubois is a traitor he has not kept the secret of our whereabouts we have to settle with monsieur and madame dubois meanwhile what honora can i trust you trust me ah who is trembling now i i but how can i help it you glance toward the door you seem afraid some one will come you you tut do not mind me answer what i ask could you see the marquis talk to him hear him urge his love and plead for yours without forgetting that your obedience is mine and that you are not to give him so much as the encouragement of a glance till i either give you permission to do so or command from you his immediate and unqualified dismissal see him it was all the poor girl had heard yes see him you have come from paris why not he since dubois has proved himself a traitor oh mamma came now in great sobs you are not playing with me he has come he is here the horse i heard stop at the door was that of the marquis acknowledged the mother he is in the sitting room child but he does not expect you at present this evening you shall see him if you will promise me what i have asked otherwise he must go i will have no complications arising out of a secret betrothal if you have not sufficient strength oh i have strength mamma i have strength only let me see him and prove to myself that he is not worn by trouble and suspense and i will do all you ask of me ah how well i feel what a beautiful what a lovely day this is must i not go out till evening may i not take one wee walk in the garden not one my child at nine oclock you may go to the sitting room for a half hour till then think over what i have said and prepare your lips to be dumb and your eyes to remain downcast for i am firm in my demands and nothing will make me change them you may trust me there was despair in the tones now as they talked but little after this and as i was greatly interested in seeing the young man who had been heralded by such glowing descriptions i stole back to my room and putting on a green shade hastened to join my guests in the front part of the house one glance from beneath my hurriedly uplifted shade was sufficient to assure me as to which of the gentlemen there assembled was the one i sought so frank a face so fine a form so attractive a manner were not often seen in my inn and prepossessed at once in his favor i advanced to the owner of all these graces and calling him by name bade him welcome to my house he must understand our language well for he immediately turned with gentle urbanity and discerning perhaps something in my face which assured him of my sympathy and respect entered into a fluent conversation with me that at once increased my admiration and awakened my pity for i saw that his nature was strong and his feelings deep and as the future could have nothing but shame and misery i instinctively felt oppressed by the fate which awaited him he did not seem to feel any apprehension himself his eyes were bright his smile beaming his bearing full of hope now and then his glance would steal toward the door or through the open windows as if he longed to catch a glimpse of some passing face or form and at last swayed by that sympathy which we women all feel for true love in man or woman i asked him to accompany me into the garden promising him a view that would certainly delight him as the garden was plainly visible from the oak parlor you can readily understand to what view i alluded but he had no suspicion of my meaning and followed me with some reluctance but his aspect changed materially when in walking up and down the paths i casually remarked this is the least inhabited side of the inn only one room is occupied and that by two foreigners madame and mademoiselle letellier yet it has a pleasant outlook as you yourself can see is she are they behind those windows he asked with an impetuosity i could not but admire in a man with so much to recommend him to the consideration of others i beg your pardon he added a moment later after a stolen glance at the house i know those ladies and anything in connection with them is interesting to me i believed it and had hard work to hide my secret trouble but his preoccupation assisted me and at length i found courage to remark they are from paris i understand a fine woman madame letellier must be much admired in her own land he seemed to have no reason for resenting my curiosity she is was his quick reply she is not only admired but respected i have never heard her name mentioned but with honor i am happy to be known as her friend i gave him one quick look good god what lay before this man and he so unconscious i felt like wishing the inn would fall to atoms before our eyes crushing beneath it the sin of the past and his false hopes for the future he saw nothing he was smiling upon a rose which he had plucked and was holding in his hand this inn is one of the antiquities i now observed anxious to know if any hint of its secrets had ever reached his ears they say it is one of the first structures reared on the river have you ever heard any of the traditions connected with it oh no he smiled the happygolucky is quite a stranger to me you cherish up all its legends though i have no doubt are there any tales of ghosts among them i can easily imagine certain disembodied spirits wandering through its narrow halls and up and down its winding staircases what spirits i asked convinced however by his manner that he was talking at random with the probable aim of prolonging our walk within view of the window behind which his darling might stand concealed madame must inform me i have too little acquaintance with this country to venture among its traditions there is a story i began but here a finely modulated but piercing voice rang musically down the paths from the house and we heard your eyes will certainly suffer mrs truax if you let the hot sun glare upon them so mercilessly and turning we saw madames smiling face looking from her casement with a meaning that struck us both dumb and led me to shorten our walk lest my interest in the romance then going on should be suspected and my usefulness thus become abridged was it to forestall my suspicions rid herself of my vigilance or to insure herself against any forgetfulness on her daughters part that madame some two hours later sent me the following note dear mrs truax i can imagine that after your walk in the blazing sunlight you do not feel very well this evening i must nevertheless request of you a favor my need being great and you being the only person who can assist me the marquis de la rocheguyon with whom i saw you promenading has come to this place with the express intention of paying court to my daughter as i am not prepared to frown upon his suit and equally unprepared to favor it i do not feel at liberty to refuse him the pleasure of an interview with my daughter and yet do not desire them to enjoy such an interview alone as i am ill quite ill with a sudden and excruciating attack of pain in my right hip may i ask if you will fulfill the office of chaperon for me and without embarrassment to either party take such measures as will prevent an absolute confidence between them till i have obtained the sanction of my husband to an intimacy which i myself dare not encourage very truly your debtor if you accomplish this madame letellier illustration chapter xxiii in the secret chamber have only twentyfour hours elapsed is it but yesternight that all the terrible events took place the memory of which are now making my frame tremble so the clock says and yet how hard it is to believe it madame letellier but i will preserve my old method i will not anticipate events but relate them as they occurred to go back then to the note which i received from madame i did not like it i did not see its consistency and i did not mean to be its dupe if she intended remaining in the oak parlor then over the oak parlor i would keep watch for from her alone breathed whatever danger there might be for any of us and to her alone did i look for the explanation of her mysterious presence in a spot that should have held a thousand repellent forces for her and hers as for her sudden illness that was nonsense she was as well as i was myself had i not seen her standing at the window an hour or two before but here i made a mistake madame was really ill as i presently had occasion to observe for not only was a physician summoned but word came that she wished to see me also and when i went to her room i found her in bed her face pallid and distorted with pain and her whole aspect betraying the greatest physical suffering it was a rheumatic attack affecting mainly her right limb and made her so helpless that for a moment i stood aghast at what looked to me like a dispensation of providence but in another instant i began to doubt again for though i knew it was beyond anybodys power to simulate the suffering under which she evidently labored i was made to feel by her penetrating and restless looks that her mind retained its hold upon its purpose whatever that purpose might be and that for me to relax my vigilance now would be to give her an advantage that would be immediately seized upon i therefore held my sympathies in check and while acting the part of the solicitous landlady watched for that glance or word which should reveal her secret intentions her daughter whose eyes were streaming with tears stood over her like a pitying angel and not till we had done all we could to relieve her mother and subdue her pain did she allow her longing eyes to turn toward the clock that beat out the passing moments with mechanical precision it was just a quarter to nine the mother saw that glance and hid her face for a moment then she took mademoiselle by the hand and drawing her down to her whispered audibly i expect you to keep your appointment mrs truax will send one of the girls to sit with me besides i feel better and as if i could sleep only remember your promise dear no look no hint of your feelings mademoiselle flushed scarlet stealing a look at me she drew back embarrassed but oh how joyous i felt my old heart quiver as i surveyed her and in spite of the dread form of the redoubtable woman stretched before me in spite of the grewsome room and its more than grewsome secrets something of the fairy light of love seemed to fall upon my spirit and lift the darkness from the place for one short and glowing moment look in the glass the mother now commanded you need to tie up your curls again and to put a fresh flower at your throat i do not wish you to show weariness mrs truax these words to me in low tones as her daughter withdrew to the other side of the room you received my note i nodded you will do what i ask i nodded again deliberate falsehood it was but i showed no faltering then i will excuse you now i rose and do not send any one to me i wish to sleep and anothers presence would disturb me see the pain is almost gone she did look better your wishes shall be regarded i assured her if you do feel worse ring this bell and margery will notify me and placing the bell rope near her hand i drew back and presently quitted the room lingering in the hall just long enough to see the lovely honora flit across the threshold of the sittingroom which i had purposely ordered vacant for her use i hurried to my room it was dark dark as the secret chamber into which i now stole with the lightest and wariest of steps horror gloom and apprehension were in the air which brooded stiflingly in the narrow spot and had it not been for the righteous purpose sustaining me i should have fallen at this critical moment crushed beneath the terrible weight of my own feelings but one who has to listen straining every faculty to catch the purport of what is going on behind an impenetrable wall soon forgets himself and his own sensations as i pressed my ear to the wall and caught the sound of a prolonged and painful stir within i only thought of following the movements of madame who i was now sure had left her bed and was dragging herself with what difficulty and distress i could but faintly judge by the involuntary groans which now and then left her across the floor toward the door the key of which i presently heard turn this done a heavy silence followed then the slow dragging sound began again interrupted now by weary pants and heavy sobs that at first chilled me and then shook me with such fear that it was with difficulty that i could retain my place against the wall she was crawling in my direction and at each instant i heard the pants grow louder i gradually withdrew step by step till i found myself pressed up against the wall in the remotest corner i could find and here was i standing enveloped in darkness and dread when the sounds changed to that of a shuddering rushing noise which i had heard once before in my life and from a narrow gap through which the faint light in the room beyond dimly shone in a thread of lesser darkness the aperture grew till i could feel rather than see her form crawling not walking through the opening and hear distinct enough her horrible gurgling tones as she murmured i shall have to grope for what i want touch it feel it for i cannot see o god o god what horror what punishment nearer nearer over the floor she came dragging her useless limb behind her her outstretched arm groped groped about the floor while i stood trembling and agonized with horror till her hand touched the skirt of my dress when with a great shriek of suddenly liberated feeling i pushed her from me and crying out murderess do you seek the bones of your victim i flung open the door against which i stood and let the light from my own room stream in upon us two her face as i saw it at that moment has never left my memory she had fallen in a heap at my first move and now lay crushed before me with only her widestaring eyes and shaking lips to tell me that she lived you thought i did not know you i burst forth you thought because i had never seen your face you could come back here bringing your innocent daughter with you and cast yourself into the very atmosphere of your crime without awakening the suspicion of the woman whose house you had made a sepulcher of for so many years but crime was written too plainly on your brow the spirit of honora urquhart breaking the bounds of this room has walked ever beside you and i knew you from the first moment that you strayed down this hall broken sounds unintelligible murmurings were all that greeted me you are punished i went on in the misery of your daughter nemesis has reached you the blood of honora urquhart has called aloud from these walls and not yourself only but the still viler being whose name you have so falsely shared must answer to man and god for the life you so heartlessly sacrificed and the rights you so falsely usurped mercy came in one quick gasp from the crushed heap of humanity before me but i was inexorable i remembered honora urquharts sweet face and at that moment could think of nothing else so i went on you have had years of triumph you have borne your victims name worn your victims clothes sported with your victims money and he her husband has looked on and smiled day after day month after month year after year you have gone in and out before your friends unmolested and unafraid but gods vengeance though it halts is sure and keen across land and across water the memories of this room have drawn you and not content with awakening suspicion you must make suspicion certainty by moving a spring unknown even to myself and entering this spot from which the bones of your victim were taken only two months ago marah leighton moved by the name she stood up tottering and agonized with pain but firm once more and determined she towered before me her face turned toward the room she had left her hand lifted her whole attitude that of one listening hark she cried it was a knock a faint low trembling knock that we heard then the word mamma came in muffled accents from the hallway a convulsion crossed the countenance of the miserable woman before me oh god my daughter my daughter she cried and falling at my feet she groveled in anguish as she pleaded will you kill her she knows nothing suspects nothing the whole fifteen years of her life are pure she is a flower i love her i love her though she looks like the woman i hated and killed she bears her name why i do not know i could not call her anything else she is my living reproach and yet i love her do you not see it was for her i crossed the water for her i plunged my living hand into this tomb to learn if our secret had ever been discovered and if there was any hope that she might yet be made happy ah woman woman you are not a wretch a demon you will not sentence this innocent soul to disgrace and misery even if i must die and i swear that i will die if you say so leave to my child her hopes keep secret my sin and take the blessing of the most miserable being that crawls upon the earth as a solace for your old age hear me hear a wretched mothers plea it is too late i broke in even were i silent there are others upon your track i doubt if your husband does not already know that the day of his prosperity is at an end she gave a low cry and tottered from the place entering her own room she threw herself upon the bed i followed drawing the curtains about her then closing the door of communication between the oak parlor and the chamber beyond i passed to the door behind which we could yet hear her daughters soft voice calling and unlocking it let the radiant creature in oh mamma she began i could not keep my word but here i held up my hand and drawing her softly out told her that her mother needed rest just now and that if she would come to my room for a little while it would be best and so prevailed upon her that she promised to do what i asked though i saw her cast longing glances through the partly opened door toward the somber bed so like a tomb and which at that moment was a tomb had she known it a tomb of hope of joy of peace for evermore i was just going out when a slight stir detained me looking back i saw a hand thrust out from between the falling curtains just a hand but how eloquent it was pointing it out to mademoiselle i said your mothers hand give it a kiss mademoiselle but do not part the curtains she smiled and crossed to that ominous bed kneeling she kissed the hand which thereupon raised itself and rested on her head in another instant it was drawn slowly away and with a startled look the halfweeping daughter rose and glided again to my side as i closed the door i thought of those words and the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children to the third and fourth generation chapter xxiv the marquis but the events of the night are not over as soon as i had seen mademoiselle comfortably ensconced in my old room up stairs i returned to the sitting room where the marquis still lingered he was standing in the window when i entered and turned with quite a bright face to greet me but that brightness soon vanished as he met my glance and it was with something like dismay that he commented upon my paleness and asked if i were ill i told him i was ill at ease that events of a most serious nature were transpiring in the house that he was concerned in them heavily grievously that i could not rest till i had taken him into my confidence and shown him upon what a precipice he was standing he evidently considered me demented but as he looked at me longer and noted my steady and unflinching gaze he gradually turned pale and uttered in irrepressible anxiety the one word honora miss urquhart is well i began and is as ignorant as yourself of the shadows that hover over her she is all innocence and truth sir honor candor and purity dwell in her heart and happiness in her eyes yet is that happiness threatened by the worst calamity that can befall a sensitive human being and if you hold her in esteem ma foi he broke in with violent impetuosity i do not esteem her i love her what are these dreadful secrets how is her happiness threatened tell me without hesitation for i have entreated her to be my wife and she she thinks it is a parents whim alone which keeps her from responding fully to your wishes i finished but madames objections have deeper ground than that miserable woman as she is she has some idea of honor left she knew her daughter could not safely marry into a high and noble family and so what is this you say came again in the quick and hurried tones of despair mrs urquhart wait i broke in you call her mrs urquhart but she has no claim to that title she and edwin urquhart have never been married he recoiled sharply with a gesture of complete disbelief how do you know he demanded they are strangers to you i have known them in their own home all the world credits their marriage and all the world does not know what transpired in this house sixteen years ago when edwin urquhart stopped here with his bride on his way to france he stared seemed shaken but presently hastened to remark ah madame you acknowledge that she is his wife you said bride one does not call a woman by that name without acknowledging a marriage service the woman he brought here was his bride edwin urquhart is no common criminal marquis de la rocheguyon it was hard to make him understand it was hard to undermine his trust step by step inch by inch till he found no hope no shred of doubt to cling to but it had to be done if only to avert worse calamities and more heartrending scenes he must know at once and before he took another step in relation to miss urquhart just what her position was and to what shame and suffering he was subjecting himself by accepting her love and pledging his own the task was not done till i had shown him this diary of mine and related all that had just occurred in the room below then indeed he seemed to comprehend his position and completely crushed and horrorstricken subsided into a dreadful silence before me the lines of years coming into his face as i watched him till he became scarcely recognizable for the lordly and lighthearted cavalier whose dreams of love i had so fearfully interrupted some half hour or so before from this lethargy of despair i did not seek to rouse him i knew when he had anything to say he would speak and till he had faced the situation and had made up his mind to his duty i could wait his decision with perfect confidence in his fine nature and nice sense of honor you may therefore imagine my feelings when after a long delay an hour at least he suddenly remarked we have been a proud family from time immemorial we have held ourselves aloof from whatever could be thought to stain our honor or impeach our good name i cannot drag the unfathomable disgrace of all these crimes into a record so pure as that of the rocheguyon race though i had wished to bestow upon my wife a name and position of which she could be proud i must content myself with merely giving her the comfort of a true heart and such support as can be provided by a loving but unaccustomed hand marquis i commenced but he cut my words short with a firm and determined gesture my name is louis de fontaine he explained henceforth my cousin will be known as the marquis it is the least i can do for the old french honor twas so simply so determinedly done that i stood aghast as much at the serenity of his manner as the act which required such depth of sacrifice from one of his traditions and rearing then you continue to consider yourself the suitor of miss urquhart i stammered you will marry her though her parents may be called upon to perish upon the scaffold in an ignominy as great as ever befell two guilty mortals the answer came brokenly but with unwavering strength did you not say that she was innocent is she to be crushed beneath the guilt of her parents am i to take the last prop from one so soon to be bereft of all the supports upon which she has leaned from infancy if i cling to her she may live through her horror and shame but should i fail her great heavens would we not have another life to answer for before god besides he added with the simplicity which marked his whole bearing i love her i could not do otherwise if i would to this final word i could make no rejoinder with a reverence unmingled with the taint of compassion i took my departure and being anxious by this time to know how my young charge was bearing her seclusion i went to the room where i had left her and softly opened the door chapter xxv mark felt subjected as i have been in the last three hours to distress and turmoil i was delighted to find mademoiselle asleep and to behold her peaceful face gazing at it and noting the happy smile which unconsciously lingered on her lips i could not but feel that despite the hideous revelations which lay before her her lot was an enviable one allied as it promised to be with that of one of such high principles as the marquis though i am old now and have had my day the love of the innocent and pure is sacred to me and in this case it certainly has the charm of a spotless lily blooming in the jaws of hell as it was late and i was almost exhausted i began to think of rest but my uneasiness in regard to madame would not let me sleep till i had made another visit to her room so leaving the gentle sleeper lapped in serenest dreams i proceeded to descend once more as i passed the great clock on the stairs i noticed that it was almost midnight and began to hasten my steps when i heard a loud knock at the front door this is not an infrequent sound with us but it greatly startled me this night i even remember pausing and looking helplessly up and down the hall as if it were a question whether i should obey the unwelcome summons but such knocking as speedily followed could not be long ignored so subduing my impatience i hastened to the door and unlocking it threw it open a gust of rain and wind greeted me this was my first surprise for i had not even noticed that the weather was unpleasant so completely had i been absorbed by what had been going on in the house my next was the bearing and appearance of the stranger who demanded my hospitality for though both face and form were unknown to me there was that in his aspect which stirred recollections not out of keeping with the unhappy subject then occupying all my thoughts yet i could not speak his name or put into words the anticipations that vaguely agitated me and led him through the hall and into the comfortable sitting room so lately vacated by the marquis with no more distinct impression in my mind than that something was about to happen which would complete rather than interrupt the horrors of this eventful night and when the light fell full upon him and i could see his eager eyes this feeling increased and no sooner had his cloak fallen from his shoulders and his hat left his head than i recognized the prominent jaw and earnest face and putting no curb on my impetuosity i exclaimed at once and without a doubt mr felt the utterance of this name seemed to cause no surprise to my new guest the same he replied and you are mrs truax of course mr tamworth has described you to me also this inn till i feel as if i knew its every stone i did not wish to visit it but i could not help myself an unknown influence has been drawing me here for days and though i resisted it with all my strength it finally became so powerful that i rose from my bed at night saddled my horse and started in this direction i have been twenty hours on the road but part of these i have spent in the thicket just over against you on the opposite side of the road for the sight of the house awakened in my mind such a disturbance that i feared to show myself at the door a voice out of the air seemed to cry not yet not yet nevertheless i could not go back nor leave the spot which once seen possessed for me a fatal fascination i was speechless good god were the old psychological influences at work and had they acted upon him at forty miles distance you come from albany i at last stammered forth you must have had a wet time of it it storms heavily i see storms he repeated glancing at the cloak he had thrown off great heaven my cloak is saturated and i did not even know it rained a touch of the old spell he murmured something is about to happen to me something has drawn me with purpose to this house i felt awestruck would he guess next what that something was at eleven oclock he went on with the abstracted air of one recalling an experience i felt a pang shoot through my breast i had been looking steadfastly at these walls and somewhere about the building a light seemed to go out for a pall of darkness suddenly settled upon it simultaneously with the cessation of that imaginary cry which had hitherto detained me where was that light mrs truax and what has happened here that i should feel myself called upon to cross this threshold tonight i did not answer at once for i was trembling was i to be subjected to another such an ordeal as i had experienced earlier in the evening and be forced to prepare by such means as lay in my power a much abused man for a most dreadful revelation it began to look so what has called me here he repeated danger to her or death to him they are thousands of miles away and tamworth could not have yet reached them but peril of some deadly nature menaces them i know a stroke has gone home to him or her and it is in this place i am to learn it is it not so mrs truax perhaps i tremblingly assented there is a gentleman here from france who may be able to tell you something of the man and the woman you mean would it affect you very much to hear disastrous news of them i cannot say he answered it should not mr tamworth tells me that he has acquainted you with the story of my life do you think i should feel overwhelmed at any retribution following a crime that was committed almost as much against me as against the pure and noble being who was the visible sufferer i shrink from answering i returned the human heart is a curious thing if he alone were to suffer ah he was the bitter ejaculation or if she i proceeded were bound by no ties appealing to the sympathies but she is a mother good god i had not thought it would affect him so and stood appalled a mother he repeated she she the tigress the heartless one with no more soul than the naked dagger i should have plunged into her breast and did not great heaven and this child has lived i suppose is grown up and and is the sweetest purest most unworldly of beautiful women that these eyes have ever rested upon i thought he would spring upon me he leaned forward with so much impetuosity how do you know he asked and my heart stood still at the question because i have seen her i presently rejoined because i have had opportunities for studying her heart she is called honora and she is like miss dudleigh only more beautiful and with more claims to what is called character he did not seem to take in my words you have been to france he declared no i corrected miss urquhart has been here he fell back then started forward again opened his lips and stared wildly half fearfully about the room here he repeated evidently overcome at the idea why did they send her here i should as soon have expected them to send her into the murk of the bottomless pit a girl an innocent girl you say and sent here they had reason besides she did not come alone this time he understood me oh he shrieked she in the house i might have known it he went on more calmly i did only i would not believe it her crime has drawn her to the place of its perpetration she could not resist the magnetic influence which all places of blood have upon the guilty she has come back and he i shook my head the man had less courage i declared perhaps because he was more guilty perhaps because he had less love love it was love for the daughter which drew the mother here not the spell of her crime or the accusing spirit of the dead the woman who wronged you has some heart she was willing to risk detection and with it her reputation and life to see if by any possibility she could venture to give happiness to the one being whom she really loves explain i do not understand how could she hope to find happiness for her child here by settling the question which evidently tortured her by determining once for all whether the crime of sixteen years back had ever been discovered and if she found it had not to satisfy at once her own pride and her daughters heart by giving that daughter to as noble a gentleman as ever carried a sword and they are here now they are here and she has discovered the futility of all her hopes he drew back and his heavy breath echoed in deep pants through the room what an end for marah leighton he gasped what an end and she is here he went on after a moment of silent emotion under this roof no wonder i felt myself called hither and she knows her crime is detected how came she to know this did you recognize her and tell her i recognized her and told her there was no other course we met in the secret chamber whither she had come to make her own terrible investigations and the sight of her there on the spot where she had left the innocent to die was too much for my sense of justice i accused her to her face and she crouched before me as under the lash there was no possibility of denial after that and she now lies wait he cried catching me painfully by the arm when was this day today tonight not two hours ago his brow took on a look of awe you see he murmured she has power over me yet when her hope broke something snapped within me here i abhor her but i feel her grief she was once all the world to me i recognized his right to emotion and did not profane it by any words of mine instead of that i sought to leave him but he would not let me go till he had asked me another question and the daughter he urged does she know of the opprobrium which must fall upon her head she sleeps i replied with a smile of the shyest delight upon her lips her lover has followed her to this place and the last words she heard tonight were those of his devotion her suffering must come tomorrow yet it will be mitigated for he will not forsake her whatever shame may follow his loyalty i have his word for that then the earth holds two lovers was mark felts rejoinder i thought it held but one and with a sigh he let go my arm and turned to the window with its background of driving rain and pitiless flashes of lightning i took the opportunity to excuse myself for a few minutes and hurrying again into the hall hastened with nervous fear and an agitation greatly heightened by the unexpected interview i had just been through to the now oftopened door leading into the oak parlor i found it closed but not locked and pushing it open listened for a moment then took a glance within all was quiet and ghostly a single candle guttering on the table at one end of the room lent a partial light by which i could discern the funereal bed and the other heavy and desolatelooking articles of furniture with which the room was encumbered honoras flowers withering on the window seat spoke of tender hopes not yet vanished from her tender dreams but elsewhere all was hard all was dreary all was inexorably forbidding and cold i shuddered as i looked and shuddered still more as i approached the bed and paused firmly before it madame letellier it was the only name by which i could bring myself to address her at that instant there is one gleam of brightness in your sky the marquis knows the story of your guilt yet consents to marry your daughter i received no reply shaken by fresh doubts and moved by an inexplicable terror i stood still for a moment gathering up my strength then i repeated my words this time with sharp emphasis and scarcely concealed importunity madame said i the marquis knows your guilt yet consents to marry your daughter but the silence within remained unbroken and not a movement displaced the somber falling curtains agitated beyond endurance i stretched forth my hands and drew those curtains aside an unexpected sight met my eyes there was no madame there the bed was empty chapter xxvi for the last time my eyes turned immediately in the direction of the secret chamber its entrance was closed but i knew she was hidden there as well as if the door had been open and i had seen her what should i do for a moment i hesitated then i rushed from the room and hastened back to mr felt i found him standing with his face to the door eagerly awaiting my return what has happened he asked importunately your face is as pale as death because death is in the house madame ah lies not in her bed nor is she to be found in her room there is another place however in which instinct tells me we shall find her and if we do we shall find her dead in her daughters room at her daughters bedside no in the secret chamber he gazed at me with wild and haggard aspect you are right he hoarsely assented let us go let us seek her it may not be too late the entrance to this hidden room was closed as i have said and as i had never assisted at its opening i did not know where to find the hidden spring by means of which the panel was moved we had therefore to endure minutes of suspense while mr felt fumbled at the wainscoting the candle i held shook with my agitation and though i had heard nothing of the storm before it seemed now as if every gust which came swooping down upon the house tore its way through my shrinking consciousness with a force and menace that scattered the last remnant of selfpossession not an instant in the whole terrible day had been more frightful to me no not the moment when i first heard the sliding of this very panel and the sound of her crawling form approaching me through the darkness the vivid flashes of lightning that shot every now and then through the cracks of the closely shuttered window making a skeleton of its framework added not a little to its terror there being no other light in the room save that and the flickering almost dying flame with which i strove to aid mr felts endeavors and only succeeded in lighting up his anxious and heavily bedewed forehead oh oh was my moan this is terrible let us quit it or go around to my own room where there is an open door but he did not hear me his efforts had become frantic and he tore at the wainscoting as if he would force it open by main strength you cannot reach her that way i declared perhaps my hand may be more skillful let me try but he only increased his efforts i am coming marah i am coming he called and at once as if guided by some angels touch his fingers slipped upon the spring immediately it yielded and the opening so eagerly sought for was made go in he gasped go in and so it was that the fate which had forced me against my will and in despite of such intense shrinking to pass so frequently into that hideous spot where death held its revel and nemesis awaited her victim drove me thither once again and as i now hope for the last time for there upon the floor and almost in the same spot where we had found lying the remains of innocent honora urquhart we saw as my premonition had told me we should the outstretched form of the unhappy being who had usurped her place in life and now in retribution of that act had laid her head down upon the same couch in death she was pulseless and quite cold upon her mouth her left hand lay pressed as if with her last breath she sought to absorb the pure kiss which had been left there by the daughter she so much loved chapter xxvii a last word did marah leighton will the coming of her old lover to my inn on that fatal night that is the question i asked when with the first breaking of the morning light i discovered lying on the table under an empty phial a letter addressed not to her husband nor to her child but to him mark felt it is a question that will never be answered but i know that he comforts himself with the supposition and allows the trembling hope to pass at times across his troubled spirit that in the bitterness of those last hours some touch of the divine mercy may have moved her soul and made her fitter for his memory to dwell upon the letter i afterward read it was as follows to the man who gave all bore all and reaped nothing but suffering i am not worthy to write you even with the prospect of death before me but an influence i do not care to combat drives me to make you of all men the confidant of my remorse i did not perish sixteen years ago in the hudson river i lived to share in and profit by a crime that has left an indelible stain upon my life and an ineffaceable darkness within my soul you know or soon will know what that crime was and how we prospered in it daring as it was dreadful i heard its fearful details planned by his lips without a shudder because i was mad in those days mad for wealth mad for power mad for adventure the only madness i did not feel was love this i say to comfort a pride that must have been sorely wounded in those days as sorely wounded as your heart edwin urquhart could make my eyes shine and my blood run swiftly but not so swiftly as to make me break my troth with you had he not sworn to me that through him i should gain what moved me more than any mans love how he was to accomplish this i could not see in the beginning and was so little credulous of his being able to keep his oaths that i let myself be drawn by you almost to the church door but i got no further there in the crowd he stood with a command in his eyes which forbade any further advance though i comprehended nothing then i obeyed his look and went back for my heart was not in any marriage and it was in the hopes to which his looks seemed to point later he told me what those hopes were he had been down to long island and while there had chanced to hear in some tavern of the happygolucky inn and its secret chamber and he saw or thought he saw how he could make me his without losing the benefit of an alliance with miss dudleigh and i thought i saw also and entered into his plans though they comprised crime and entailed horrors upon me from which woman naturally shrinks i was hard as the nether millstone of which the bible speaks and went determinedly on in the path of dissimulation and crime which had been marked out for me till we came to this inn then owing perhaps to my long imprisonment in the dreadful box i began to feel qualms of physical fear and such harrowing mental forebodings that more than once during that terrible evening i came near shouting for release but i was held back by apprehensions as great as any from which a premature release from my place of hiding could have freed me i dared not face honora and i dared not subject edwin urquhart to the consequences of a public recognition of our perfidy and so i let my opportunity go by and became the sharer as i was already the instigator of the unheardof crime by which i became in the eyes of the world his wife what i suffered during its perpetration no word of mine can convey i cringed to her moans i shook under the blow that stifled them and when all was over and the bolts which confined me were shot back and i found myself once more on my feet and in the free air of this most horrible of rooms i looked about not for him but her and when i did not see her or any token of her death i was seized by such an agony of revulsion that i uttered a great and irrepressible cry which filled the house and brought more than one startled inquirer to our door for retribution and remorse were already busy within me and in the lurking shadows about the fireplace i thought i saw the long and narrow slit made by the halfclosed panel standing open between me and the secret place of her entombment and though it was but an optical delusion the panel being really closed it might as well have been the truth for i have never been able to rid myself of the sight of that chimerical strip of darkness with its suggestions of guilt and death it haunted my vision it ruined my life it destroyed my peace if i shut my eyes at night it opened before me if i arrayed myself in jewels and rich raiment and paused to take but a passing look at myself in the glass this horror immediately came between me and my own image blotting the vision of wealth from my eyes so that i went into the homes of the noble or the courts of the king a clouded miserable thing seeing nothing but that black and narrow slit closing upon youth and beauty and innocence forever and forever and forever my child came ah that i should have to mention her here i do it in penance i do it in despair since with her my heart woke and for her that heart is now broken never to be healed again oh if the knowledge of my misery wakens in you one thought that is not of revenge cast a pitying eye upon this darling one left in a hateful country without friends without lover without means for friends and lover and means will all leave her with the revelations which the morning will bring and unless heaven is merciful to her innocence as it has been just to my guilt she will have no other goal before her than that which has opened its refuge to me as for her father let heaven deal with him he gave me this darling child so i may not curse him even if i cannot bless marah october i have seen one bright thing today and that was the faint and almost unearthly gleam which shot for a moment from beneath honoras falling lids as i told her what love was and how the marquis only awaited her permission to speak to assure her of his boundless affection and his undying purpose to be true to her even to the point of assuming her griefs and taking upon himself the protection of her innocence if it had not been for this i should have felt that the world was too dark to remain in and life too horrible to be endured november i thought that when honora urquhart left my house to be married to m de fontaine in the church below the hill peace would return to us once more but there is no peace this morning another horrible tragedy defiled my doorstep i was sitting in the open porch waiting for the mail coach for it seemed to me that it was about time i received some word from mr tamworth it was yet some minutes before the time when the rumble of the coach is usually heard and i was brooding as was natural over the more than terrible occurrences of the last few weeks when i heard the clatter of horses hoofs and looking up and down the road saw a small party of men approaching from the south as they came nearer i noticed that one of the riders was whitehaired and presumably aged and was interesting myself in him when he came near enough for me to distinguish his features and i perceived it was no other than mr tamworth rising in perturbation i glanced at the men behind and abreast of him and saw that one of these rode with lowered head and oppressed mien and was just about to give that person a name in my mind when the horse he bestrode suddenly reared bolted and dashed forward to where i sat flinging his rider at the very threshold of my house where he lay senseless as the stone upon which his head had fallen for an instant both his companions and myself paused aghast at a sight so terrible and bewildering then amid cries from the road and one wild shriek from within i rushed forward and turning over the head looked upon the face of the fallen man it was not a new one to me though changed and seamed and white now in death i recognized it at once it was that of edwin urquhart this noon i took down the sign which has swung for twenty years over my front door happygolucky is scarcely the name for an inn accursed by so many horrors february this week i have fulfilled the threat of years ago i have had the oak parlor and its hideous adjunct torn from my house now perhaps i can sleep march news from honora the distant relative who succeeded to the estates and the title of the marquis de la rocheguyon has fallen a victim to the guillotine would this have been the fate of honoras husband had he forsaken her and returned home there is reason to believe it at all events she finds herself greatly comforted by this news for the sacrifice which her husband made to his love and no longer regrets the exile to which he has been forced to submit for her sake wonderful wonderful providence i view its workings with renewed awe every day september i have been from home i have been on a visit to new york i have tasted of change of brightness of free and cheerful living and i can settle down now in this old and fastdecaying inn with something else to think about than ruin and fearful retribution i have been visiting madame de fontaine she wished me to come i think that i might see how amply her married life had fulfilled the promise of her courtship days though she and her noble husband live in peaceful retirement and without many of the appurtenances of wealth they find such resources of delight in each others companionship that it would be hard for the most exacting witness of their mutual felicity to wish them any different fate or to desire for them any wider field of social influence the marquis i shall always call him thus has found a friend in general washington and though he is never seen at the presidents receptions or mingles his voice in the councils of his adopted country there are evidences constantly appearing of the confidence reposed in him by this great man which cannot but add to the exiles contentment and satisfaction honora has developed into a grand beauty the melancholy which her unhappy memories have necessarily infused into her countenance have given depth to her expression which was always sweet and frequently touching she looks like a queen but like a queen who has known not only grief but love there is nothing of despair in her glance rather a lofty hope and when her affections are touched or her enthusiasm roused she smiles with such a heavenly brightness in her countenance that i think there is no fairer woman in the world as i am assured there is none worthier her husband agrees with me in this opinion and is so happy that she said to me one day i sometimes wonder how my heart succeeds in holding the joy which heaven has seen fit to grant me in it i read the forgiveness of god for the unutterable sins of my parents and though the shadows will come and do come whenever i think upon the past or see a face which like yours recalls memories as bitter as ever overwhelmed an innocent girl in her first youth i find that with every year of love and peaceful living the darkness grows less as if somewhere in the boundless heavens the mercy of god was making itself felt in the heart of her who once called herself my mother and hearing her speak thus i felt my own breast lose something of the oppression which had hitherto weighed it down and as the days passed and i experienced more and more of the true peace that comes with perfect love and perfect trust i found my tears turned to rejoicing and the story of my regrets into songs of hope and so i have come back comforted and at rest if there are yet ghosts haunting the old inn i do not see them and though its walls are dismantled its custom gone and its renown a thing of the past i can still sit on its grassgrown doorstep and roam through its fastdecaying corridors without discovering any blacker shadow following in my wake than that of my own figure bent now with age and only held upright by the firmness of the little cane with which i strive to give aid to my tottering and uncertain steps the grace of god has fallen at last upon the happygolucky inn illustration famous
