better than me the trip to spain was my first time with the orchestra in a foreign country whats the problem my friend adriana said from the seat behind me adriana plays the violin in the orchestra its my double bass i said frank cant find it im sorry frank said we put it in the bso truck in barston and it wasnt in the truck when it arrived in barcelona all the big instruments came by road it was cheaper than taking them in a plane he says someones taken it i told adriana i said perhaps someones taken it frank said thats no help at all i said i was angry perhaps isnt any good perhaps it fell off the truck perhaps someone wanted wood for their fire look adriana said this is stupid double basses are big they dont just fall off trucks this one did i said i looked out of the window of the coach we were arriving in barcelona my first foreign trip wonderful dont you think but thats just the problem it wasnt wonderful at all chapter two a beautiful day i woke up i looked around me

yes thats a great idea i was pleased it was going to be a good day after all i thought but i didnt know what was going to happen then did i chapter three a newspaper a beach while i was waiting for adriana in the hotel reception area i sat down at a table there were newspapers on the table most of them were in spanish or catalan but there was one from britain i began to read it there was a story about a painting thieves steal picture from gallery i looked up frank shepherd was standing next to my chair he was looking at the newspaper too thats an interesting story he said what story about the painting the thieves were very good i said nobody saw them in the gallery nobody heard them yes thats good all right frank said oh by the way about your double bass yes i said i talked to the police here a man called portillo and i asked hes going to try and find it frank said how i said i wanted my double bass back i dont know im not a policeman hes going to talk to the drivers of the truck i think and hes going to talk to the french police at that moment we heard a voice frank somebody shouted frank shepherd i want to talk to you i looked round candida ashleymorton the leader of the double basses was walking towards us excuse me said frank he walked up to candida and the two of them went towards the hotel bar candida was talking quickly was she angry i couldnt hear the conversation they went into the bar the lift doors opened and adriana got out with some of the other orchestra players somebody was shouting in the hotel bar it was candida ashleymorton she was shouting at frank there was a short silence then he shouted back everybody stood and listened come on adriana said to us its their problem not ours lets go to the beach and have some fun if you havent been to barcelona you must go the city feels good and theres lots to do one of the most famous areas of the city is a big street called les rambles or the ramblas in english people walk in the middle of this street cars go on the sides tourists walk up and down it it has trees and cafes street musicians and street actors people sell newspapers and flowers and birds in cages they try and sell you things or paint your picture its always full of life always full of people about twenty of us left the hotel that morning we walked down the ramblas we were talking and laughing at the bottom of the long street we walked past the boats and the restaurants and then we came to the beach it was a beautiful day the sun was already high in the sky there were a lot of people lying on the sand some of the orchestra ran to the sea and swam some began to play football on the beach adriana and i sat and watched we put on our sunglasses and smiled at each other wow she said this is fantastic this is the life she was right it was a fantastic day but we didnt know then about the future the future wasnt fantastic at all chapter four the concert concerts start late in spain it was half past nine and the theatre still wasnt full my face was red because of the days sun and it was very hot in the theatre at five to ten we walked on to the theatre stage and sat down the audience stopped talking our conductor philip worth walked on to the stage at ten oclock he lifted his arms and we started to play a piece of music called in the south by the english composer edward elgar i looked at all the people in the audience simon was near the front he smiled at me i was playing very well i was really happy except for simons poor hand of course after in the south we played a guitar concerto by the spanish composer rodrigo the guitarist was a young catalan player she was very good and everybody loved her then there was a break of twenty minutes before the second half of the concert the orchestra went into a room behind the stage we drank some water simon came in that was great he said youre playing very well thanks i said i was very happy its because of your instrument its because of you dont say that he laughed why i asked him its not true for a minute he didnt look happy sorry i said he smiled at me im going to sit at the back of the theatre for the second half he told me ok why i asked to hear a different sound he answered to hear you from the back of the theatre oh right i understand except i didnt really understand then he kissed my hand and i felt happy simon wasnt always nice to me see you later i said we played rachmaninovs third symphony after the break it is difficult music but i think we played it well the audience were very happy anyway i left the stage with simons double bass i put it into its big white case and closed it then i looked for simon but he wasnt in the theatre i went to the room behind the stage many of the orchestra players were there they were talking happily i waited for simon but he didnt come have you seen simon i asked adriana me no why she was a bit red in the face i told you it was a very hot night i cant find him i said looking at her he was at the front of the theatre for the first half then he went to the back now he isnt there hes probably at the hotel i hope so i told her and another thing she said wheres frank isnt he here i asked i dont think so she said i cant see him anyway i left the theatre with her we talked about the concert she said that everybody loved it yes i agreed it was really good we walked along the ramblas there were people out with their friends men and women boyfriends and girlfriends children it was a lovely night there was a man with a guitar a woman was dancing to his music people sat in the openair cafes and drank beer and wine its a bit late for children i said not here adriana said this was her third time in barcelona here everybody goes to bed very late well i cant understand it i answered im very tired i want to go to sleep ten minutes later we got to our hotel i didnt say goodnight to simon i couldnt find him do you want a drink adriana asked no thanks i really am very tired ok she said see you tomorrow morning i got into the lift and went up to my floor i thought about the concert i thought i played well when i got to my room i went to the telephone i tried a number no answer i put the telephone down i thought something was wrong i wasnt happy simon wasnt with me my lovely double bass wasnt with me oh well i thought maybe tomorrow will be better some people think the double bass is a funny instrument they say it just goes plonk plonk but its not true double basses are wonderful they look lovely and they have a warm sound like a friend they are different from other instruments too i mean one violin looks a lot like another violin cellos all look the same too well maybe theyre different colours but most people think they look the same so do trumpets but not double basses some are tall and thin some are short and fat each one is a different person each one has its own sound my double bass is a dark rich brown its very old it looks really beautiful if you play it well it makes a special sound and it is worth a lot of money i love it more than anything else its a panormo made in my parents bought it for me what am i going to do without my beautiful panormo i thought and where is simon what is happening to me i was very tired i fell asleep chapter five screams in the night i was asleep but my head was full of pictures and stories i was dreaming about double basses and violinists and parties on the beach simon was in my dream our conductor was in it so was my old teacher playing a double bass on the sand then i heard a different sound somebody was shouting no it was worse than that somebody was screaming screaming very loudly i opened my eyes i woke up it was five oclock in the morning somebody screamed again and again and again this time i wasnt dreaming i got out of bed i put on a tshirt and some jeans and went out of my room doors were opening on the left and the right adriana came out of her room she ran up to me she was half asleep still in her nightdress what is it she asked sleepily whats going on i dont know i answered martin audley a trumpet player came up to us who screamed he asked nobody knows i told him but it sounded terrible there was another scream it came from outside we ran back into my room and looked out of the window down at the street there was a police car there some people more and more people and something else come on i said we got the lift to the ground floor when it stopped we ran out of the hotel and pushed to the front of all the people marilyn whittle the harp player was already there her face was white and her eyes were large and round look look she said she was pointing in front of her she screamed again we looked she was pointing at the person at her feet it was frank shepherd his mouth was open there was blood all over his head martin spoke first my god he said hes dead for a few minutes nobody did anything it was like a moment from a bad film i looked around me candida ashleymorton was there her face was white oh oh oh no she was saying and then she turned and walked back into the hotel we knew that we couldnt sleep we didnt know what to do but the hotel manager was a nice person he opened the bar at half past five in the morning we sat there we were all asking the same questions what happened how did frank die did he fall from his room we heard another police car a man came into the bar we stopped talking good morning he said my name is portillo inspector portillo his voice was cold so were his eyes but i also thought hes very goodlooking with his dark hair and those eyes then i felt bad because of frank now please listen everybody the policeman said mr shepherd is dead we cant change that so go to bed well talk tomorrow well i mean later today his english was very good outside it was getting light i was lying on my bed thinking about frank i was trying not to see the blood and his eyes open and dead i was trying not to but i couldnt stop someone knocked on my door i got up and opened it it was simon hello he said hi isnt it terrible yes he said poor frank where were you i asked after the concert where were you last night i went to a bar he said why i asked why why what a stupid question for a drink what did you do then i asked questions questions why all these questions his voice was different now what did you do then

a statement i dont know come on simon where were you i didnt want to ask all these questions but i couldnt help it all right all right he shouted look i went to a few bars ok i had a lot to drink a lot i walked back to the hotel very late about three in the morning when i got here i went up to my room quickly i wasnt feeling very well you see all those drinks were you with someone else havent you listened to me now he was really angry i didnt understand it oh simon im sorry i said im being stupid its just well you know yes he said he was quieter now its been a difficult night a difficult morning he smiled at me he kissed me but there was something wrong something wasnt quite right im going to go back to my room he said i need a shower see you later he walked out of the room without another word i looked at the closed door i thought about his words about his answers to my questions and then i thought why isnt he telling me the truth chapter six inspector portillo three and a half hours later on that same day i sat down with inspector portillo in the hotel dining room good morning miss wade he said good morning i answered i was a bit afraid why did he want to see me why were the police talking to everybody i know about you he said you do i asked yes youre the player with the double bass without the double bass i said yes he laughed but were looking for it will you find it i asked i hope so he isnt cold i thought hes very nice i like him then suddenly he changed now i have some questions for you why i asked that is not a very intelligent question he said someone has died we always ask questions so you think im stupid do you i was angry and very very tired no of course not i am very sorry he said i looked into his face he really was sorry forget it i said im just

that simon hunt i told him and did he did you spend the night together well no we didnt i said i wasnt enjoying this i see he put his pen in his mouth he didnt say anything for a moment then he looked into my eyes all right he said thats all you arent going to ask me any more questions i said i can go yes for now but dont go far nobody in the orchestra must leave barcelona stay near the hotel of course ill talk to you again he said he was smiling again all right oh yes i said good but i didnt feel good at all chapter seven secrets its going to be strange without frank adriana said yes i agreed very strange we were sitting in a cafe adriana was drinking an orange juice and i was drinking my third cup of coffee we both felt very sad youve been in the orchestra for two months adriana said ive been in it for three years frank was like a father to me he was a nice man yes i said we talked about frank we didnt talk about his body in the street but i remembered everything i remembered the screams i remembered the people in the street people running in the hotel martin candida adriana pictures pictures in my head i sat up some coffee fell on to my tshirt something in the pictures was wrong are you ok adriana asked yes no i needed time to think i didnt want questions from adriana listen penny she began yes i said oh nothing she replied then she looked up at someone behind me i turned round simon i said hello where have you been oh here and there he replied i was talking to some of the orchestra players about frank of course of course i said do you want to sit down sure adriana smiled at him he smiled back it was a special smile they had a secret just the two of them something that i did not know that nobody knew i turned away simon asked for a beer when it came he drank it very quickly what do you thinks going to happen adriana asked about what simon said about our concerts tomorrow here in barcelona then madrid bilbao adriana said what do you mean simon asked well my friend explained franks dead he was our orchestra manager hes been with the orchestra for twenty years how can we play tomorrow night without him but its an important concert tomorrow night i said more than two thousand people are coming yes thats a problem said a voice next to me i looked up martin audley was standing there martin said adriana she looked uncomfortable what are you doing here im looking for penny actually martin told her me i said yes martin said inspector portillo wants to speak to you again when i asked now this minute ill go then i looked at simon he wasnt smiling at all now i got up and walked away from the table i looked back martin was sitting with them now the sun was hot but i began to run i was running away from the picture in my head the picture of last night in the hotel but i couldnt stop the picture i was back in the hotel back in my room i heard the screams i ran out of my room other people ran out of their rooms other players adriana for example her room was six doors down from mine i could see her but now i remembered something else she came from her room but she wasnt the only one there somebody was in the room with her i saw him in the dark but i couldnt see him well who was it i thought of adriana in the cafe smiling at simon was that their secret i ran into the hotel inspector portillo was waiting for me i am very sorry he started but i have got some more questions so have i i said did somebody kill frank maybe he smiled a secret smile what do you mean by maybe have you found franks killer what do you know i asked miss wade he said theres something the police here always do something we have always done whats that i asked stupidly well we ask the questions you give the answers i think he was laughing at me is that all right with you he asked i didnt say anything that means yes i think now mr simon hunt is your boyfriend you said asked the inspector yes i answered and he plays the double bass too i believe yes i said is he a good bass player oh yes i said immediately hes better than me hes the number two the second best in the whole orchestra yes the inspector said somebody told me that why are we talking about simon i asked but he didnt answer me he just looked and looked sorry i said i remember you ask the questions you are a quick learner miss wade now i was sure he was laughing at me mr hunt didnt play in the concert last night did he he said suddenly no i told him i played in his place he lent me his double bass because i havent got mine with me yes he said i havent forgotten sorry of course not i said was he angry with me did simon hunt go to the concert he asked oh yes he was at the front i told him i was thinking of simons handsome face was he at the front all the time inspector portillo said no in the second half he sat at the back did you see him at the back his voice was cold again yes i mean no i wasnt sure its a big theatre and after the concert the inspector asked what did mr hunt do then he went to a bar well he went to three or four bars i think i told him did you see him at the hotel no look why are you asking all these questions about simon you should ask me about candida i said candida he said yes candida ashleymorton i said the leader of the double basses what about her i think i think that perhaps she killed frank i said well perhaps she didnt kill him but she knows something im sure why do you say that he asked well because i heard something she was very angry with him yesterday morning i told inspector portillo about the conversation between candida and frank in the hotel bar when i finished he sat back in his chair that is most interesting miss wade he said most interesting well yes so you must talk to them thank you said the police inspector i will think about it and penny i mean miss wade i am sorry about all the questions i got up and walked out of the room candida ashley morton yes perhaps she killed frank did the inspector believe that did i what was the truth twentyfour hours later i had the answer chapter eight a restaurant a fight that evening some of us went to a restaurant near the ramblas simon didnt come with us i have to see some people ill come back to the hotel later he told me i was sitting next to martin i like martin hes been in the orchestra for about six years adriana was at the other side of the table sometimes she smiled at me and i smiled back but all the time i was thinking was that simon in her room is she trying to be my friend and simons lover at the same time he wasnt in his room last night somebody was in hers oh no i thought why is life so difficult we finished our supper and paid the bill then we walked back up the ramblas adriana came up to me are you ok she said we were walking past a cafe now now i thought now is a good time for the question the question i want to ask her but at that moment we heard english voices we turned round candida ashleymorton was sitting at one of the tables marilyn whittle the harp player was standing up she was shouting at candida people were watching them was it you she was shouting did you push him out of the window no of course i didnt candida said quietly dont be stupid i think you did the harp player said you killed him because he didnt love you what are you talking about candidas face was white you loved him didnt you marilyn said her face was all red candida looked at the ground she didnt say anything didnt you screamed marilyn you were in love with him all right its true candida said frank and i were lovers there are you happy thats why you killed him marilyn shouted what are you talking about candida said again her voice sounded tired you killed him because he didnt love you anymore marilyn told her please stop everyones listening everybodys listening she said so what let them listen ill tell them a story about a man called frank shepherd i loved him too you know yes candida said quietly he told me thats not true the harp player shouted back he didnt tell you he didnt love you he loved me more than you he loved me stop it marilyn candida said go back to the hotel go back to your room you need some sleep sleep i cant sleep franks dead how can i sleep with a killer in the next room now listen marilyn you must stop this i wont stop it youre a killer a killer a dirty killer you pushed him out of that window because he loved me me he loved me marilyn was shouting louder and louder she had a terrible look in her eyes everybody on the street stopped to watch i didnt know what to do adriana walked over to the harp player stop it she said to her stop it and she hit marilyn hard in the face marilyn opened her mouth to say something then she closed it and ran out of the cafe go after her martin adriana said and martin followed the unhappy harp player into the night im sorry about that candida said im sorry its not true of course really its not true she was crying now lets talk about it tomorrow adriana said she put her arm around candida and we walked away up the ramblas towards our hotel i spent that night with simon he arrived an hour after we did he was nice to me he got into bed next to me and kissed my eyes he talked of love and i wanted to believe him he had a bottle of champagne with him but i wasnt happy i loved simon but i didnt feel good about it he was strange towards me sometimes he said things and did things which i didnt understand but he tried to love me i think he tried to love me that night perhaps because he knew something that i didnt know he knew that it was our last night together when i woke up he was gone chapter nine two men a truck and a double bass i couldnt find simon after breakfast i couldnt find him anywhere in the hotel the morning passed very slowly the orchestra players talked to each other but not much a few of us went for a walk but we didnt go far we were all waiting after lunch we all went back to the hotel dining room well nearly all of us philip worth our conductor walked into the room inspector portillo was with him good afternoon everybody said our conductor everybody stopped talking now as you know inspector portillo asked you all questions yesterday now he has some answers jorge jorge inspector jorge portillo that was the inspectors name i liked it thank you maestro said inspector portillo at this moment we dont know everything we have to talk to some more people but i will tell you my idea of the story i think it is the real story but he looked around the room some things are still not clear he looked at me and smiled you all came to barcelona by air he started because its quicker than a coach but the big instruments came in the bso truck with two drivers the double basses were in that truck of course they drove to dover and put the truck on the boat then they drove through france towards spain after twelve hours the truck drivers were tired they stopped at a cafe by the side of the road near toulouse in france they went into the cafe and had a cup of coffee and something to eat then a car arrived a big car i think it went up to the truck two men got out well we think it was two they went to the truck they opened it im sure they had the key then they saw it and they smiled what what did they see marilyn asked the double bass of miss penny wade said the inspector what what did they see i asked they saw your double bass miss wade why my double bass i didnt understand what he was talking about they werent looking for it were they oh yes inspector portillo said thats what they were looking for but who why how did they know it was my double bass i asked i think somebody wrote your name on the case the two men saw it and they took it from the truck i dont understand adriana said why did they take pennys double bass well i dont think they wanted miss wades instrument the inspector said they wanted the case the case martin said why did they want the case well actually inspector portillo said they didnt want the case they wanted something in the case what what was it i couldnt wait any longer a picture a picture what kind of a picture adriana asked it was a painting by the french artist cezanne its called the gardener somebody took it from the tate gallery in london oh yes i shouted i read about it in the paper its worth two million pounds wow thank you miss wade said inspector portillo i wasnt sure but i think he was smiling at me again i smiled back so somebody took the painting from the tate gallery and then somebody it wasnt the same person of course put it in miss wades double bass case why didnt they take the picture and leave the double bass i asked i dont know perhaps they didnt have time perhaps some people came out of the cafe but they closed the truck and drove away with miss wades bass in its big white case inspector martin said you say i think perhaps i dont know what do you know is this story true thats a good question inspector portillo replied yes but whats the answer martin said the answer is this miss wades double bass was in the truck when it left barston it wasnt in the truck when it got to barcelona the truck stopped for a long time only once and a french driver saw two men with something big and white there something like a double bass case how do you know that adriana asked the french police told us the inspector said wheres my double bass now i asked im sorry miss wade said inspector portillo but i dont know he liked me i thought he really was sorry what about the painting martin asked thats safe inspector portillo said the french police found it this morning in paris excuse me adriana said yes said inspector portillo you said frank died because of the truck but how why what do you mean did he die because of the painting did he put the painting in pennys double bass case or what those are all good questions inspector portillo replied they were our questions too at first we didnt understand why mr shepherd died did he fall out of that window did he jump did somebody push him did he have problems with a lover a friend was there an argument i looked over at candida ashleymorton her head was in her hands she was crying i think perhaps she really did do it inspector portillo was still speaking but then we talked to the hotel people we looked at the rooms and immediately we had a problem what problem martin asked the window in mr shepherds room was closed inspector portillo said he didnt like open windows candida said quietly that is correct inspector portillo looked at candida when he said this and a man cannot jump out of a closed window what are you saying martin asked i am saying that frank shepherd didnt jump out of the window of his room he fell from a different room there was silence in the hotel dining room now complete silence that was difficult for us the inspector said whose room was it we didnt know but then one of my men looked at everything on the hotel computer he looked at the telephone calls then he saw it somebody telephoned the police in london last night what was the room number he looked on the computer it was frank shepherds room frank shepherd telephoned london frank called the police in london marilyn asked why we asked the police in london the same question why did frank shepherd telephone you they told us wait a minute martin said i thought frank fell from somebody elses window but you said he telephoned from his room you are quite correct the inspector said he telephoned from his room then he went to somebody elses room whose candida asked do you know what happened to frank do you know the name of his killer oh yes we know we know and suddenly i knew too chapter ten why did you do it sometimes now i still cant believe what happened in barcelona i dont know the whole story of course but i know most of it simon did not stay for the second half of the concert in the theatre in barcelona that night no problem he thought penny saw me at the concert the orchestra saw me penny thinks im sitting at the back poor simon simon went to a bar to meet someone but frank was also in the bar frank needed a drink he needed to think about his problems you see frank loved candida but then marilyn decided that she loved frank too she sent him letters gave him things talked to him followed him everywhere frank didnt like marilyn following him he needed a drink simon didnt see frank frank didnt see simon either at first but the barman saw frank and later he saw a picture of frank on the television so he rang the police a tall frenchman came into the bar with a black bag perhaps thats when frank looked up and saw simon but he didnt speak to him frank knew that something wasnt right thank you monsieur hunt the frenchman said we have got the picture my friend is very happy he opened his bag he gave simon a large brown envelope frank was listening all this just for a cezanne painting simon laughed frank probably remembered the article in the newspaper the frenchman walked out of the bar simon looked into the envelope there was money in it a lot of money frank saw it too it was money for the gardener by cezanne of course frank didnt know the whole story then but we know now a rich man in france wanted it for his secret collection of art something else frank didnt know simons cousin worked at the tate gallery as a security guard she took the painting from the gallery she gave it to simon and he put it in my double bass case nobody looks for a painting in a double bass case in an orchestra truck simon went back to the hotel frank went to his own room first and made that phone call to london then he went to simons room perhaps he wanted to ask him why why did you do it perhaps he wanted to tell him to run i dont know but it wasnt a good idea to go to simons room simons window was open frank fell five floors to the ground the police found simon at barcelona airport he went there after his night with me the policeman walked through the police station i followed him it was very hot in the building we got to a door the policeman unlocked the door there was a different policeman in the room and simon hello simon said he looked terrible hello i said quietly how are you what do you think he said it wasnt a real question oh simon did you really kill frank i asked him yes no he was angry he fell well i pushed him why i asked i couldnt believe this he saw me in the bar simon said in an unfriendly voice he saw me with the frenchman he knew about the gardener why i shouted why did you do it i was very angry why did i do it money of course i wanted more money and why didnt you run i asked i did after frank fell i left the hotel but then i thought nobody knows it was an accident thats what people will say but i didnt know about his telephone call i didnt know that the police could see where his fingers were his fingerprints on the window of my room we sat in that room for a few more minutes we didnt look at each other whats going to happen to you i asked what do you think im going to be in prison for a long time i expect poor simon oh be quiet go away go away i dont want you in this room i dont want anybody here with me i dont want to see you again ever just get out i wanted to stay simon was not a good person but i loved him well i loved him once upon a time simon i said simon i but i didnt have any words in my head simon looked at the floor the spanish policeman looked out of the window i left the room when i walked out of the police station i didnt look back chapter eleven one more question we left barcelona i was very unhappy i thought about simon in prison we played concerts in madrid and bilbao we didnt play very well of course but we played on our last night in bilbao adriana and i went out after the concert are you going to be all right adriana said youve had a terrible time we were walking by the rio nervion bilbaos big black river adriana i said can i ask you something yes of course do you did you like simon before well i liked him were you very good friends what what are you asking like lovers adriana asked no yes no i dont know why did
