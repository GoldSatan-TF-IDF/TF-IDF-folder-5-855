chapter one the story of uncle elias in september my wife was visiting some of her family so i was staying with my old friend sherlock holmes in baker street it was a windy stormy evening and the rain was falling heavily outside suddenly there was a knock at the door i looked at my friend in surprise who can this be i asked if he comes on business in this weather its important said sherlock holmes come in he called a young man came in he looked wet tired and worried ive come to ask for help he said ive heard of you mr holmes people say you know everything i dont know what to do well sit down said holmes and tell me about yourself the young man sat down and put his wet feet near the fire my name is john openshaw my father joseph had a brother my uncle elias who went to live in america when he was young he made a lot of money there he didnt like the black americans so during the civil war he fought against the men from the north and with those from the south but when the south lost the war and there was equality for black people uncle elias left america so in he came back to england and went to live in a large house in the country he was a strange unhappy man he did not want any friends john openshaw went on and he often drank a lot but he liked me and when i was twelve i moved to uncle eliass house he was very kind to me i could go anywhere in the house but there was one small room at the top of the house which was always locked nobody could go into this room one day uncle elias got a letter from pondicherry in india i dont know anyone in pondicherry he said but when he opened the envelope five little orange pips fell on to his plate i began to laugh but stopped when i saw my uncles white face kkk he cried oh my god my god theyve found me what do you mean uncle i asked death he cried and ran upstairs i looked at the envelope which had three ks on the back there was no letter who sent it and why was my uncle so afraid uncle elias went immediately to the secret room and took out a box which also had three ks on it he burnt all the papers in the box and said to me john i know that im going to die soon my brother your father will have all my money and my house after my death and you will have it all when he dies i hope you can enjoy it but if not give it to your worst enemy im afraid that my money brings death with it i didnt understand what he meant and nothing happened for a few weeks so i did not feel so worried but my uncle was very afraid he stayed in his room most of the time and drank more than before he always locked all the doors carefully then one night he drank very heavily and ran wildly out of the house and in the morning we found him dead in a river the police said he killed himself but i knew he was afraid to die so i didnt think that was true holmes stopped the young man for a minute tell me he said when did your uncle get the letter from india and when did he die the letter arrived on th march and he died seven weeks later answered john openshaw thank you please go on said holmes after my uncles death my father moved into the house of course i asked him to look carefully at the locked room but we didnt find anything important chapter two more pips everything went well until a year later said john openshaw but one morning my father opened a letter to find five orange pips inside it what does this mean john he asked his face was white look i said theres kkk on the envelope those letters were on uncle eliass envelope too we were both shaking and afraid yes and this time it says put the papers in the garden which papers the papers in uncle eliass box he burnt them i said and where has this letter come from my father said he looked at the envelope dundee scotland well i dont know anything about pips or papers im not going to do anything father you must tell the police i said i remembered my uncles letter from india and i was very worried no theyll laugh at me lets just forget about it he replied three days later my poor father went to visit an old friend who lived some miles away but he never came back the police said that he was walking home in the dark when he fell down a hill he was badly hurt and he died soon after they decided it was an accident but i didnt agree i thought it was murder and i could not forget the five orange pips and the strange letters to my uncle and my father but ive tried to forget and ive lived alone in that house for nearly three years now then yesterday i got this the young man showed us an envelope with kkk on the back and five small orange pips you see he said it comes from east london and it says put the papers in the garden those are the words that were in the letter to my father so what did you do next asked holmes nothing answered openshaw he put his head in his hands i dont know what to do im afraid nothing cried holmes young man you must do something fast youre in danger well ive talked to the police said openshaw unhappily but they laughed at me they think that theres nothing to worry about how stupid they are cried holmes and why didnt you come to me immediately your enemies have had almost two days to make a plan havent you found anything which will help us well i found this in the locked room said john openshaw he showed us a small halfburnt piece of paper it was with my uncles papers its his writing look it says march th sent the pips to three people brown robinson and williams march th brown left march th williams left march th visited robinson and finished business with him thank you said sherlock holmes and now you must hurry home put this paper into your uncles box put in a letter which says that your uncle burnt all the other papers and put the box outside in the garden i hope your enemies will be happy with that and then you wont be in danger any more how are you going home by train from waterloo station replied openshaw therell be a lot of people in the streets so i think that youll be all right but be careful thank you mr holmes said openshaw ill do everything you say he went out into the dark night the wind and the rain chapter three kkk sherlock holmes sat silently and watched the fire then he said to me john openshaw is in real danger why did his uncle elias have to leave america because he had enemies when he came back to england he was afraid thats why he lived a lonely life and locked all his doors so carefully now where did those letters come from did you see the first from pondicherry in india the second from dundee in scotland and the third from east london i answered does that tell you anything asked holmes theyre all sea ports the writer was on a ship when he wrote the letters i replied i was pleased with my answer very good watson said holmes somebody sent some pips from india and arrived seven weeks later to kill uncle elias then he sent some pips from scotland and arrived three days later to kill johns father do you see why im worried now he has sent pips to john from london johns enemy is in london already good god holmes i cried who is this man more than one man i think they belong to the ku klux klan that explains the kkk havent you ever heard of it its a very secret group of americans from the south they wanted to stop equality for black people and to kill anyone who didnt agree with them the police couldnt stop them but in uncle elias who belonged to this secret group suddenly left america with all their papers and so the group could not go on of course the group wanted to get the papers back you remember the halfburnt paper that was uncle eliass american diary while he was working for the kkk he sent the pips to frighten those three men two left the country but one didnt so the kkk finished business with him or killed him the kkk always worked like that well i hope they wont kill young openshaw i said chapter four the last deaths but they did the next morning we read in the newspaper that john openshaw was dead a policeman found him in the river near waterloo station the police said it was an accident but holmes was very angry about it he came to me for help and those men murdered him im going to find them if its the last thing i do he said to me and he hurried out of the house in the evening when he came back to baker street he was tired but pleased watson he said i know the names of openshaws enemies and now im going to send them a surprise this will frighten them he took five pips from an orange and put them in an envelope on it he wrote sh for jc im sending the pips not from the kkk but from me sherlock holmes to captain james calhoun his ship is called the star he and his men are sailing back to georgia usa now how did you find him holmes i asked ships papers he said ive looked at hundreds of them today only one ship the star was in the three ports at the right times and this morning the star left london to sail back to georgia i found out that the captain and two of his men all americans werent on the ship last night so im sure they killed poor john openshaw when they arrive in america theyll get the pips and then the police will catch them sherlock holmes is a very clever detective but he can do nothing about the weather the winter storms at sea that year were worse than ever and so the star never arrived in georgia and nobody saw the captain or his men again the murderers of john openshaw did not get the pips but in the end death came to them the end
