chapter one there were three of them jerry jimmy and kathleen jerrys name was gerald and jimmys name was james and kathleen was never called by her name at all but cathy or puss cat when her brothers were pleased with her and scratch cat when they were not pleased and they were at school in a little town in the west of england the boys at one school and the girl at another they saw each other on saturdays and sundays at the house of a kind lady but it was one of those important houses where it is impossible to play so they looked forward to the holidays when they would all go home then they could be together all day long and play in the house and explore the hampshire forests and fields their cousin betty was expected there too betty got to the hampshire home first and the moment she got there she began to have measles so that the three children couldnt go home at all you may imagine their feelings it was absolutely impossible to spend seven weeks at miss herveys house so all three wrote home and said so this surprised their parents very much because they had always thought the children liked to go to dear miss herveys house however they were jolly decent about it as jerry said and let the boys go and stay at kathleens school where there was no one except the french teacher we must have some sort of play during the holidays said kathleen when she had unpacked and arranged the boys clothes in the drawers feeling very grownup lets write a book about what schools really are like people would read it and say how clever we were more likely expel us said gerald no well have an outofdoors game we could get a cave and keep stores in it there arent any caves said jimmy and besides mademoiselle wont let us go out alone dont worry said gerald ill go and talk to her it was a thin and interestinglooking boy that knocked at the door of the room where the french teacher sat reading a book gerald could always make himself look interesting when he met new grownups it was done by opening his grey eyes rather wide and having a nice expression i hope i am not disturbing you said gerald when he came in bat no she said what is it that you want i decided to come and say how do you do said gerald because you are the lady of the house you are a very polite little boy she said not at all said gerald more polite than ever i am so sorry for you because youll have to look after us in the holidays but not at all said mademoiselle in her turn i am sure you will be very good children well try he said honestly we dont want to give you any trouble at all and i was thinking it would be less trouble for you if we could go out into the woods tomorrow and take our dinner with us something cold you know mademoiselle laughed and gerald laughed too little deceiver she said why not say at once you want to be free of over watching you have to be careful with grownups said gerald your parents they permit these days at woods oh yes said gerald truthfully then i will not be more a dragon than the parents thank you said gerald is there anything we can do for you wind your wool or find your spectacles or he thinks me a grandmother said mademoiselle laughing more than ever well what luck the others asked its all right said gerald i told you it would be i dont believe you shes too stern said kathleen ah said gerald thats only because you dont know how to manage her she wasnt stern with me next morning the children went to explore the woods but are there any woods asked kathleen as they passed the marketplace it doesnt much matter about woods said gerald dreamily im sure well find something one of the boys told me his father said when he was a boy there was a little cave near the salisbury road but he said there was an enchanted castle there too so perhaps the cave isnt true either finally they came to a place where the road as gerald said went two ways at once that looks like adventures said kathleen and they turned to the right then turned to the left so as to be quite fair jimmy said and then to the right again and to the left again and so on till they were completely lost completely said kathleen how interesting the adventurers decided to sit down and have something to eat and as they sat and rested gerald leaned back against the bushes and almost fell over backward he stood up and said i couldnt feel anything but air its a hole there the other two pulled back the bushes there certainly was a hole in the bank im going in said gerald he put his knee on a stone and disappeared you all right asked jimmy yes come on he helped kathleen and jimmy to get in it is a cave said kathleen they could see that they were in a dark stone cave three or four yards long which turned then sharply to the right the adventurers turned the corner and saw a round arch they passed through the arch into a deep narrow passage whose banks were of stones on the top of the banks grew trees and the sunlight came through their branches turning the passage to a corridor of goldgreen at the end of it was another found arch quite dark inside above which rose rocks and grass and bushes its like a railway tunnel said james its the entrance to the enchanted castle said kathleen at the dark arch they stopped there are steps down said jimmy very slowly and carefully they went down the steps gerald struck a match and they saw a passage turning to the left they went on following their leader the passage was very dark i dont like it whispered jimmy then the children saw daylight that grew and grew the passage finally ended in another arch they passed through the arch and came to a marble terrace which was white in the sunlight it was a fantastic view like a picture out of a book about italy immediately below them was a lake with swans and an island beyond it were green slopes covered with trees and amid the trees they saw white statues to the left there was a round white building with pillars and to the right a waterfall away across the grassy slopes they saw deer it is an enchanted castle said kathleen i dont see any castle said jimmy what do you call that then gerald pointed to white towers beyond the trees it is an enchanted castle said gerald but there arent any jimmy was quite positive how do you know do you think theres nothing in the world but what youve seen i think magic went out when people began to have steam engines jimmy insisted and newspapers and telephones perhaps theres no magic because people dont believe in it anymore said kathleen well dont lets spoil the show with any silly old not believing said gerald with decision im going to believe in magic as hard as i can this is an enchanted garden and thats an enchanted castle and im going to explore them there never was such a garden out of a picture or a fairytale they passed quite close by the deer who only raised their pretty heads to look and were not afraid at all then they came into a rosegarden red and pink and green and white in the sun like a giants manycolored handkerchief the feeling of magic got thicker and thicker till they were almost afraid of the sound of their feet in the great silent place beyond the rose garden was a hedge with an arch cut in it and it was the beginning of a maze it was impossible to get to the middle of the maze again and again they found themselves at the arch it was when they found themselves there for the fourth time that jimmy suddenly cried oh wheres the dinner and then in silence they all remembered that the basket with the dinner had been left at the entrance of the cave lets go back said jimmy now this minute and get our things and have our dinner lets have one more try at the maze i hate giving things up said gerald whats that that was a red cotton thread gerald picked it up one end of it was tied to a thimble with holes in it and the other there is no other end said gerald with firm triumph its a clue thats what it is ive always felt something magic would happen someday and now it has i think the gardener put it there said jimmy with a princesss silver thimble on it look theres a crown on the thimble there was come said gerald if you are adventurers be adventurers he walked forward winding the red thread round his fingers as he went the red clue led them to the middle of the maze there was a sundial there and all round against the hedge a low wide marble seat the red clue ended in a small brown hand with rings on every finger the hand belonged to a lady who lay on the stone seat asleep in the sun she was wearing a wonderful rosygold silk dress a thin white veil with silver stars covered the face its the enchanted princess said gerald now really impressed i told you so its the sleeping beauty said kathleen it is look how oldfashioned her clothes are she has slept for a hundred years oh gerald youre the eldest you must be the prince and we never knew it she very gently lifted the edge of the veil and turned it back the princesss face was small and white it was surrounded by long black hair her nose was straight there were a few freckles on cheekbones and nose no wonder whispered kathleen sleeping all these years in all this sun but she is lovely not so dusty said gerald now jerry said kathleen firmly youve got to kiss and wake the princess not me declared gerald shed go for me the minute she woke up i can kiss her said jimmy im not a coward like some people and before gerald could say a word jimmy loudly kissed the princess on her pale cheek and now the three stood breathless waiting for the result and the result was that the princess opened large dark eyes stretched out her arms yawned a little covering her mouth with a small brown hand and said then the hundred years are over which of you is my prince that woke me from my deep sleep i did said jimmy fearlessly for she did not look as though she were going to slap anyone but you arent really a princess are you of course i am she answered look at my crown she pulled aside the veil and showed beneath it a crown decorated with diamonds how did you get past the dragons asked the princess gerald ignored the question i say he said do you really believe in magic and all that i ought to if anybody does she said and showed a little scar on her wrist from the spindle then this really is an enchanted castle of course it is said the princess how stupid you are she stood up lets go back to the castle she said and ill show you all my lovely jewels and things wouldnt you like that yes said gerald with hesitation but but what the princesss tone was impatient but were most awfully hungry oh so am i cried the princess i havent had anything to eat for a hundred years come along to the castle the mice have eaten everything said jimmy sadly he saw now that she really was a princess not they cried the princess you forget everythings enchanted here time simply stood still for a hundred years chapter two when the procession entered the castle the princess turned to her guests you just wait here a minute she said and dont talk while im away this castle is full of magic and i dont know what will happen if you talk and with that she ran out as jimmy said afterwards most un princess like showing as she ran black stockings and black shoes soon she returned with a tray which held some bread and cheese and a jug of water come along said the princess hospitably i couldnt find anything but bread and cheese but it doesnt matter because everythings magic here and unless you have some awful secret fault the bread and cheese will turn into anything you like what would you like she asked kathleen roast chicken said kathleen without hesitation the princess cut a slice of bread and laid it on a dish green peas asked the princess cut a piece of cheese and laid it beside the bread kathleen began to eat the bread cutting it up with knife and fork as you would eat chicken she didnt see any chicken and peas or anything but cheese and dry bread if i have an awful secret it is a secret even from me she told herself the others asked for roast beef and cabbage and got it she supposed though to her it only looked like dry bread and dutch cheese for herself the princess chose a piece of roast peacock its a game isnt it asked jimmy suddenly whats a game asked the princess frowning pretending its beef the bread and cheese i mean a game but it is beef look at it said the princess opening her eyes very wide yes of course said jimmy i was only joking bread and cheese is not perhaps so good as roast beef or chicken or peacock but bread and cheese is at any rate very much better than nothing at all everyone ate and drank and felt much better now said the princess you can come and see my treasures she got up and they followed her down the long hall to the great stone stairs under the stairs behind a heavy curtain there was a little door this is the door leading to my private apartments said the princess she opened the door and they went straight on in the dark soon they reached another door the princess took the key from the outside of the door put it in the keyhole and turned it the room they were in was small and high its ceiling was deep blue with gold stars the walls were of wood paneled and there was no furniture in it at all this said the princess is my treasure chamber but where asked kathleen politely are the treasures dont you see them asked the princess no we dont said jimmy you dont come that bread andcheese game with me not again if you really dont see them said the princess i suppose i shall have to say the charm close your eyes please and give me your word of honor you wont look till i tell you and that youll never tell anyone what youve seen the children gave their words of honor rather reluctant and closed their eyes wiggadil yougadoo begadee leegadeeve nowgadow said the princess rapidly then they heard a creaking noise shes locking us in cried jimmy your word of honor whispered gerald you may look said the voice of the princess and they looked the room was not the same room yet yes the blue ceiling was there but now the walls sparkled with white and blue and red and green and gold and silver there were shelves around the room and on them were gold cups and silver dishes and ornaments of gold and silver tiaras of diamonds necklaces of rubies emeralds and pearls the three children remained breathless openmouthed looking at the sparkling treasures all about them while the princess stood with a proud smile on her lips can i do magic or cant i she asked triumphantly you can oh you can said kathleen may we may we touch asked gerald all thats mine is yours said the princess and added quickly only of course you mustnt take anything away with you were not thieved said jimmy the others were already turning over the wonderful things on the shelves perhaps not said the princess but youre a very unbelieving little boy i say lets all dress up and you be princes and princesses too the children decorated themselves with diadems necklaces and rings kathleen stood quite still with a diamond bracelet raised in her hand i say she said the king and queen what king and queen asked the princess your father and mother said kathleen wont they be wanting to see you after a hundred years you know oh ah yes said the princess slowly i embraced my parents when i got the bread and cheese theyre having their dinner look here said gerald if youre sure your father and mother dont expect you lets go out and have a good game of something unless you can do any more magic tricks you forget said the princess im grown up i dont play games and i dont like to do too much magic at a time its so tiring besides we must put all these things back in their proper places as kathleen was putting the last shining ornament into its proper place she saw more rings and brooches and chains and other things and all were of ordinary metal whats all this rubbish she asked rubbish indeed said the princess why those are all magic things this bracelet anyone who wears it has got to speak the truth this chain makes you as strong as ten men what does this brooch do asked kathleen reaching out her hand the princess caught her by the wrist you mustnt touch she said if anyone but me touches them all the magic goes out at once and never comes back that brooch will give you any wish you like and this ring jimmy pointed oh that makes you invisible i say said gerald excited could you show us how some of the things act couldnt you give us each a wish no said the princess suddenly it cant give wishes to you it only gives me wishes but ill let you see the ring make me invisible only you must close your eyes while i do it they closed them count fifty said the princess and then you may look and then you must close them again and count fifty and ill reappear gerald counted aloud through the counting they could hear a creaking sound fortynine fifty said gerald and they opened their eyes they were alone in the room the jewels had disappeared and so had the princess that is magic said kathleen breathlessly gerald began counting again he and kathleen had both closed their eyes but somehow jimmy hadnt he didnt mean to cheat he just forgot and as geralds count reached twenty he saw a panel under the window open slowly i knew it was a trick he said to himself and at once closed his eyes like an honorable little boy on the word fifty six eyes opened and the panel was closed and there was no princess i believe theres a cupboard under the window said jimmy and shes hidden in it secret panel you know you looked thats cheating said the voice of the princess so close to his ear that he quite jumped i didnt cheat though the children heard her voice still there was no princess to be seen come back again princess dear said kathleen shall we close our eyes and count again dont be silly said the voice of the princess were not silly said jimmy you know youre only hiding if youre hiding as jimmy says youd better come out if youve really turned invisible youd better make yourself visible again said gerald do you really mean asked a voice quite changed that you cant see me no i tell you said jimmy you are really invisible look in the glass said gerald there was a silence and then the children heard a cry of despair oh oh oh i am invisible what shall i do take the ring off said kathleen suddenly practical another silence i cant cried the princess it wont come off but it cant be the ring i was only playing at magic i just hid in the secret cupboard it was only a game oh whatever shall i do a game said gerald slowly but you can do magic the invisible jewels and you made them come visible oh its only a secret spring and the paneling slides up oh what shall i do dont cry dear said kathleen let me go and tell the king and queen the your royal father and mother oh dont mock me said the poor princess you know that was only a game too like like the bread and cheese said jimmy triumphantly i knew that was but your dress and being asleep in the maze and oh i dressed up for fun because everyones away at the fair and i put the clue just to make it all more real i was playing at the sleeping beauty first and then i heard you talking in the maze and i thought what fun and now im invisible and i dont know what to do but if youre not the princess who are you asked kathleen im my aunt lives here said the invisible princess she may be home any time oh what shall i do perhaps she knows some charm oh nonsense said the voice sharply she doesnt belive in charms she would be so cross lets go out into the garden near the lake where its cool and we can discuss it gerald said kindly youll like that wont you lets go down to the temple of flora by the lake said the voice the three children and the invisible princess went down to the white marble temple of flora that stood close against the side of the little hill and sat down inside it it was cool and quiet there well said gerald first of all whats your name and if youre not a princess who are you im im said a crying voice im the housekeepers niece at the castle and my names mabel prowse thats exactly what i thought said jimmy without a shadow of truth because how could he the others were silent because they didnt know what to think of it well anyhow said gerald you live here yes said the voice oh yes i live here right enough but whats the use of living anywhere if youre invisible chapter three youll have to tell your aunt said kathleen kindly no no no moaned mabel invisibly take me with you i dont think that my aunt likes me very much ill leave her a note to say ive run away to sea girls dont run away to sea well what shall i do really said gerald i dont know what the girl can do let her come home with us and have tea oh yes said jimmy jumping up and have a good discussion after tea said jimmy but the aunt will think somethings happened to her so it has and shell tell the police and theyll look everywhere for me theyll never find you said gerald im sure said mabel aunt would rather never see me again than see me like this it might kill her ill write to her and well put it in the big letterbox at the gate as we go out has anyone got a pencil and paper gerald tore a page out of the notebook and gave mabel a small pencil the pencil began writing forming round clear letters on the page this is what it wrote dear aunt i am afraid you will not see me again for some time a lady in a car has adopted me and we are going straight to the coast and then in a ship it is useless to try to follow me goodbye i hope you enjoyed the fair mabel but thats all lies said jimmy no it isnt its fancy said mabel if i said ive become invisible shed think that was a lie anyhow mabel led the children by another and very much nearer way out of the park as they got back to school the first drops of rain fell mademoiselle came herself to open the door you are late she cried all goes well we are very sorry said gerald it took us longer to get home than we expected the children sat down to supper there were only three plates but jimmy let mabel have his it was strange to see the bread and butter flying about in the air and bite after bite disappearing and the spoon rising with baked apple in it and returning to the plate empty everyone was very hungry and asked for more bread and butter cook grumbled when the plate was filled for the third time itll be difficult to give mabel any breakfast said gerald mademoiselle will be here then shed have a fit if she saw bits of bacon fly in the air and disappear we shall have to buy things for mabel to eat in secret said kathleen our money wont last long said jimmy have you got any money ive not got much money was mabels reply but ive got a lot of ideas we will talk about everything in the morning said kathleen we must just say good night to mademoiselle and then you shall sleep in my bed mabel ill give you one of my nightgowns it was extremely strange kathleen thought to see the princesss clothes coming out of nothing first the veil appeared hanging in the air then the sparkling crown suddenly showed on the table then a sleeve of the pinky dress showed then another and then the whole dress lay on the floor each piece of clothes became visible as mabel took it off the nightgown lifted from the bed disappeared a bit at a time kathleen was just getting sleepy when she remembered that the maid who would come in the morning would see those wonderful princess clothes ill have to get up and hide them she said and as she lay thinking about it she fell asleep and when she woke again it was bright morning and eliza was standing in front of the chair where mabels clothes lay looking at the pink dress oh dont touch please cried kathleen where did you get that were going to use it for acting invented kathleen its given me for that here a bell rang and eliza had to go because it was the postman and she particularly wanted to see him and now said kathleen pulling on her first stocking we shall have to do the acting everything seems very difficult acting isnt said mabel and a stocking disappeared in the air i shall love it you forget said kathleen invisible actresses cant take part in plays unless theyre magic ones oh cried a voice ive got such an idea tell it us after breakfast said kathleen she brought mabel a piece of bread taken by gerald from the pantry mabel ate the bread and drank water from the tooth mug im afraid it tastes of cherry toothpaste said kathleen apologetically it doesnt matter replied mabel its more interesting than water i think red wine in ballads was rather like this were going to tell your aunt where you really are said kathleen she wont believe you i expect youll be sorry for it said mabel but come on and i say do be careful not to shut me in the door as you go out you nearly did just now mabels aunt was reading a pink novel at the window of the housekeepers room excuse me said gerald but i believe youve lost your niece not lost my boy said the aunt who was thin and tall we could tell you something about her said gerald no complaints please replied the aunt my niece has gone if shes played any tricks on you its only her lighthearted way go away children im busy did you get her note asked kathleen the aunt showed more interest than before but she still kept her finger in the novel oh she said so you saw her leave did she seem glad to go quite said gerald truthfully these romantic adventures do occur in our family said the aunt lord yalding selected me out of eleven candidates for the post of housekeeper here i have no doubt the child was changed at birth and her rich relatives have found her your mabels invisible said jimmy shes just beside me now i hate lies said the aunt in all its forms will you kindly take that little boy away i am quite satisfied about mabel but what will mabels father and mother say asked gerald mabels father and mother are dead said the aunt calmly all right he said well leave but dont say we didnt tell you the truth thats all you have told me nothing said the aunt none of you except that little boy who has told me a silly lie goodbye and on this they got away quickly why said gerald when they were outside the little court your aunts mad she doesnt care what becomes of you and believes that nonsense about the lady in a car i knew shed believe it when i wrote it said mabel shes not mad only shes always reading novels now ill tell you my great idea im not ungrateful but im rather hungry and you cant always take things for me from the pantry if you like ill go back and live in the castle together with the ghosts i am a sort of ghost now you know oh no said kathleen kindly you must stay with us if you could get the ring off you could go back said jimmy yes but i cant i tried again last night and again this morning said mabels voice what i mean to say now that i am invisible we can have adventures adventures said the brave pirate are not always profitable it was gerald who said this this one will be look here if jerry could make himself look common he could go to the fair and do conjuring he doesnt know any said kathleen i should do it really said mabel but jerry could look like doing it move things without touching them and all that only you mustnt all go people may wonder what children are doing all alone by themselves dont show that you know me said gerald try to look as if you came to the fair with grownups if you dont some kind policemen will take the little lost children by the hand and lead them home to parents the french teacher i mean lets go now said the voice so they went the fair was held about half a mile from the castle gates when they got near enough gerald went ahead to get something to eat he brought some nuts red apples small yellow pears sweets and two bottles of gingerbeer they ate and drank the boys were never tired of seeing mabel eat or rather of seeing the strange magiclooking disappearance of food which was all that showed of mabels eating im sure it will knock them said gerald again and again it did jimmy and kathleen were the first to go to the fair soon they saw a strange figure with its hands in its pockets it was gerald but at first they hardly recognized him he had taken off his tie and round his head like a turban was the red schoolscarf and his face and hands were bright black everyone turned to look at him gerald went up close to a longfaced woman who was sitting at the door of a small tent im a conjurer from india said gerald not you said the woman the backs of your ears are ail white are they said gerald how clever of you to see that he rubbed them with his hands that better thats all right what do you do conjuring said gerald look here if you help me with the show ill go shares lets first see how you do conjuring since youre so clever right you are said gerald firmly you see this apple well ill make it move slowly through the air and then when i say go itll disappear yes into your mouth get away with your nonsense he held out one of the little apples and the woman saw it move slowly along the air now go cried gerald to the apple and it went hows that he asked in tons of triumph the woman was excited the best ever saw she whispered im on mate if you know any more tricks like that a lot said gerald then he asked will you give me your shawl she gave him a red and black shawl and he spread it on the ground and seated himself crosslegged behind it the woman got a drum from the inside of the tent and beat it quite soon a little crowd gathered ladies and gentlemen said gerald i come from india and i can do tricks which youve never seen when i see two shillings on the shawl ill begin a few pennies fell on the shawl nine pence said gerald well ive got a generous nature i dont wish to deceive you i have an assistant but my assistant is invisible the crowd laughed now said he laying the nine pennies down on the shawl you keep your eyes on those pennies and one by one youll see them disappear and of course they did then one by one they were laid down again by the invisible hand of mabel bravo show us another cried the people now said gerald youve seen what i can do but i dont do any more till i see five shillings on this carpet and in two minutes seven shillings lay there and gerald did a little more conjuring the news of the conjurer had spread all over the fair more people came to look at him the woman stood looking more and more pleasant as she saw the money and beat her drum every time gerald stopped conjuring it was getting quite late and gerald who was very tired and quite satisfied with his share of the money was wondering how to get out of it theyll never let us get away i didnt think of that before he whispered to mabel she thought and told him what to do gerald asked the woman to divide the money which she did honestly enough now he said ill give you five shillings for your shawl seven shillings said the woman mechanically righto said gerald putting his heavy share of the money in his trouser pocket this shawl will now disappear he said picking it up he gave it mabel who put it on and of course it disappeared the audience was impressed now he said i come to the last trick of all i shall take three steps backwards and disappear he took three steps backwards mabel put the invisible shawl round him and he did not disappear the invisible shawl couldnt make him invisible yah cried a boys voice in the crowd look at him he knows he cant do it the crowd was crowding closer at any moment they might touch mabel and then anything might happen simply anything oh whispered mabel suddenly i can get it off not yes the ring come on young master give us something for our money a farmer shouted i will said gerald this time i really will disappear go into the tent he whispered to mabel push the ring under the canvas then go away and join the others when i see you with them ill disappear go slow and ill catch you up its me said a pale and real mabel in the ear of kathleen hes got the ring come on before the crowd begins to shout as they went out of the gate they heard the shouting of surprise and knew that this time gerald really disappeared later they heard footsteps on the road and next moment geralds voice spoke hello it said gloomily you made me jump take my ring off its not yours any more than ours anyhow said jimmy yes it is said mabel oh stop it said the tired voice of gerald beside her you cant have the ring i cant get it off chapter four the difficulty was not only that gerald was invisible now but that mabel who was no more invisible couldnt get into the house i cant go back to aunt i cant and i wont said mabel firmly but what shall we say to mademoiselle about you said gerald you could tell the truth said mabel she wouldnt believe it said cathy no said geralds voice we cant tell her but shes really nice lets ask her to let you stay the night because its too late for you to get home thats all right said jimmy but what about you i shall go to bed said gerald with a headache oh thats not a lie ive got one right enough id do something different from going to bed with a silly headache said jimmy unkindly what would you do asked the voice of gerald id be a burglar said jimmy cathy and mabel reminded him how wrong it was and jimmy replied well then a detective its exactly what i am going to do said gerald well go to the policestation and see what theyve got in the way of crimes they did and read the notices on the board outside two dogs had been lost and a purse also someone had stolen many silver plates twenty pounds reward offered for any information that may lead to the recovery of the missing property ill detect that said gerald here comes johnson he added ask him about it jimmy hello johnson he said and johnson replied hello what are you doing here this time of night the constable asked you should be at home now weve been to the fair said kathleen there was an unusual conjurer there heard about him said johnson all fake you know such is fame gerald standing in the shadow jingled the money in his pocket whats that the policeman asked quickly our money jingling said jimmy with perfect truth its well to have pockets full of money said johnson remarked well why havent you asked mabel why dont you get that twenty pounds reward ill tell you why i dont because you cant arrest a person on suspicion even if you know well who did the job and who do you think did it asked jimmy i dont think i know its a man known to the police for many crimes hes done but we never can get enough evidence against him well said jimmy after school ill come to you and be a detective just now i think wed better go home and detect our supper good night when the policeman disappeared in the policestation they heard geralds voice youve no more brains than a halfpenny bun he said no details about how and when the silver was taken but he told us he knew said jimmy yes thats all youve got out of him go home and detect your supper its all you can do whatll you do about supper mabel asked buns said gerald halfpenny buns i hope you can buy buns i cant go into a shop in this state while cathy and jimmy were in the shop gerald spoke to mabel about his plans of starting a detective career the invisible detective may not only find out about the purse and the silver but detect some crime that isnt even done yet i can follow suspiciouslylooking people and catch them redhanded oh suddenly cried mabel oh how awful i never thought of that before never thought of what asked gerald the window what window the paneledroom window at the castle we left it open and all the jewels and things there aunt never goes in i must go home now this minute when the others came out of the shop the situation was explained to them aunt will be cross said mabel sadly as we left the key inside the door shell have to ask the gardeners to get a ladder and i can help you said gerald ill climb in close the window and get out wont you be afraid mabel asked you can be caught no i cant be answered gerald he expected the question about danger from kathleen but all kathleen said was well goodbye well come and see you tomorrow mabel the temple of flora at halfpast ten leave the pantry window open for me so i can get in when ive done my detecting said gerald gloomily then he took the bag with the buns and caught mabels hand come on mabel jimmy and kathleen explained to mademoiselle that jerry had a headache and couldnt come to supper after supper they went to bed they didnt worry at all about their brother it was the aunt herself who opened the door to a very pale mabel she made a step towards mabel you naughty naughty girl she cried angrily how could you do this to me oh mabel thank heaven youre safe and with that the aunts arms went round mabel and mabels round the aunt as if they had never met before but you didnt seem to care about me this morning said mabel how do you know i was there listening dont be angry auntie my dear said the aunt slowly ive been in a sort of trance ive always been fond of you but i didnt want to spoil you but yesterday quite suddenly i felt as if you didnt matter at all i felt the same when i got your letter and when those children came and today i suddenly woke up and realized that you were gone it was awful oh mabel why did you do it it was a joke said mabel and then the two went in and the door was shut thats very strange said gerald outside looks like more magic to me theres more about this castle than meets the eye there certainly was as gerald was walking alone and invisible through the shadowy great garden to look for the open window of the paneled room he began to feel well not excited not surprised not worried but different he had an extraordinary feeling so difficult to describe and yet so real and so unforgettable the feeling that he was in another world the feeling was very wonderful perhaps you will feel it someday there are still some places in the world where it can be felt something white moved under a tree a white figure came out a creature with horns and goats legs and the head and arms of a boy and gerald was not afraid the white thing rolled on the grass and ran away across the lawn then gerald saw the pedestal of a statue empty the statues come alive he said and another white shape came out of the temple of flora and disappeared in the bushes then something enormously long and darkly grey came towards him slowly heavily the moon came out just in time to show its shape it was of those great dinosaurs which lived millions of years ago when they were masters of the world before man was it cant see me said gerald i am not afraid its come to life too he touched the side of its gigantic tail it was of stone it turned however at the touch but gerald also had turned and was running with all his speed towards the house it was fear that he ran from and not the moving stone beast he stood some time under the window then he climbed into the room once inside the room gerald turned for another look the statue stood calm on its pedestal everything was in its place now in the garden nothing moved how extraordinary said gerald i never thought i could go through a garden and dream like that he shut the window turned the key went out locked the door again and went to the end of the passage i wonder where the kitchen is said gerald he had quite forgotten that he was a detective he wanted only to get home and tell the others about that unusual dream that he had had in the garden he opened many doors but he could not find the kitchen at last he opened a door and someone inside said something gerald stood back against the wall as a man ran to look into the passage all right said the man with relief the door opened its heavy thats all i thought it was the police that time said another voice they closed the door again gerald did not mind he didnt like the look of those men he felt that they were dangerous and gerald had seen what he wanted to see by wonderful luck beginners luck he had discovered a burglary on the very first night of his detective career the men were taking silver out of two great boxes and packing it in sacks gerald turned and went away very carefully and very quickly what shall he do he stopped and thought hard then he took a pencil and a notebook and wrote you know the room where the silver is burglars are taking silver send a man for police i will follow the burglars if they get away before police arrive he hesitated a moment and ended from a friend this is not a sell then gerald tied the letter round a stone and threw it into the room where mabel and her aunt were having supper he saw the stone picked up the letter read nonsense said the aunt oh please send for the police like he says asked mabel like who says said the aunt whoever it is mabel moaned its true i know its true please wake bates i dont believe a word of it said the aunt but she asked bates to go for the police when the police arrived the door of the room was open and the silver was gone it was five in the morning when gerald finally got into his bed tired and cold master gerald it was elizas voice in his ears its seven o clock and another fine day and theres been another burglary oh she screamed as she came up to his bed kathleen came running from her room jimmy sat up in his bed whats up kathleen cried eliza sat down heavily on a box as she spoke at first his bed was all empty and black and he was not in it and when i looked again he was in it ill tell mamselle of you with your tricks look here said gerald slowly im going to tell you something can you keep a secret yes said eliza then keep it and ill give you two shillings but what were you going to tell me that about the two shillings and the secret and you must keep your mouth shut i will said eliza holding out her hand oh im so glad youre safe said kathleen when eliza had gone you didnt seem to care much last night said gerald coldly i cant think how i let you go i didnt care last night but i woke this morning and remembered how did you get visible jimmy asked it just happened when she called me the ring came off tell us all about everything said kathleen not yet said gerald mysteriously wheres the ring jimmy asked after breakfast i want to have a try now i expect its in the bed somewhere said gerald but it wasnt eliza had made the bed there was no ring there she said i swear chapter five on the way to the temple of flora the children decided to take a short rest and sat on the churchyard wall oh jerry said kathleen im simply dying to hear what happened last night gerald told them his story as he told it some of the white mystery and magic of the moonlit garden got into his voice and his words so that when he told of the statues and the great beast that came alive kathleen and jimmy listened to him open mouthed then came the thrilling story of the burglars and the warning letter gerald told the story with the greatest enjoyment and in detail the church clock struck halfpast eleven and they saw mabel i couldnt wait any longer she explained when you didnt come has anything more happened the burglars had gone when bates got to the room go on jerry said kathleen hes just got to where he threw the stone into your room mabel mabel climbed on to the wall youve got visible again quicker than i did she said gerald nodded and went on with his story i returned to the room soon the burglars came out they didnt see me and i saw them all right which way did they go asked mabel they passed across the park the stone things that come alive kept looking out from between bushes and under trees they saw the burglars but the burglars couldnt see them the stone things asked mabel gerald told her of the statues i never saw them come alive she said and ive been in the garden in the evening many times i saw them said gerald firmly i know i know said mabel what i mean to say is that they could only be visible when youre invisible you can be right agreed gerald the castle gardens enchanted but what i should like to know is how and why i say come on ive got to catch johnson before twelve but you can talk as we go said mabel oh it is so awfully thrilling this pleased gerald of course well i just followed they got out of the park the same way where we got in then they went through the place where the poor people live and right down to the river and i say we must run to catch johnson so the story stopped and the running began they caught johnson in his own backyard washing look here johnson said gerald whatll you give me if i help you to win that reward half said johnson but i dont believe any of your nonsense its not nonsense said gerald very impressively when you catch the burglars you just give me a quid for luck i wont ask for more im sure you do want something more off of me said johnson but dont you want the reward yourself you are right said gerald i want that you never tell anyone who told you let them think it was your own luck and farsightedness you see i found it out late at night in a place where i wasnt supposed to be johnson was now too interested and gerald told him how he had seen the burglars at yalding towers and how he had followed them i saw them hide the sacks and i know the other stolen things are in the same place and i heard them talk about when to take them away come and show me where said johnson no said gerald calmly if you go there now youll find the silver but youll never catch the thieves youre right there said the policeman well well a car will be waiting for them beyond the boat house at one o clock tonight theyll get the things out at half past twelve and you could catch them then it seems to me real enough said johnson hes not a liar none of us are its the chance of your lifetime do you agree i agree said johnson then when youre on duty you go down to the river and the place where you see me blow my nose is the place the sacks are tied to the posts under the water johnson said that he would go immediately the children were already at the river when they heard the policemans heavy boots gerald stopped at the end of a little landingstage and loudly blew his nose morning he said immediately morning said johnson got a cold ah i shouldnt have a cold if id got boots like yours said gerald admiringly look at them anyone would know your footsteps a mile off how do you ever get near enough to anyone to arrest them he whispered as he passed johnson thats the place and he left followed by the others weve brought a friend home to dinner said kathleen when eliza opened the door wheres mademoiselle gone to see yalding towers todays show day and hurry over your dinner its my afternoon out and my gentleman friend doesnt like to wait all right well eat very quickly gerald promised they kept their word the dinner was over in a quarter of an hour and now said mabel when eliza disappeared up the stairs wheres the ring i must put it back im very sorry were all very sorry began kathleen and then they told her how the ring was lost lets all look again we were rather in a hurry this morning so they looked and they looked in the bed under the bed under the carpet under the furniture they shook the curtains they explored the corners but found no ring then said mabel at last your housemaid have stolen it thats all i shall tell her i think so suddenly they heard knocking at the back door all the servants except eliza were away on their holidays so the children went together to open the door when they opened the door they saw a young man with his hat very much on one side his mouth open under his fair moustache and his eyes as nearly round as human eyes can be he wore a suit of a bright mustard color and a blue necktie his expression was that of a person who is being dragged somewhere against his will he looked so strange that kathleen tried to shut the door in his face but she couldnt do it there was something in the way leave go of me said the young man oh yes ill leave go of you it was the voice of eliza but no eliza could be seen who holds you asked kathleen she has miss replied the unhappy stranger eliza miss at least it sounds like her voice and it feels like her body but i cant see her thats what he keeps on saying said elizas voice hes my gentleman friend suddenly his hand dropped eliza had left go of him she pushed past the children but gerald caught her by the arm with one hand and whispered dont move and dont say a word if you do well whats to stop me from sending for the police eliza did not know what there was to stop him so she did as she was told and stood invisible and silent the mustardcolored young man stood looking at the children with eyes if possible rounder than before what is it he asked whats it all about if you dont know im afraid we cant tell you said gerald politely but ill give you a bit of advice you go home and lie down youll be all right tomorrow the suns very hot you know added mabel hasnt eliza gone out to meet me he asked elizas indoors said mabel she cant come out to meet anybody today you go home and lie down said kathleen im sure you must need it good afternoon good afternoon miss said the young man and went slowly away the children explained to eliza very carefully and quite kindly that she really was invisible and that if you steal rings you can never be sure what will happen to you is it forever moaned eliza no one will marry a girl he cant see no not for ever said mabel kindly i expect youll be all right tomorrow tonight i think said gerald well help you all we can and not tell anyone said kathleen not even the police said jimmy look here well have a picnic and well take eliza ill go out and get the cakes said gerald when mademoiselle came home they started off for yalding towers picnic parties arent allowed said mabel ours will be said gerald tea and the buns made an excellent picnic they sat in the garden till the sun set behind the line of black firtrees on the top of the slope and the white temple turned grey it would be a very nice place to live in said kathleen draughty said eliza a lot of steps to clean oh whats that what that white thing coming down the steps why its a young man in statuary the statues do come alive here after sunset said gerald calmly i see they do eliza did not seem at all surprised or alarmed theres another of them and many more i dont see any statues said jimmy dont you see gerald whispered the statues come alive when the sun goes down and you cant see them unless youre invisible and youre not afraid unless you touch them lets get her to touch one and see said jimmy in the darkness of the park the children could see the statues white and motionless but eliza saw other things oh she cried suddenly heres the dear little boy with the deer hes coming to me next moment she was screaming and running away come on cried gerald she touched it and then she was frightened just like i was run shell send everyone in the town mad if she gets there like that they ran but eliza was much ahead of them ill stop here see you tomorrow said mabel as they reached the terrace then they turned the corner of their own street and saw an unseen person trying to open the locked door of the school the church clock struck the halfhour halfpast nine said gerald pull at the ring perhaps itll come off now he spoke to the bare doorstep but it was eliza who suddenly held out a hand a hand that they could see and in the hand they saw the magic ring next morning elizas gentleman friend was waiting for her when she opened the door sorry you couldnt come out yesterday he said so am i what did you do she asked i had a headache said the gentleman friend i laid down most of the afternoon and what did you do oh nothing interesting said eliza then it was all a dream she said when he was gone but itll be a lesson to me not to take anybodys old ring again in a hurry so they didnt tell her about me behaving like i did said he as he went sun i think i hope it will not happen to me again chapter six johnson was the hero of the town it was he who had tracked the burglars and found the stolen silver it was gerald who went out after breakfast to buy the newspaper and who read aloud to the others the two columns about the policeman with perfect detective instincts as he read every mouth opened wider and wider how could he say all that said kathleen if it hadnt been for you they could do nothing jerry well said gerald you know after all he had to say something im glad i and he stopped youre glad you what it doesnt matter he said now what are we going to do today mabel will want her ring and you and jimmy want it too oh i know we havent been attentive to mademoiselle lately well go to the fair and buy her flowers the three children met mabel at the corner of the square where every friday there was a fair and you could buy fresh meat vegetables sweets toys mirrors and all sorts of other interesting things the sun was shining and as mabel said all nature looked smiling and cheerful they chose carnations a bunch of yellow ones a bunch of white ones and a bunch of red ones they took the carnations home and gerald knocked at the door of the drawing room where mademoiselle seemed to sit all day come in came her voice and gerald entered she was not reading on the table he saw a sketchbook and an open colorbox with all of our loves said gerald and laying the flowers down before her you are a dear child and before gerald could say anything she kissed him on the two cheeks are you painting he asked i am doing a sketch she answered and showed him a beautiful and exact sketch of yalding towers oh i say ripping was the critics comment may the others come and see the others came including mabel who stood behind the rest and looked over jimmys shoulder mademoiselle saw mabel and asked a friend from the town yes how do you do said mabel politely no im not from the town i live at yalding towers the name seemed to impress mademoiselle very much yalding towers she repeated but this is very extraordinary is it possible that you are then of the family of lord yalding he hasnt any family said mabel hes not married are you his niece then no said mabel im lord yaldings housekeepers niece but you know lord yalding no said mabel ive never seen him then he never comes to his castle i have never seen him but hes coming next week why doesnt he live there mademoiselle asked auntie says hes too poor said mabel and told the story as she had heard it in the housekeepers room how lord yaldings uncle had left all the money to lord yaldings cousin and poor lord yalding had only just enough to keep the old place in repair and to live very quietly somewhere else but how his uncle could be so cruel to leave him the castle and no money asked mademoiselle oh i can tell you that too said mabel lord yalding wanted to marry a lady his uncle didnt want him to a barmaid or a ballet lady or something and his uncle said well then and left everything to the cousin and you say he is not married no the lady went into a convent and this lord did not then look for his lady oh yes did said mabel but there are millions of convents you know and he had no idea where to look and they sent back his letters from the postoffice and it seems that one knows all in the housekeepers saloon said mademoiselle pretty well all said mabel simply it is nearly dinnertime said the french teacher your friend will be our guest and in her honor we will make a little feast my beautiful flowers put them into the water kathleen i run to buy the cakes wash the hands all and be ready when i return smiling and nodding to the children she left them and ran up the stairs look here said gerald this is jolly decent of her let us stay today indoors and play with her instead i think shes most awfully bored would she really like it kathleen wondered aunt emily says grownups never really like playing they do it to please us they little know gerald answered how often we do it to please them weve got to do that dressingup with the princess clothes anyhow said kathleen we can do it after dinner come on jimmy lets help eliza to lay the table they went it was lucky said gerald suddenly thought that the burglars didnt go for the diamonds in the treasurechamber they couldnt said mabel almost in a whisper they didnt know about them nobody knows about them except me and you aunt doesnt know i just found out the spring by accident and if the burglars do know said mabel itll all come out at the trial there wont be any trial said gerald thoughtfully no trial the burglars had been warned by someone and the police didnt catch them he said what a pity said mabel its a pity you think its a pity because it was me said gerald i couldnt help it i went to a prison once with father and after id shown the place to johnson i remembered that and i just couldnt how did you warn them said mabel i just shoved a paper under the mans door the one that i knew where he lived to tell him to lie low i know it was wrong but i couldnt help it dont tell the others they wouldnt understand why i did it i dont understand it myself i do said mabel its because youve got a kind and noble heart come on lets wash our hands its a pity the ring cant make invisible just parts of you the dirt for instance perhaps gerald said unexpectedly it wont make even all of you invisible again why not asked mabel you were invisible twentyone hours i was invisible fourteen hours and eliza only seven thats seven less each time and now weve come to zero it will be something different this time and theres another odd thing when youre invisible your relations dont love you look at your aunt and cathy didnt care about me going burgling we havent got to the bottom of that ring yet it was a real feast they had cakes and fruit and chocolates there were jokes and stories and laughter jimmy did conjuring mademoiselle told them stories of her own schooldays and drew pictures of everything they asked for till gerald asked her do you like acting the theatre i mean but yes i love it all right said gerald well act a play for you this evening if you like but certainly said mademoiselle amuse yourselves well my children but its you said mabel suddenly that we want to amuse because we love you very much dont we all of you yes said the others as mabel said it they found to their surprise that it was true you love the old french teacher impossible said mademoiselle youre not old said mabel and youre as lovely as a princess the children ran out of the room to get ready for the performance in the evening mademoiselle was invited into the dining room eliza held the door open before her and followed her in it was rather dark there the curtain concealed that part of the room which was the stage chairs had been placed across the other end of the room all the chairs in the house as it seemed mademoiselle started when she saw that many of these chairs were occupied by men and women with strange clumsy figures and all with hats on but whispered mademoiselle you have then invited other friends laughter answered her from behind the curtain its only part of the performance cried mabel eliza laughing turned on the light mademoiselle looked at the figure seated nearest to her half laughed half screamed and sat down suddenly oh she cried they are not alive eliza with a much louder scream had found out the same thing and announced it differently they have got no insides said she the seven members of the audience had indeed no insides to speak of their bodies were rolledup blankets their backs were broomhandles and their arm and leg were hockey sticks and umbrellas their hands were gloves filled with handkerchiefs and their faces were the paper masks painted in the afternoon by gerald and tied on to the round heads made of the pillows the faces were really ugly you have made yourself an audience yes bravo cried mademoiselle at this moment the curtain went up a voice said beauty and the beast there was a real stage the diningtables pushed close together and covered with pinkandwhite curtains the scene was simple but convincing you may imagine what beauty and the beast would be like acted by four children who had spent the afternoon arranging their costumes and so had left no time for rehearsing what they had to say yet they acted with great pleasure and the audience liked it mabel in her princess clothes was a real beauty gerald was a beast jimmy was a merchant and kathleen surprised even herself by the quickness with which she changed from one to the other of small roles fairies servants and messengers it was at the end of the second act that gerald put a ring into mabels hand and said goodbye dear beauty this is a magic ring that will give you anything you wish when you desire to return to your beast put on the ring and say your wish and you will be by my side beautymabel took the ring and it was the ring the curtain closed to warm applause from two pairs of hands its a pity those creatures we made are not alive said mabel we could get something like real applause then im glad they arent said gerald when i catch their paper eyes i fell awful it was the middle of the last act when it all happened mademoiselle began it she applauded the garden scene elizas fat red hands followed heavily and then someone else was applauding six or seven people nine faces instead of two were turned towards the stage and seven out of the nine were painted paper faces and every hand and every face was alive mabel looked at the audience in horror mademoiselle and eliza ran from the room curtain curtain quick cried beautymabel in a voice that wasnt mabels or the beautys jerry those things have come alive oh what shall we do jimmy and kathleen drew the curtains youve done it this time said gerald to worried mabel ive done it asked mabel i like that i knew something different was going to happen said gerald its turned into a wishing ring those uglywuglies have come alive because mabel wished it we must go and pull them to pieces theyre going out screamed kathleen walking out on their umbrella and broomstick legs you cant stop them jerry theyre too awful everybody in the town will be mad if we dont stop them cried gerald here give me the ring ill un wish them he took the ring from mabel cried i wish the uglies werent alive and ran to the door but nothing happened the hall was crowded with live things strange things all horribly short as broom sticks and umbrellas are short a white face with red cheeks looked up at him and wide red lips said something he could not tell what and it had said it four times before gerald could understand that this alive horror was saying calmly and politely can you recommend me a good hotel chapter seven the thing was alive and was asking a definite and a reasonable question you want a hotel gerald repeated stupidly a good hotel a good hotel said the painted lips im awfully sorry gerald went on politely but all our hotels shut so early about eight i think knock them up said the uglywugly gerald even now does not understand how that creature made of clothes could become a perfectly respectable person about fifty years old the kind of man who travels first class and smokes expensive cigars you cant gerald explained theyre all deaf every person who keeps a hotel in this town its a law only deaf people are allowed to keep hotels its because of the hops in the beer they are so good for earache the other uglywuglies were crowding round the lady in a tall hat said if not a hotel a room i do know rooms said gerald but the lady ugly wugly in the hat with flowers interrupted him what i want to know she said is where are the carriages we ordered i dont know said gerald but ill find out but we must go now he added you see the performance is over and they want to shut up the house and turn off the light lets go the uglywuglies went towards the front door ill try to do anything of course said gerald i could go with you and get you a lodging if youd only wait a few moments in the yard you see ive got an uncle whos quite mad and i have to give him his gruel at halfpast nine he refuses to eat out of any hand but mine gerald did not mind what he said you can tell lies to the uglywuglies because they are not real people and cannot be really deceived gerald went through the back door down the steps into the yard and the uglywuglies followed him some of them had boots but the ones whose feet were only broomsticks or umbrellas had problems with the stairs please wait under the balcony said gerald my uncle is very mad if he sees any strangers i mean even aristocratic ones i wont answer for the consequences perhaps said the lady in the hat with flowers nervously we could try to find rooms ourselves i dont recommend it to you said gerald as gloomily as he could the police here arrest all strangers its the new law i wouldnt like to see you in prison he added convincingly the uglywuglies gathered under the balcony gerald went up the stairs behind him in the yard there were seven impossible creatures before him in the silent house there were five frightened people of course the reason why gerald was not afraid was that he had the ring and as you have seen the person who wears it is not frightened by anything unless he touches that thing but gerald knew well enough how the others must feel cathy i say jimmy mabel he cried in a loud cheerful voice that sounded very unreal to himself the diningroom door opened are you alone whispered kathleen yes of course where are they have you unwished them we heard them talking horrible theyre in the yard said gerald with the best imitation of excitement that he could manage it is such fun theyre just like real people quite kind and jolly look here kathleen and jimmy must go to bed and ill take mabel home i must find some place where the uglywuglies could stay now ill speak to mademoiselle and eliza he put on his coat as he spoke and now ran up the stairs the others gathered in the hall could hear his knock at mademoiselles door his words its only me gerald the pause the opening of the door and the talk that followed then mademoiselle and gerald went to elizas door trying to calm her down i wonder what lies hes telling them said jimmy oh not lies said mabel hes only telling them as much of the truth as its good for them to know im so sorry you were frightened gerald was saying it was a good trick wasnt it well so it was said mabel it was indeed a wonderful trick said mademoiselle and how did you move the figures oh weve often done it with strings you know gerald explained thats true too kathleen whispered can you do this remarkable trick again asked mademoiselle oh ive cleared them all out said gerald so he has said kathleen to jimmy we thought you wouldnt like to see them again mademoiselle entered the diningroom and saw that the figures had indeed disappeared then gerald explained to her that it was his duty to escort mabel home the moment that front door was shut gerald led mabel to the corner of the side street which led to the yard just round the corner he stopped now he said what i want to know is are you an idiot or arent you idiot yourself said mabel mechanically im not frightened of the uglywuglies theyre harmless but an idiot might be frightened and give the whole show away im not an idiot said mabel terribly frightened im not afraid of anything mabel said gerald in low thrilling tones for he saw that the time had come to sound another note i know youre brave i believe in you thats why ive arranged it like this im certain youve got the heart of a lion can i trust you mabel felt that to say anything but yes was to throw away a priceless reputation for courage so she said yes then wait here and when you see me with them remember theyre as harmless as snakes i mean doves talk to them just like you would to anyone else see he turned to leave her but stopped at her natural question what hotel did you say you were going to take them to oh said gerald hands i forgot i wanted to ask you are there any rooms or anything in the castle where i could put them for the night the charm will break you know some time and theyll just be coats and things that we can easily carry home any day theres a secret passage mabel began but at the moment the yarddoor opened and an uglywugly put out its head and looked down the street righto gerald ran to meet it mabels hands became cold and damp but she stood saying over and over again theyre not true they cant be true its only a dream and then gerald was there and all the uglywuglies crowding round and gerald saying this is one of our friends mabel the princess in the play you know the ugliwuglies shook her hand and talked very nicely to her then they all walked up the high street as if as gerald said they were anybody else it was a very strange procession but fortunately they met no one mabel decided to show gerald that she was not an idiot so she went on talking with these impossible people finally the procession arrived at the gates of the castle locked of course you see explained gerald as the uglywuglies shook the gates with his hands its so very late there is another way but you have to climb through a hole the ladies the respectable uglywugly began but the ladies with one voice said that they loved adventures so thrilling added the one who wore roses so they went round by the road climbed through the hole and came through all passages and arches to the castle garden the uglywuglies looked at the garden and marble terraces in admiration this seems a very good hotel said the uglywugly in a high hat we will have to go in by the back door said mabel suddenly the front doors locked at halfpast nine they went up the steps of the temple of flora mabel passed behind the statue of the goddess and then geralds lantern showed a very high and very narrow doorway the stone that was the door and that had closed it moved slowly under the touch of mabels fingers this way she said feeling very nervous you lead the way with the lantern said a small ugly wugly to gerald i i must stay behind to close the door said gerald the princess can do that well help her said the lady with flowers you take it insisted gerald giving the lantern to the elderly uglywugly youre the natural leader go straight ahead the respectable uglywugly and the others disappeared into that narrow doorway gerald and mabel almost sobbed with relief but they didnt have time to close the door suddenly the uglywuglies returned and tried to open it again they could see something in the dark passage that alarmed them or they took it into their empty heads that this could not be the back way to any really respectable hotel mabel and gerald never knew but they knew that the uglywuglies were no longer polite and friendly they were angrily shouting threats and trying to open the narrow stone door push push cried gerald i cant any more oh i cant moaned mabel they mustnt get out shouted gerald whats up there cried suddenly a new voice and a new shadow fell on the marble floor of the temple of flora come and help push shouted gerald if they get out theyll kill us all a strong shoulder pushed suddenly between the shoulders of gerald and mabel the heavy narrow door slowly closed and the angry threatening mass of uglywuglies was shut in the stranger looked at them and asked who are you and whats it all about i cant possibly tell you answered gerald come out into the moonlight and lets talk said the man the stranger led both children out from the temple into the bright white moonlight and sat down on the steps a child on each side of him he was cleanshaven and had large eyes that sparkled when the moonlight touched them he looked at the children and said in a friendly way now then go ahead mabel sobbed but gerald said if we told you the truth you wouldnt believe it let me just put the thing from my point of view i come down from london to take care of a big estate on the very first evening i go out for a walk air and approaching a white building hear sounds of a scuffle accompanied by cries for help i do help and shut in someone who behind a stone door now is it unreasonable to ask who it is that ive shut in helped to shut up i mean and who it is that ive helped its reasonable enough agreed gerald well then said the stranger no said gerald i simply cant tell you then i must ask the other side said the man let me go ill open that door and find out for myself tell him said mabel speaking for the first time we cant let them out very well said gerald ill tell him will you promise us that you wont tell anyone what we tell you and that you wont put us in a lunatic asylum if you think that we are mad yes said the stranger i think i can promise that let me begin then said mabel i found a ring and i said it would make me invisible i said it in play and it did i was invisible twentyone hours dont ask where i got the ring now gerald you go on gerald went on he spoke for a long time and so he ended we got them in there and when seven hours are over or fourteen or twentyone or something with a seven in it theyll just be old coats again they came alive at halfpast nine i think theyll stop being it in seven hours thats halfpast four now will you let us go home ill take you home said the stranger in a kindly tone come you dont believe us said gerald of course you dont nobody could come and ill take you home said the man mabel lives at the towers said gerald im housekeepers niece said mabel the stranger took mabel to the castle and went with gerald to the door of the school look here said gerald i know that youre going to open that door possibly said the man well dont or anyway wait till daylight and let us be there we can get there at ten all right ill meet you there at ten answered the stranger good night as the four children went towards the temple of flora they talked as they had talked all the morning about the adventures of last night it was not ten but halfpast twelve because they had to clear up the mess in the diningroom i do hope hell be there mabel said he was such a dear a real gentleman he isnt there though said jimmy i believe you it was just a dream they went up the marble steps in the sunshine and it was difficult to believe that it was the same place where gerald and mabel had been so frightened shall we open the door suggested kathleen and begin to carry home the coats lets listen first said gerald perhaps they arent only coats yet they listened but the passage behind the stone door was quiet as they turned away they saw the man they had come to meet he was on the other side of floras pedestal he lay there on his back his arms flung wide oh look cried cathy and pointed the strangers face was almost green and on his forehead there was a cut and a little blood from it was on the marble floor at the same time mabel pointed too but she did not cry as cathy had done and she pointed at a white painted paper face with very red lips in a moment the face disappeared in the bushes chapter eight it was clear that the stranger had opened the door before the charm broke the uglywuglies were then something more than just coats and hats and sticks so they had hit him on his forehead with some kind of stick jimmy and gerald both knew what was the first thing needed by the unconscious man even before mabel impatiently said water water the two boys turned away and if they go after us asked jimmy what go after us said gerald sharply the uglywuglies jimmy whispered ill do it said gerald he looked to right and left very carefully and chose the way to the lake that did not lead near the bushes he dropped his handkerchief into the water and returned to the temple of flora it was with this that the girls wiped the blood from the mans forehead we need smelling salts said kathleen to mabel hasnt your aunt any yes but dont be a coward said gerald they wont hurt you there was no choice so mabel looked at the bushes and ran towards the castle hes not dead is he asked jimmy anxiously no said kathleen his hearts beating how goodlooking he is suddenly a shadow fell on the marble beside them and a voice said quite a nice young man the children looked up and saw the face of the respectable uglywugly jimmy and kathleen screamed gerald was not frightened because he was wearing the magic ring he looked into the face of the uglywugly and started the face was no longer paper it was a real face and the hands were real hands it was alive what happened asked gerald the others lost their way in the passage last night said the uglywugly they never found the hotel did you asked gerald of course said the uglywugly most respectable exactly as you said then when i came away i found the others all at this door very angry theyd been here all night trying to get out then this gentleman opened the door and that man in the high hat who has bad manners hit him on the head and he fell where you see him the others went away and i myself was just going for help when i saw you jimmy was sobbing and kathleen was white as drawing paper whats the matter my little man said the respectable uglywugly kindly here take the ring whispered gerald and put it on jimmys finger jimmy stopped crying at once and gerald realized what it was that mabel had gone through the night before but it was daylight and gerald was not a coward we must find the others he said you two go and see ill stay with the man in the wood jimmy now fearless as a lion discovered the uglywuglies there was no life in them jimmy shook them to pieces when kathleen and jimmy returned to the temple of flora gerald asked the elderly uglywugly to hide in the bushes with jimmy i think said he the man may be upset when he sees the strangers so the two disappeared behind the bushes mabel came back with the salts just as the stranger opened his eyes with the question whats up now youve hurt your head said gerald the man sat up looked round him and said when did it happen we dont know we found you like it said gerald im all right now said the stranger thank you for the first aid but what an odd thing whats an odd thing asked gerald well i saw you just before i fainted or whatever it was but i had the most extraordinary dream while i was unconscious and you were in it only us asked mabel oh many things impossible things but you were real enough everyone breathed deeply in relief i dreamed there was a door behind floras statue but of course there isnt i dont know how to thank you he added looking at them with what the girls called his beautiful kind eyes you come here when you like you know ill tell you what said gerald as the stranger disappeared in the trees i think i know how we can spend the day lets go home and seal up the ring in an envelope so that itll be powerless to do something horrible then well get out on the roof and have a quiet day books and apples im fed up with adventures the others told him the same thing but first we must get rid of that uglywugly said gerald the uglywuglys real dont make any mistake about that and he became real inside that passage if we could get him back there he might get changed again and then we could take the coats and things back isnt there any other way kathleen asked and mabel said sharply im not going into that passage afraid in broad daylight gerald sneered it isnt broad daylight in there said mabel anyway said gerald well try to get him back and shut the door thats the most we can hope for now weve just got to do it and hes not terrible hes real you see come on he took a hand of each girl and they walked towards the bushes behind which jimmy and the uglywugly had been told to wait when they were near the bushes jimmy came out into the sunlight he was alone where is it asked the girls in one breath walking up and down in a walk said jimmy doing sums in a book he says hes a broker hes very rich hes got a car and a garden with a tenniscourt and a lake and he goes to greece for his holiday sometimes hes building a public library for the people where he lives the children passed the bushes and reached a grass walk surrounded by trees of different kinds hes just round that corner said jimmy hes simply rolling in money he doesnt know what to do with it i wish i was rich id soon show him oh cried gerald there in the green shadows of the trees jimmy got his wish he became rich and the horrible thing was that though they could see what was happening they could not stop it the whole thing was over in a few seconds yet in those few seconds they saw him grow to a young man a middleaged man and then he turned into an elderly gentleman who was looking down at them through spectacles and asking them the nearest way to the railwaystation it was hard to believe that this stout welldressed elderly gentleman with the high hat was their own jimmy oh jimmy dont cried mabel gerald said this is awful and kathleen burst into tears dont cry little girl said thatwhichhadbeen jimmy and you boy cant you give an answer to a question he doesnt know us cried kathleen look here jimmy said gerald are you kidding because if you are its simply my name is mr said thatwhichhadbeenjimmy and gave the name correctly and i dont know you by the way it will perhaps be shorter to call this elderly stout person that short for thatwhichhadbeen jimmy what shall we do whispered mabel in horror and aloud she said oh mr james please give me the ring certainly not said that firmly will you tell me the way to the nearest railway station no said gerald we wont then said that that politely though quite clearly angrily perhaps youll tell me the way to the nearest lunatic asylum oh no cried kathleen youre not mad im not but you are said that if youre not mad youre idiots however i see a gentleman ahead i recognize him and he walked towards the elderly uglywugly two elderly figures raised their hats said a few words to each other and walked side by side down the green walk followed by three unhappy children he wished to be rich so of course he is said gerald hell have money for tickets and everything and when the charm breaks hell find himself somewhere perhaps in a really good hotel and not know how he got there look here you two must collect the coats and things hide them anywhere you like and well carry them home tomorrow i must stick to jimmy go home to mademoiselle and tell her jimmy and i have gone off in the train and will be back to tea and gerald started to run after the uglywugly and that he followed them to the station listened at the ticket office to the voice of that who asked a ticket to london when that and the uglywugly appeared on the platform he bought a third return to london the train arrived and everyone took their seats i dont understand said gerald alone in his thirdclass carriage how railway trains and magic can be at the same time and yet they do mabel and kathleen found six heaps of coats hats skirts gloves golfclubs hockeysticks broomhandles they carried them up the hill to the stone dinosaur and put them in a hole in his stomach then they returned to school just as they were explaining to mademoiselle that the boys had gone to london a figure passed the window it was the stranger who was coming back from the doctors with antiseptic plaster on his cut whos that suddenly asked mademoiselle the girls said that they had met him at yalding towers after that mademoiselle didnt ask them any questions about the boys and later went out for a walk kathleen and mabel stayed at school thinking of gerald and jimmy gerald was standing on the stairs of a london office building on the floor below him was a door with a name mr u w ugli broker and on the floor above was another door on which was the name of geralds little brother now elderly and very rich there were no explaining words under jimmys name when the door opened gerald saw a lot of clerks and mahogany desks it was clear that that had a large business though gerald couldnt guess what what could gerald do it is almost impossible for a boy to enter a large london office and explain that the elderly and respected head of it is not what he seems but is really your little brother who had been made old and rich by a wishing ring he couldnt knock at the door of mr u w ugli and inform his clerks that their chief was just old clothes that had accidentally come alive and then became real there was another difficulty gerald had had no dinner and was very hungry at that moment a boy came up the stairs he had in his hands a dark blue bag full of buns if you get me buns too ill give you half a shilling said gerald all right give the money quickly said the boy payment on delivery said gerald using words which he had never thought to use the boy looked at him in admiration and left when he returned gerald gave the sixpence and took the buns a minute later the boy came out of mr u w uglis office what sort of mans that he asked big pot said the boy very rich know anything about the one on the next floor hes bigger than this one very old firm these two have been rivals for years said the boy look here ill give you five shillings if you help me go ahead said the boy im a private detective said gerald that old man on the floor above hes wanted police asked the boy no relations and i must get him to them somehow now if you could go in and give him a message from someone who wanted to meet him on business ive got a better idea said the boy you go in and see old ugli hed give his ears to have the old boy out of the way for a day ortwo youre right said gerald ill try to do it heres your five shillings he knocked at the door of mr u w ugli it opened and he entered the boy went down a few steps and heard the voice of mr u w ugli he was saying then ill ask him to let me look at the ring and ill drop it you pick it up but remember you dont know me youre sure hes really unwell yes said gerald hes quite mad about that ring hell follow it anywhere i know he will and think of his unhappy relations i do i do said mr ugli kindly thats all i think of of course he went up the stairs to the other office and then that and mr ugli went out to have lunch the two boys followed i say said the boy what are you up to well ill tell you but you wont believe me that old gentlemans not really old at all hes my younger brother who suddenly turned into what you see the others not real at all hes only just old clothes and nothing inside they were turned like that by a magic ring there is no such thing as magic said the boy i learned that at school all right said gerald goodbye oh go ahead said the boy well if i can get that magic ring i shall just wish we were all in a certain place and we shall be and then i will take care of them that and mr ugli entered a very expensive restaurant gerald was going to follow them i say are you really going into this place yes i am you go too ill pay for the lunch the boy was the only person gerald knew in london except thatwhichhadbeenjimmy and the uglywugly and he did not want to talk to them what happened next happened so quickly that as gerald said later it was just like magic the restaurant was crowded gerald ordered two chops then at the next table he heard the words ah yes a curious old family thing that took off the ring and gave it to mr ugli and then the ring slipped from the hand of mr ugli and fell on the floor gerald grasped the ring put it on his finger and cried out aloud in that crowded place i wish jimmy and i were inside that door behind the statue of flora it was the only safe place he could think of gerald never knew what happened in that restaurant there was nothing about it in the papers he never knew what the boy did or thought the lights and the sounds of the restaurant disappeared now there was darkness and silence around them and through the darkness came a voice and it was not the voice of that elderly man who had been jimmy but the voice of jimmy who was geralds little brother the voice said jerry jerry ive had such an odd dream its all right jimmy he said its not a dream now its that ring again i had to wish us here to get you back out of your dream wish us where asked jimmy inside the passage behind the flora statue said gerald but how are we going to get out asked jimmy oh i know it isnt true its a dream yes said gerald bravely its just a dream jimmy well just call out now and then but its really only a dream of course chapter nine when people are surrounded by magic almost anything may happen so it is not surprising that mabel and kathleen felt a strange unreasonable but quite strong wish to return to the temple of flora and this explains how it was that when gerald and jimmy holding hands in the darkness of the passage called for help for the first time and that call was at once answered from outside mabel and kathleen opened the stone door and the boys came out of the passage into the temple of flora then gerald and jimmy answered the questions of their sister and mabel and you left that uglywugly in london said mabel though you could take him with you its all right where it is said gerald i couldnt think of everything and besides no thank you look here said mabel lets just put the ring back in the treasureroom its time to have done with it so they went up to the castle and the ring was put back among the odd ornaments that mabel had once said were magic it doesnt look magic at all said gerald its just like an old silly ring i wonder if what mabel said about the other things is true lets try id like to try said mabel only i dont remember what i said anything was so had the others perhaps that was why when they invented qualities for various rings and chains and brooches nothing at all happened its only the ring thats magic said mabel at last oh i say she added in quite a different voice what i think the ring is not magic but we know it is what ring the wishingring said kathleen the invisibility ring dont you see said mabel opening her dark eyes very wide the ring is what you say it is thats how it made us invisible i just said it oh we cant leave it here it is too valuable say what it is its a wishingring said jimmy weve had that before and you had your silly wish said mabel more and more excited i say it isnt a wishingring i say its a ring that makes the person who wears it four yards high she put the ring on her finger and at the same moment she became indeed four yards high now youve done it said gerald and he was right oh mabel it was silly of you said kathleen you didnt believe me when i said it was what i said it was said mabel and i had to show it to you what shall i do now i should like to know we must conceal you till you get normal said gerald practically yes but where said mabel im afraid one of you will have to stay the night with me im not going to be left alone the silly height i am height was the right word mabel had said four yards high and she was four yards high but she was as thin as when her height was normal so she looked as gerald said like a nice worm her clothes had of course grown with her she sat down suddenly on the floor its no use sitting there said gerald im not sitting here said mabel i only got down so as to be able to get through the door i think ill have to go on my hands and knees through most places look here i must be out of doors before it gets dark you cant someone will see you no i can creep on my front like a snake and hide in the bushes near the dinosaur said mabel and we could have a picnic there ill write to auntie shell give you the things for a picnic so she wrote on a page from geralds notebook dearest auntie please may we have some things for a picnic gerald will bring them i cant come myself because i am a little tired i think i have been growing rather fast your loving niece mabel ps lot of things please because some of us are very hungry it was difficult but possible for mabel to creep through the bushes when gerald returned with a basket her long pale face could be seen among the leaves very near the ground i look just like anybody else like this dont i she asked anxiously all the rest of me is miles away under different bushes weve covered up the parts between the bushes with branches and leaves said kathleen dont move mabel or youll shake them off jimmy was unpacking the basket he found there many good things bread and butter a bottle of milk a bottle of water cake and apples it was a wonderful picnic everyone became happy and calm a nice afterfood peace filled the summer air even the stone dinosaur seemed peaceful and happy i think he liked a good meal in his day said gerald who did the dinosaur said gerald he had a meal today said kathleen and giggled yes said mabel giggling also what do you mean a meal jimmy asked suspiciously oh dont be stupid said kathleen we fed the dinosaur through the hole in his stomach with the clothes the ugly wuglies were made of we can take them home with us then said gerald so thats all right look here said kathleen suddenly ive got an idea let me have the ring ill give it back before we go oh but you arent going yet said mabel she pulled off the ring kathleen took the ring and started to run towards the dinosaur crying lets go and take the things now her idea was quite simple she knew that a person who is not enchanted by the ring could rename it and change its powers she wanted to say aloud so that the others could not hear her this is a wishingring it gives you any wish you choose and she did say it and no one heard her except the birds the way was uphill it was sunny and kathleen had run fast so when her brothers caught her at the dinosaur she was very hot indeed and couldnt decide calmly what to wish ill get up and move the things down because i know where i put them she said gerald and jimmy helped her to climb up and she disappeared through the hole into the dark inside of the monster then she began to throw down clothes and sticks im coming up to help you said gerald just as he got his shoulders through the opening he heard kathleens boots on the floor of the dinosaurs inside and kathleens voice its so cool in here statues are always cool i wish to be a statue oh the oh was a cry of horror whats up gerald asked but in his heart he knew he climbed up inside in the little light that came up through the hole he could see something white he struck a match and saw the face of kathleen white stony and lifeless her hair was white too and her hands clothes shoes everything was white hard and cold kathleen had her wish she was a marble statue gerald could not speak it was too sudden too terrible then he turned and spoke down out of that cold stony silence to jimmy in the green sunny live world outside jimmy he said kathleens gone and said that ring was a wishingring and so it was of course i see now what she was up to running like that and then she went and wished she was a statue and she is asked jimmy below come up and have a look said gerald and jimmy came she is really a statue he said in horror come on lets go and tell mabel said gerald the two boys returned and told her the news oh how awful what next said mabel shell come all right said gerald trying to be calm yes but what about me asked mabel i havent got the ring and my time will be up before hers is could you get it off her hand ill put it back on her hand when i am normal again im afraid the rings turned to stone like her boots and all her clothes but ill go and see gerald got inside the dinosaur struck a match and saw the dark ring on the white hand of the marble kathleen he pulled the ring and to his surprise it slipped easily off the cold marble finger i say cathy i am sorry he said then he thought that perhaps she could hear him so he told the statue exactly what he and the others wanted to do then he returned to the others heres your ring he said to mabel now youre not frightened of anything are you no said mabel in surprise ill stay here but you must leave me all the coats because it will be cold in the night then i shall be here when kathleen comes out of the stone again and you two go home and tell mademoiselle that kathleens staying at the towers but we dont know which of you will come right first anyhow well say good night to mademoiselle and come and have a look at you before we go to bed said gerald mabel crept under the dinosaur the boys covered her with coats and left the sun had disappeared behind the black trees and the moon was rising mabel slept peacefully under the dinosaur inside the monster kathleen alive in her marble slept too she had heard geralds words she was the same kathleen only she was kathleen in a case of marble that didnt let her move inside the marble was not cold or hard but warm and pleasantly safe everything was well she had only to wait quietly and quite comfortably when she would come out of this stone case so she waited calmly and then fell asleep when she woke she felt needles in feet and her arms were tired she rubbed her eyes and remembered she had been a statue a statue inside the stone dinosaur now im alive again she said and ill get out of it she sat down put her feet through the hole and realized that the dinosaur was moving oh said kathleen inside it it is moonlight and its come alive like gerald said it was indeed moving kathleen was afraid to jump out of it because the beast was moving fast they were going downhill then kathleen heard a splash they were close to water the lake kathleen dropped quickly out of the hole on the grass ran sideways and stood panting in the shadow of a statues pedestal a moment later the dinosaur slipped heavily into the water and swam towards the central island be careful little lady i jump the voice came from the pedestal and next moment phoebus had jumped from the pedestal you are new said phoebus i havent seen you before i am quite new said kathleen and i didnt know you could talk why not phoebus laughed you can talk but im alive am i not he asked the white water calls me i go and he jumped into the water kathleen turned and went up the hill towards the bushes she must find mabel and they must go home at once she found mabel very quickly because her long and wormlike form covered with coats and trousers could be easily seen in the moonlight kathleen touched her long cheek gently and she woke whats up she said sleepily its only me kathleen explained how cold your hands are said mabel wake up said kathleen and lets talk cant we go home now im awfully tired and hungry youre too long to go home yet said kathleen sadly and then mabel remembered she lay with closed eyes then she suddenly cried out oh cathy i feel so funny im getting shorter i know lam mabel was really getting shorter her feet were near her long arms became shorter her face was no longer half a yard long you are all right oh i am so glad cried kathleen and now well go home at once dear go home said mabel slowly sitting up and looking at kathleen with her big dark eyes go home like that like what kathleen asked impatiently why you was mabels odd answer im all right said kathleen come on look at yourself your hands your dress everything kathleen looked at her hands they were of marble whiteness her dress too her shoes her stockings even the ends of her hair she was white as snow what is it she asked worried dont you see youve not come right youre a statue still im not im alive im talking to you i know you are darling said mabel kindly thats because its moonlight but you can see im alive of course i can ive got the ring said mabel taking her marble hand its moonlight and youre a statue and youve just come alive with all the other statues and when the moon goes down youll just be a statue again by the way wheres the dinosaur in his bath said kathleen and so are all the other stone beasts well said mabel trying to look on the bright side of things thats good news chapter ten ive got an idea said mabel we may find out a lot about this magic place if the other statues arent too proud to talk to us they arent said kathleen at least phoebus wasnt he was very polite and nice where is he mabel asked he was in the lake said kathleen then lets go down there said mabel she jumped up but the white kathleen did not move hello little sister said a voice behind them they turned their heads surprised there in the moonlight stood phoebus smiling at them very friendly oh its you said kathleen yes said phoebus cheerfully who is your friend child this is mabel said kathleen mabel got up and bowed hesitated and held out a hand im happy to meet you little lady said phoebus taking her marble fingers but i dont understand how you can see us and why you do not fear mabel showed him the ring i see said phoebus but if you have that why not become a statue and swim with us in the lake i cant swim said mabel nor yet me said kathleen you can said phoebus all statues that come to life are good at all sports and you little lady wish yourself a statue and join us you see said mabel this ring you wish for things and you never know how long theyre going to last it would be jolly to be a statue now but not next morning you dont know the powers of your ring said phoebus wish exactly and the ring will exactly perform say this i wish to be a statue of living marble till the dawn oh yes do mabel it would be so jolly cried kathleen and could i swim then swim and laugh and eat the food of the gods and listen to a beautiful song o mabel do said kathleen i am so hungry still mabel hesitated then she looked at kathleens legs and suddenly said very well i will but first ill take off my shoes and stockings marble boots look simply awful she had pulled off shoes and stockings then she said the wish and there were two little live statues in the moonlight tall phoebus took a hand of each come run he cried and they ran they ran down the slope to the lake and jumped into the water they swam easily and beautifully and it was so lovely there the moon was high in the sky the willows waterlilies temples terraces and bushes made the place very romantic now one more round said phoebus kindly and then well swim to the island the island was bigger than it seemed and it was covered with trees and bushes but when they passed the trees they saw a wide lawn and then marble steps going down to a round pool where there were no waterlilies only gold and silver fish and the water and marble and grass was lighted with a clear white light seven times stronger than the whitest moonlight and in the waters of the pool seven moons reflected the girls looked up at the sky almost expecting to see seven moons there but no the old moon was alone there there are seven moons said mabel of course said phoebus everything in our world is seventies as much so as in yours now lets join the ladies on the other side of the pool there were twenty or thirty figures all statues and all alive some were dipping their white feet among the gold and silver fish others were holding hands and dancing in a ring i bring two guests said phoebus coming up to the group the statues crowded round stroking the girls hair are the wreaths ready hebe the tallest lady asked make two more and almost directly hebe came down the steps with rose wreaths on her arms there was one for each marble head the children remembered how mademoiselle had said that gods and goddesses always wore wreaths for meals hebe herself put the roses on the girls heads and aphrodite took them by the hands and said come we must get the feast ready eros psyche hebe all you young people can get the fruit i dont see any fruit said kathleen you must pick it like this said psyche lifting her marble arms to a willow branch she showed her hand to the children it held a pear i see said mabel you just she touched the willow branch and they saw a big peach in her hand yes just that laughed psyche who was a dear as anyone could see after this they gathered fruit into a few silver baskets while the elder statues were busy getting golden glasses and jugs and dishes from the branches of other trees and filling them with everything nice to eat and drink then everyone sat or lay down on the steps and the feast began i wonder what the boys are doing said mabel taking the third peach at this moment said hermes who had just returned from the flight at this moment they are trying to find you near the home of the dinosaur theyre very worried about you kathleen stood up thank you all very much she said it was very kind of you to have us and weve enjoyed ourselves very much but i think its time to go now if you are worried about your brothers said phoebus they can easily join you give me your ring for a moment he took it from kathleens halfreluctant hand dipped it in the reflection of one of the seven moons and gave it back now he said say what mabel wished for herself say i know and kathleen made her wish you were too quick said phoebus they are statues now but they are not here hermes bring them here and explain things as you come he dipped the ring again in one of the reflected moons and gave it back to kathleen now its clean and ready for the next magic it was clear that hermes had explained everything quite fully because when marble gerald and jimmy arrived they were quite at ease they bowed to the goddesses and took their places beside them when the feast was over hera turned her eyes on the children and said how did the ring come into your hands ill tell you said mabel once upon a time there was a little girl called mabel she added and went on with story of the enchanted castle the marble gods listened almost as enchanted as the castle itself and so ended mabel ended kathleen wished for the boys and the lord hermes brought them and here we all are the statues began discussing the story when the discussion was over mabel said now we want to know something what how you come alive and how you know about the ring tell them phoebus said aphrodite so phoebus told all statues he said can come alive when the moon shines but only on one night in all the year people can see them and when is that gerald asked politely at the festival of the harvest said phoebes and it can happen only in certain temples one of these temples is in this great garden then said gerald much interested if we come up to that temple on that night we could see you even if we are not statues or dont have the ring even so said phoebus more we must answer any question asked by people and the night is when ah said phoebus and laughed wouldnt you like to know then the great marble zeus stroked his long beard and said enough of stories phoebus play to us but the ring said mabel in a whisper how you know all about the ring ask me again before dawn and i will tell you all i know of it the god whispered back then phoebus began to play the lyre and music filled the air it was so sweet and beautiful that those who listened forgot time and space and then suddenly the music stopped phoebus stood up crying the dawn to your pedestals o gods at once the whole crowd of beautiful marble people ran towards the trees then the children heard the splash they heard too the breathing of a great beast and knew that the dinosaur too was returning to his own place only hermes had time to whisper to them with a laugh in fourteen days from now at the temple of strange stones whats the secret of the ring asked mabel the ring is the heart of the magic said hermes ask at the moonrise on the fourteenth day and you shall know all and as he flew away a cold wind began to blow a grey light grew and grew and the marble slipped away from the children like a skin and they were statues no more but live children standing in long grass there was no lawn no marble steps no pool with seven moons what shall we do now said mabel shivering with cold we cant swim now and this is the island it was and they couldnt swim is there a boat jimmy asked no said mabel not on this side of the lake cant anyone think of anything gerald asked the ring said mabel of course we can get home with the help of the ring where is the ring asked gerald you had it mabel said to kathleen i know i had said kathleen but i gave it to psyche to look at and and she put it on her finger everyone tried not to be angry with kathleen if we ever get off this island can you find psyches statue and get it off again asked gerald no i cant mabel moaned i dont know where the statue is ive never seen it now look here said gerald after a long silence lets make a tour of the island perhaps we could find a boat quite sure that there wasnt and couldnt be any boat the four children started to explore the island the sun was already sending strong light straight at the childrens eyes this with the fact that he was not looking where he was going was the reason why gerald stumbled fell down some steps that opened suddenly in the ground oh gerald called mabel down the steps are you hurt no said gerald angrily because he was hurt its steps and theres a passage i knew there was a passage said mabel it goes under the water and comes out at the temple of flora then we can get out that way said geralds voice i think it goes past the place where the uglywugly found its good hotel its no good said jimmy weakly you know well you cant get out of that temple of flora door even if you get to it i dont know said gerald there can be a secret spring inside that door so the four went down the stone steps that led to the underground and underwater passage then the passage took a turn there were more steps down down and then the children saw something that they had never thought possible it was a great marble hall its roof was held up by two rows of round pillars and every corner of the hall was filled with a warm lovely light how beautiful kathleen whispered i cant believe its real said mabel this hall in which the children found themselves was the most beautiful place in the world all round it were great arches and through these arches they could see many things through one arch they saw an olive garden and in it two lovers who held each others hands under an italian moon through another a small ship on a wild sea a third showed a king on his throne a fourth showed a really good hotel with the respectable uglywugly sitting on the front doorsteps there was a mother bending over a childs bed there was an artist looking at the picture he had painted a general dying on a field of a battle he had won and these things were not pictures but true life there were many other pictures and all showed the best moments in peoples lives and the really good hotel had its place here too because there are some souls that ask nothing more than a really good hotel they went slowly up the hall and at the end of it the children saw where the light came from it came from one statue that mabel did not know where to find the statue of psyche they went on slowly quite happy and when they came close to psyche they saw the ring on her hand gerald put his knee on the pedestal i hope you dont mind he said and drew the ring off very gently then they passed behind the white psyche and came to a dark passage that led from the hall kathleen said give me the ring i know exactly what to say gerald gave it reluctantly i wish said kathleen slowly that we were safe in our own beds undressed and in our nightgowns and asleep and the next moment they were all in their own beds mabels own bed was of course at yalding towers and to this day mabels aunt cannot understand how mabel who was staying the night in the town was in her bed in the morning chapter eleven it was showday at yalding castle and the children decided to go and visit mabel there were more visitors than usual today because many people knew that lord yalding who was in the castle wanted to show the place in all its fantastic beauty to a rich american who wished to rent it it certainly looked very splendid mabels aunt had taken the covers off the furniture and put flowers in the rooms all the afternoon the crowd in its smart holiday clothes pink blouses and lightcolored suits and summer hats passed through and through the dark hall the magnificent drawingrooms and bedrooms and picturegalleries the sounds of boots and highheeled shoes laughter and loud voices could be heard everywhere i hate to see all these people in our garden said gerald as the children watched the visitors from the window of the stone summerhouse at the end of the terrace i said that to that nice man this morning said mabel and he said it wasnt much to let them come once a week did he say anything else asked jimmy a lot of things said mabel i told him about our adventures oh no and he thinks ive got a real literary talent i say i forgot to tell you but i met mademoiselle and shes coming to meet us and walk back with us said gerald it may be kind but now we shall have to sit here and wait for her said mabel and i promised wed meet that man hes going to bring things in a basket and have a picnictea with us where beside the dinosaur when as soon as the gates shut thats five we might take mademoiselle to the picnic suggested gerald you cant tell what she will think about it said kathleen well ill tell you what said gerald lazily turning on the stone bench you all go there and meet your man a picnics a picnic and ill wait for mademoiselle mabel said that this was jolly decent of gerald jimmy added that gerald liked to suck up to people little boys dont understand diplomacy said gerald calmly you never know when a grownup may be useful besides they like it you must give them some little pleasures all right said mabel come on cathy jimmy it was a sunny summer day when the children reached the dinosaur they were very hot the man looked very nice the girls thought he was wearing a grey summer suit a pretty green tie and a straw hat he welcomed the children warmly and there were two promising baskets under the trees he was a man of tact you must be thirsty and hungry he said well have tea but first you can take off your shoes and stockings theres a little canal right there it was very pleasant to dip feet in cool water after a hot walk when they came back they had tea with milk and cakes and fruit jimmy was much impressed with it and he suddenly said your feasts as good as the feast of the gods almost what do you mean asked the host and jimmy told him the whole story of that wonderful night when the statues came alive and they had a feast with them the man smiled did you get all this out of a book no said jimmy it happened everything ive told you did happen and so did the things mabel told you the man looked a little uncomfortable all right he said and there was a short silence look here said jimmy do you believe me or not dont be silly jimmy kathleen whispered i think you tell adventures very well said the man calmly very well said jimmy sitting up you dont believe me cathy give me the ring oh no said the girls together they did not want to give the ring to jimmy but they couldnt stop him it was his hour now said jimmy this is the ring mabel told you about i say it is a wishingring and if you put it on your finger and wish everything you wish will happen dont wish for anything silly said kathleen wish for something you really want ill wish for the only thing i really want said the man i wish my friend were here the three who knew the power of the ring looked round to see the mans friend but they only saw mademoiselle and gerald mademoiselle was wearing a white dress looking quite nice and like a picture and gerald was hot and polite good afternoon said gerald i persuaded mademoiselle that sentence was never finished because the man and the french teacher were looking at each other like stuck pigs as jimmy said later is she your friend jimmy asked oh yes said the man you are my friend are you not but yes mademoiselle said kindly i am your friend there you see said jimmy the ring does do what i said you can say its the ring for me its the happiest coincidence said the man jimmy give your brother some tea mademoiselle come and walk in the woods i would like to talk to you yes we must speak to each other said mademoiselle i havent seen lord yalding for a long time so he was lord yalding all the time said jimmy as the white dress and the grey suit disappeared in the wood and she is his friend his friend said mabel with strong scorn dont you see shes his lover shes the lady that had gone into a convent and he couldnt find her and now the rings made them happy mabel was right about mademoiselle her guardian was against her marriage to a poor lord and had put her in a convent then he disappeared in south america with all her money and mademoiselle had to work she became a teacher and came to that school because it was near lord yaldings home next morning mademoiselle looked a different person her cheeks were pink her lips were red and her eyes were larger and brighter immediately after breakfast lord yalding invited the whole party to yalding towers the children decided to explore the castle lord yalding gave his permission and together with mademoiselle he went out for a walk in the garden mabel showed the others all the secret doors and passages and stairs that she had discovered when they were coming out of a little secret room they suddenly met an odd little man who had a beard like a goat this part of the castle is private said mabel and shut the door behind her i know that said the stranger but i have the permission of the lord yalding to see the house oh said mabel im sorry we didnt know the gentleman was thin and welldressed he had small quick eyes and a brown face you are playing some game no sir said gerald only exploring may i join your expedition asked the gentleman smiling the children looked at each other we cant take you because we dont know what you want to find here said jimmy i understand your position said the gentleman i have come to this country because i want to rent a nice house my name is jefferson d conway oh said mabel then youre the american millionaire not yet young lady said mr jefferson d conway now lets start our tour mabel led the millionaire through the castle he seemed pleased but at the same time disappointed too it is a fine castle he said at last when they returned to the state bedroom but isnt there a secret passage or a ghost there are said mabel if you were sleep in this room i expectyoull see the ghost said mabel there is a ghost here then he said with enthusiasm yes mabel answered old sir rupert who lost his head long ago walks at night here with his head under his arm well said the american with a smile ill ask the lord yalding to let me pass a night in his state bedroom and if i hear a ghosts footsteps ill take the place i am glad said kathleen you are very certain of your ghost said the american suspiciously let me tell you young gentlemen that i carry a gun and when i see a ghost i shoot and he pulled a pistol out of his pocket thank you for all your kindness if the american rents the castle hell pay lord yalding a good rent and then he could marry the french teacher said mabel we must make a ghost for him later that evening lord yalding suddenly appeared at school again and said mr jefferson conway wants you boys to spend the night with him in the state chamber you dont mind do you he thinks youve got some idea of playing ghosttricks on him it was impossible to refuse though the boys were reluctant to see sir ruperts ghost as soon as mabel learned from her aunt that mr jefferson d conway would sleep at the castle that night she found lord yalding and got the ring back then she said a wish that sir rupert and his head may appear tonight in the state bedroom gerald and jimmy were awakened by a pistol shot in the dark state bedroom lighted by six tall candles they saw the american with a pistol in his hand and at the door a figure and no head the head sure enough was there but it was under the right arm the face looking from under the arm was pleasantly smiling both boys screamed the american shot again the bullet passed through sir rupert who didnt notice it then suddenly it was morning the american was gone perhaps youll believe in the ring now said jimmy to lord yalding whom he met later on in the picturegallery its all our doing that mr jefferson saw the ghost he told us hed take the house if he saw a ghost so of course he did see one oh you did did you said lord yalding in rather an odd voice perhaps youll be interested to learn mr jefferson d conway was so pleased with your ghost that he got me out of bed at six oclock this morning to talk about it oh said jimmy what did he say he said as far as i can remember said lord yalding in the same strange voice he said my lord i like your castle and the park but i dont like your ancestors they walk at night with their heads under their arms i dont mind a ghost that sighs but a ghost that stands with its head under his arm smiling when bullets go through it no if this is a british family ghost excuse me and he went off by the early train i am sorry said jimmy remarked we thought it would be just what you wanted and perhaps someone else will take the house i dont know anyone else rich enough said lord yalding i say jimmy looked up at lord yalding with a new idea if you need money why dont you sell your jewels i havent any jewels said lord yalding and began to walk away i mean the ones in the paneled room with the stars in the ceiling jimmy insisted following him there arent any said lord yalding shortly and i dont want to hear any of this nonsense its not nonsense said mabel appearing together with mademoiselle you just come and see let us see what they want to show us said mademoiselle so they went mabel and jimmy leading while mademoiselle and lord yalding followed hand in hand chapter twelve the procession entered the little paneled room theres a secret spring here somewhere said mabel trying to find it where said lord yalding here said mabel impatiently only i cant find it and she couldnt mabels careful fingers felt the whole paneling the spring was simply not there you see said lord yalding severely ive had enough of this silly business give me the ring its mine as you found it somewhere here and dont say another word about all this rubbish of magic and enchantment geralds got the ring said mabel miserably then go and find him said lord yalding both of you soon the four children came back together they dont believe about the jewels said mabel suddenly in tears and i cant find the spring it was here and her fingers felt it as she spoke and as she stopped speaking the panels opened and everyone saw the shelves full of jewels my god said lord yalding and mademoiselle but why now asked mabel why not before i think its magic said gerald theres no real spring here and it couldnt act because the ring wasnt here phoebus told us the ring was the heart of all the magic gerald gave the ring to lord yalding soon the children and mademoiselle returned to school in the evening and at breakfast mademoiselle was happy and kind then lord yalding came to see her the meeting took place in the drawingroom soon lord yalding went out of the drawingroom leaving the door open and gerald going up to his room for a pencil heard the sobs mademoiselle was quite certainly crying theyre beginning to quarrel already he said to himself he went into the drawingroom shutting the door behind him it is all over mademoiselle was saying he will not marry me gerald was certain that the matter was somehow the fault of that ring and in this gerald was right as you remember gerald had very pretty ways with grownups when he wanted so he persuaded her to tell him what had happened the story as told by mademoiselle was certainly an unusual one lord yalding last night after dinner had walked in the park i know said gerald and he had the ring on and he saw he saw the monuments become alive sobbed mademoiselle he remembered your story and wished himself a statue then he swam in the lake and had a feast with gods on an island at dawn he became a real man again he says that its not a dream he thinks that hes mad and a mad man must not marry there is no hope there said gerald hes not mad and its not a dream its magic did he talk to the gods this is the most mad of all his ideas he says that the gods asked him to come to some temple tomorrow when the moon rises right cried gerald dear nice kind pretty mademoiselle stop crying tomorrow he will go to that temple we will go hell see that he isnt mad and youll understand all about everything mademoiselle half sobbed half smiled and said is it some of your tricks like the ghost i cant explain said gerald but everything is going to be exactly what you wish i believe you said mademoiselle and now it is near moonrise the french teacher and the four children are going over the grass they go across the lawn and through the wood and come at last to a ring of big stones it is the temple of strange stones in the middle of the circle there is a great flat stone something dark moves in the circle mademoiselle goes to it and takes its arm it is lord yalding and he is telling her to go never she cries if you are mad i am mad too because i believe the story these children tell and i am here to be with you the children holding hands near the flat stone listen trying not to listen are you not afraid lord yalding is saying gerald goes to them to say you cant be afraid if you are wearing the ring and im sorry but we can hear every word you say she laughs again it doesnt matter she says you already know that we love each other then lord yalding puts the ring on her finger and they stand together then the first moonbeam touches the far end of the central stone now it gets nearer and nearer to the middle of it now at last it touches the very heart and centre of that great stone and a fountain of light comes out of it everything changes there are no more secrets there is no time or space it is a moment and it is eternity at that moment six people saw many moving shapes the great beasts came first strange forms that were when the world was new gigantic dinosaurs mammoths strange birds then not from the garden but from very far away came the stone gods of egypt with the heads of animals and birds all in stone and all alive figures of angels with wings sphinxes idols from southern islands and last of all the beautiful marble shapes of the gods and goddesses whom they had seen on the lakeisland the children had thought to ask many questions but now no one spoke a word because they were in the circle of the real magic where all things are understood without speech all the stone creatures gathered round the stone then all the faces turned upward and cried one word the light and the sound of their voice was like the sound of a great wave and then the light disappeared and with it disappeared all the stone figures i want to go to the cave on the island said the french girl very quietly they went down to the boathouse crossed the lake in a boat and came to the island then they found the steps they went down into the hall of psyche it was the hall of granted wishes the ring said lord yalding the ring said his lover is the magic ring given long ago to people and it is what you say it is a lady of my house gave it to your ancestor and asked him to build her a garden and a house like her own palace and garden in her own land this place is built partly by his love and partly by that magic she never lived to see it that was the price of the magic only one wish is left now her voice went on shall i wish yes wish they said all of them i wish then said lord yaldings lover that all the magic this ring has done may be undone and that the ring itself may be just a symbol of our love as soon as she said these words the enchanted light and the windows of granted wishes disappeared and where psyches statue had been was a stone it is her grave the girl said next day no one could remember anything at all exactly but many things were changed when mademoiselle woke in her own bed in the morning she had in her hand not the magic ring but the plain gold ring later it was used in the wedding ceremony more than half the jewels in the paneled room were gone and those that remained lay just on the shelves there was no passage at the back of the temple of flora quite a lot of the secret passages and hidden rooms had disappeared and there were fewer statues in the garden however the jewels that were left were quite enough to pay for everything all the ringmagic was undone so suddenly that it was difficult to believe that any magic had ever happened but how then could you explain the paragraph which appeared in the evening papers the day after the magic of the moonrising mysterious disappearance of a well known businessman mr u w ugli the papers said had remained late working at his office when in the morning the office door was opened the police found the clothes of this gentleman on the floor together with an umbrella a walking stick and a golf club his body was not found the end
