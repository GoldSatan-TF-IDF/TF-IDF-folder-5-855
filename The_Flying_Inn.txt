the sea was a pale elfin green and the afternoon had already felt the fairy touch of evening as a young woman with dark hair dressed in a crinkly coppercoloured sort of dress of the artistic order was walking rather listlessly along the parade of pebblewickonsea trailing a parasol and looking out upon the seas horizon she had a reason for looking instinctively out at the sealine a reason that many young women have had in the history of the world but there was no sail in sight on the beach below the parade were a succession of small crowds surrounding the usual orators of the seaside whether niggers or socialists whether clowns or clergymen here would stand a man doing something or other with paper boxes and the holiday makers would watch him for hours in the hope of some time knowing what it was that he was doing with them next to him would be a man in a top hat with a very big bible and a very small wife who stood silently beside him while he fought with his clenched fist against the heresy of milnian sublapsarianism so widespread in fashionable wateringplaces it was not easy to follow him he was so very much excited but every now and then the words our sublapsarian friends would recur with a kind of wailing sneer next was a young man talking of nobody knew what least of all himself but apparently relying for public favour mainly on having a ring of carrots round his hat he had more money lying in front of him than the others next were niggers next was a childrens service conducted by a man with a long neck who beat time with a little wooden spade farther along there was an atheist in a towering rage who pointed every now and then at the childrens service and spoke of natures fairest things being corrupted with the secrets of the spanish inquisition by the man with the little spade of course the atheist who wore a red rosette was very withering to his own audience as well hypocrites he would say and then they would throw him money dupes and dastards and then they would throw him more money but between the atheist and the childrens service was a little owlish man in a red fez weakly waving a green gamp umbrella his face was brown and wrinkled like a walnut his nose was of the sort we associate with judaea his beard was the sort of black wedge we associate rather with persia the young woman had never seen him before he was a new exhibit in the now familiar museum of cranks and quacks the young woman was one of those people in whom a real sense of humour is always at issue with a certain temperamental tendency to boredom or melancholia and she lingered a moment and leaned on the rail to listen it was fully four minutes before she could understand a word the man was saying he spoke english with so extraordinary an accent that she supposed at first that he was talking in his own oriental tongue all the noises of that articulation were odd the most marked was an extreme prolongation of the short u into oo as in poooot for put gradually the girl got used to the dialect and began to understand the words though some time elapsed even then before she could form any conjecture of their subject matter eventually it appeared to her that he had some fad about english civilisation having been founded by the turks or perhaps by the saracens after their victory in the crusades he also seemed to think that englishmen would soon return to this way of thinking and seemed to be urging the spread of teetotalism as an evidence of it the girl was the only person listening to him looook he said wagging a curled brown finger looook at your own inns which he pronounced as ince your inns of which you write in your booooks those inns were not poooot up in the beginning to sell ze alcoholic christian drink they were put up to sell ze nonalcoholic islamic drinks you can see this in the names of your inns they are eastern names asiatic names you have a famous public house to which your omnibuses go on the pilgrimage it is called the elephant and castle that is not an english name it is an asiatic name you will say there are castles in england and i will agree with you there is the windsor castle but where he cried sternly shaking his green umbrella at the girl in an angry oratorical triumph where is the windsor elephant i have searched all windsor park no elephants the girl with the dark hair smiled and began to think that this man was better than any of the others in accordance with the strange system of concurrent religious endowment which prevails at wateringplaces she dropped a two shilling piece into the round copper tray beside him with honourable and disinterested eagerness the old gentleman in the red fez took no notice of this but went on warmly if obscurely with his argument then you have a place of drink in this town which you call the bool we generally call it the bull said the interested young lady with a very melodious voice you have a place of drink which you call the bool he reiterated in a sort of abstract fury and surely you see that this is all vary ridiculous no no said the girl softly and in deprecation why should there be a bull he cried prolonging the word in his own way why should there be a bull in connection with a festive locality who thinks about a bull in gardens of delight what need is there of a bull when we watch the tuliptinted maidens dance or pour the sparkling sherbert you yourselves my friends and he looked around radiantly as if addressing an enormous mob you yourselves have a proverb it is not calculated to promote prosperity to have a bull in a china shop equally my friends it would not be calculated to promote prosperity to have a bull in a wine shop all this is clear he stuck his umbrella upright in the sand and struck one finger against another like a man getting to business at last it iss as clear as the sun at noon he said solemnly it iss as clear as the sun at noon that this word bull which is devoid of restful and pleasurable associations is but the corruption of another word which possesses restful and pleasurable associations the word is not bull it is the bulbul his voice rose suddenly like a trumpet and he spread abroad his hands like the fans of a tropic palmtree after this great effect he was a little more subdued and leaned gravely on his umbrella you will find the same trace of asiatic nomenclature in the names of all your english inns he went on nay you will find it i am almost certain in all your terms in any way connected with your revelries and your reposes why my good friends the very name of that insidious spirit by which you make strong your drinks is an arabic word alcohol it is obvious is it not that this is the arabic article al as in alhambra as in algebra and we need not pause here to pursue its many appearances in connection with your festive institutions as in your alsops beer your ally sloper and your partly joyous institution of the albert memorial above all in your greatest feasting day your christmas day which you so erroneously suppose to be connected with your religion what do you say then do you say the names of the christian nations do you say i will have a little france i will have a little ireland i will have a little scotland i will have a little spain no o and the noise of the negative seemed to waggle as does the bleating of a sheep you say i will have a little turkey which is your name for the country of the servant of the prophet and once more he stretched out his arms sublimely to the east and west and appealed to earth and heaven the young lady looking at the seagreen horizon with a smile clapped her grey gloved hands softly together as if at a peroration but the little old man with the fez was far from exhausted yet in reply to this you will object he began o no no breathed the young lady in a sort of dreamy rapture i dont object i dont object the littlest bit in reply to this you will object proceeded her preceptor that some inns are actually named after the symbols of your national superstitions you will hasten to point out to me that the golden cross is situated opposite charing cross and you will expatiate at length on kings cross gerrards cross and the many crosses that are to be found in or near london but you must not forget and here he wagged his green umbrella roguishly at the girl as if he was going to poke her with it none of you my friends must forget what a large number of crescents there are in london denmark crescent mornington crescent st marks crescent st georges crescent grosvenor crescent regents park crescent nay royal crescent and why should we forget pelham crescent why indeed everywhere i say homage paid to the holy symbol of the religion of the prophet compare with this network and pattern of crescents this city almost consisting of crescents the meagre array of crosses which remain to attest the ephemeral superstition to which you were for one weak moment inclined the crowds on the beach were rapidly thinning as teatime drew nearer the west grew clearer and clearer with the evening till the sunshine seemed to have got behind the pale green sea and be shining through as through a wall of thin green glass the very transparency of sky and sea might have to this girl for whom the sea was the romance and the tragedy the hint of a sort of radiant hopelessness the flood made of a million emeralds was ebbing as slowly as the sun was sinking but the river of human nonsense flowed on for ever i will not for one moment maintain said the old gentleman that there are no difficulties in my case or that all the examples are as obviously true as those that i have just demonstrated noo it is obvious let us say that the saracens head is a corruption of the historic truth the saracen is ahead i am far from saying it is equally obvious that the green dragon was originally the agreeing dragoman though i hope to prove in my book that it is so i will only say here that it is suurely more probable that one pooooting himself forward to attract the wayfarer in the desert would compare himself to a friendly and persuadable guide or courier rather than to a voracious monster sometimes the true origin is very hard to trace as in the inn that commemorates our great moslem warrior amir ali ben bhoze whom you have so quaintly abbreviated into admiral benbow sometimes it is even more difficult for the seeker after truth there is a place of drink near to here called the old ship the eyes of the girl remained on the ring of the horizon as rigid as the ring itself but her whole face had coloured and altered the sands were almost emptied by now the atheist was as nonexistent as his god and those who had hoped to know what was being done to the paper boxes had gone away to their tea without knowing it but the young woman still leaned on the railing her face was suddenly alive and it looked as if her body could not move it shood be admitted bleated the old man with the green umbrella that there is no literally selfevident trace of the asiatic nomenclature in the words the old ship but even here the seeeeker after truth can poot himself in touch with facts i questioned the proprietor of the old ship who is according to such notes as i have kept a mr pumph the girls lip trembled poor old hump she said why id forgotten about him he must be very nearly as worried as i am i hope this man wont be too silly about this id rather it werent about this and mr pumph toold me the inn was named by a vary intimate friend of his an irishman who had been a captain in the britannic royal navy but had resigned his poost in anger at the treatment of ireland though quitting the service he retained joost enough of the superstition of your western sailors to wish his friends inn to be named after his old ship but as the name of the ship was the united kingdom his female pupil if she could not exactly be said to be sitting at his feet was undoubtedly leaning out very eagerly above his head amid the solitude of the sands she called out in a loud and clear voice can you tell me the captains name the old gentleman jumped blinked and stared like a startled owl having been talking for hours as if he had an audience of thousands he seemed suddenly very much embarrassed to find that he had even an audience of one by this time they seemed to be almost the only human creatures along the shore almost the only living creatures except the seagulls the sun in dropping finally seemed to have broken as a blood orange might break and lines of bloodred light were spilt along the split low level skies this abrupt and belated brilliance took all the colour out of the mans red cap and green umbrella but his dark figure distinct against the sea and the sunset remained the same save that it was more agitated than before the name he said the captains name i i understood it was dalroy but what i wish to indicate what i wish to expound is that here again the seeker after truth can find the connection of his ideas it was explained to me by mr pumph that he was rearranging the place of festivity in no inconsiderable proportion because of the anticipated return of the captain in question who had as it appeared taken service in some not very large navy but had left it and was coming home now mark all of you my friends he said to the seagulls that even here the chain of logic holds he said it to the seagulls because the young lady after staring at him with starry eyes for a moment and leaning heavily on the railing had turned her back and disappeared rapidly into the twilight after her hasty steps had fallen silent there was no other noise than the faint but powerful purring of the now distant sea the occasional shriek of a seabird and the continuous sound of a soliloquy mark all of you continued the man flourishing his green umbrella so furiously that it almost flew open like a green flag unfurled and then striking it deep in the sand in the sand in which his fighting fathers had so often struck their tents mark all of you this marvellous fact that when being for a time for a time astonishedembarrassed brought up as you would say short by the absence of any absolute evidence of eastern influence in the phrase the old ship i inquired from what country the captain was returning mr pumph said to me in solemnity from turkey from turkey from the nearest country of the religion i know men say it is not our country that no man knows where we come from of what is our country what does it matter where we come from if we carry a message from paradise with a great galloping of horses we carry it and have no time to stop in places but what we bring is the only creed that has regarded what you will call in your great words the virginity of a mans reason that has put no man higher than a prophet and has respected the solitude of god and again he spread his arms out as if addressing a mass meeting of millions all alone on the dark seashore chapter ii the end of olive island the great seadragon of the changing colours that wriggles round the world like a chameleon was pale green as it washed on pebblewick but strong blue where it broke on the ionian isles one of the innumerable islets hardly more than a flat white rock in the azure expanse was celebrated as the isle of olives not because it was rich in such vegetation but because by some freak of soil or climate two or three little olives grew there to an unparalleled height even in the full heat of the south it is very unusual for an olive tree to grow any taller than a small pear tree but the three olives that stood up as signals on this sterile place might well be mistaken except for the shape for moderate sized pines or larches of the north it was also connected with some ancient greek legend about pallas the patroness of the olive for all that sea was alive with the first fairyland of hellas and from the platform of marble under the olive trees could be seen the grey outline of ithaca on the island and under the trees was a table set in the open air and covered with papers and inkstands at the table were sitting four men two in uniform and two in plain black clothes aidesdecamps equerries and such persons stood in a group in the background and behind them a string of two or three silent battleships lay along the sea for peace was being given to europe there had just come to an end the long agony of one of the many unsuccessful efforts to break the strength of turkey and save the small christian tribes there had been many other such meetings in the later phases of the matter as one after another the smaller nations gave up the struggle or the greater nations came in to coerce them but the interested parties had now dwindled to these four for the powers of europe being entirely agreed on the necessity for peace on a turkish basis were content to leave the last negotiations to england and germany who could be trusted to enforce it there was a representative of the sultan of course and there was a representative of the only enemy of the sultan who had not hitherto come to terms for one tiny power had alone carried on the war month after month and with a tenacity and temporary success that was a new ninedays marvel every morning an obscure and scarcely recognized prince calling himself the king of ithaca had filled the eastern mediterranean with exploits that were not unworthy of the audacious parallel that the name of his island suggested poets could not help asking if it were odysseus come again patriotic greeks even if they themselves had been forced to lay down their arms could not help feeling curious as to what greek race or name was boasted by the new and heroic royal house it was therefore with some amusement that the world at last discovered that the descendant of ulysses was a cheeky irish adventurer named patrick dalroy who had once been in the english navy had got into a quarrel through his fenian sympathies and resigned his commission since then he had seen many adventures in many uniforms and always got himself or some one else into hot water with an extraordinary mixture of cynicism and quixotry in his fantastic little kingdom of course he had been his own general his own admiral his own foreign secretary and his own ambassador but he was always careful to follow the wishes of his people in the essentials of peace and war and it was at their direction that he had come to lay down his sword at last besides his professional skill he was chiefly famous for his enormous bodily strength and stature it is the custom in newspapers nowadays to say that mere barbaric muscular power is valueless in modern military actions but this view may be as much exaggerated as its opposite in such wars as these of the near east where whole populations are slightly armed and personal assault is common a leader who can defend his head often has a real advantage and it is not true even in a general way that strength is of no use this was admitted by lord ivywood the english minister who was pointing out in detail to king patrick the hopeless superiority of the light pattern of turkish field gun and the king of ithaca remarking that he was quite convinced said he would take it with him and ran away with it under his arm it would be conceded by the greatest of the turkish warriors the terrifying oman pasha equally famous for his courage in war and his cruelty in peace but who carried on his brow a scar from patricks sword taken after three hours mortal combat and taken without spite or shame be it said for the turk is always at his best in that game nor would the quality be doubted by mr hart a financial friend of the german minister whom patrick dalroy after asking him which of his front windows he would prefer to be thrown into threw into his bedroom window on the first floor with so considerate an exactitude that he alighted on the bed where he was in a position to receive any medical attention but when all is said one muscular irish gentleman on an island cannot fight all europe for ever and he came with a kind of gloomy good humour to offer the terms now dictated to him by his adopted country he could not even knock all the diplomatists down for which he possessed both the power and the inclination for he realised with the juster part of his mind that they were only obeying orders as he was so he sat heavily and sleepily at the little table in the green and white uniform of the navy of ithaca invented by himself a big bull of a man monstrously young for his size with a bull neck and two blue bulls eyes for eyes and red hair rising so steadily off his scalp that it looked as if his head had caught fire as some said it had the most dominant person present was the great oman pasha himself with his strong face starved by the asceticism of war his hair and mustache seeming rather blasted with lightning than blanched with age a red fez on his head and between the red fez and mustache a scar at which the king of ithaca did not look his eyes had an awful lack of expression lord ivywood the english minister was probably the handsomest man in england save that he was almost colourless both in hair and complexion against that blue marble sea he might almost have been one of its old marble statues that are faultless in line but show nothing but shades of grey or white it seemed a mere matter of the luck of lighting whether his hair looked dull silver or pale brown and his splendid mask never changed in colour or expression he was one of the last of the old parliamentary orators and yet he was probably a comparatively young man he could make anything he had to mention blossom into verbal beauty yet his face remained dead while his lips were alive he had little oldfashioned ways as out of old parliaments for instance he would always stand up as in a senate to speak to those three other men alone on a rock in the ocean in all this he perhaps appeared more personal in contrast to the man sitting next to him who never spoke at all but whose face seemed to speak for him he was dr gluck the german minister whose face had nothing german about it neither the german vision nor the german sleep his face was as vivid as a highly coloured photograph and altered like a cinema but his scarlet lips never moved in speech his almond eyes seemed to shine with all the shifting fires of the opal his small curled black mustache seemed sometimes almost to hoist itself afresh like a live black snake but there came from him no sound he put a paper in front of lord ivywood lord ivywood took a pair of eyeglasses to read it and looked ten years older by the act it was merely a statement of agenda of the few last things to be settled at this last conference the first item ran the ithacan ambassador asks that the girls taken to harems after the capture of pylos be restored to their families this cannot be granted lord ivywood rose the mere beauty of his voice startled everyone who had not heard it before your excellencies and gentlemen he said a statement to whose policy i by no means assent but to whose historic status i could not conceivably aspire has familiarised you with a phrase about peace with honour but when we have to celebrate a peace between such historic soldiers as oman pasha and his majesty the king of ithaca i think we may say that it is peace with glory he paused for half an instant yet even the silence of sea and rock seemed full of multitudinous applause so perfectly had the words been spoken i think there is but one thought among us whatever our many just objections through these long and harassing months of negotiations i think there is but one thought now that the peace may be as full as the war that the peace may be as fearless as the war once more he paused an instant and felt a phantom clapping as it were not from the hands but the heads of the men he went on if we are to leave off fighting we may surely leave off haggling a statute of limitations or if you will an amnesty is surely proper when so sublime a peace seals so sublime a struggle and if there be anything in which an old diplomatist may advise you i would most strongly say this that there should be no new disturbance of whatever amicable or domestic ties have been formed during this disturbed time i will admit i am sufficiently oldfashioned to think any interference with the interior life of the family a precedent of no little peril nor will i be so illiberal as not to extend to the ancient customs of islam what i would extend to the ancient customs of christianity a suggestion has been brought before us that we should enter into a renewed war of recrimination as to whether certain women have left their homes with or without their own consent i can conceive no controversy more perilous to begin or more impossible to conclude i will venture to say that i express all your thoughts when i say that whatever wrongs may have been wrought on either side the homes the marriages the family arrangements of this great ottoman empire shall remain as they are today no one moved except patrick dalroy who put his hand on his swordhilt for a moment and looked at them all with bursting eyes then his hand fell and he laughed out loud and sudden lord ivywood took no notice but picked up the agenda paper again and again fitted on the glasses that made him look older he read the second item needless to say not aloud the german minister with the far from german face had written this note for him both coote and the bernsteins insist there must be chinese for the marble greeks cannot be trusted in the quarries just now but while continued lord ivywood we desire these fundamental institutions such as the moslem family to remain as they are even at this moment we do not assent to social stagnation nor do we say for one moment that the great tradition of islam is capable alone of sustaining the necessities of the near east but i would seriously ask your excellencies why should we be so vain as to suppose that the only cure for the near east is of necessity the near west if new ideas are needed if new blood is needed would it not be more natural to appeal to those most living those most laborious civilisations which form the vast reserve of the orient asia in europe if my friend oman pasha will allow me the criticism has hitherto been asia in arms may we not yet see asia in europe and yet asia in peace these at least are the reasons which lead me to consent to a scheme of colonisation patrick dalroy sprang erect pulling himself out of his seat by clutching at an olivebranch above his head he steadied himself by putting one hand on the trunk of the tree and simply stared at them all there fell on him the huge helplessness of mere physical power he could throw them into the sea but what good would that do more men on the wrong side would be accredited to the diplomatic campaign and the only man on the right side would be discredited for anything he shook the branching olive tree above him in his fury but he did not for one moment disturb lord ivywood who had just read the third item on his private agenda oman pasha insists on the destruction of the vineyards and was by this time engaged in a peroration which afterwards became famous and may be found in many rhetorical text books and primers he was well into the middle of it before dalroys rage and wonder allowed him to follow the words do we indeed owe nothing the diplomatist was saying to that gesture of high refusal in which so many centuries ago the great arabian mystic put the winecup from his lips do we owe nothing to the long vigil of a valiant race the long fast by which they have testified against the venomous beauty of the vine ours is an age when men come more and more to see that the creeds hold treasures for each other that each religion has a secret for its neighbour that faith unto faith uttereth speech and church unto church showeth knowledge if it be true and i claim again the indulgence of oman pasha when i say i think it is true that we of the west have brought some light to islam in the matter of the preciousness of peace and of civil order may we not say that islam in answer shall give us peace in a thousand homes and encourage us to cut down that curse that has done so much to thwart and madden the virtues of western christendom already in my own country the orgies that made horrible the nights of the noblest families are no more already the legislature takes more and more sweeping action to deliver the populace from the bondage of the alldestroying drug surely the prophet of mecca is reaping his harvest the cession of the disputed vineyards to the greatest of his champions is of all acts the most appropriate to this day to this happy day that may yet deliver the east from the curse of war and the west from the curse of wine the gallant prince who meets us here at last to offer an olive branch even more glorious than his sword may well have our sympathy if he himself views the cession with some sentimental regret but i have little doubt that he also will live to rejoice in it at last and i would remind you that it is not the vine alone that has been the sign of the glory of the south there is another sacred tree unstained by loose and violent memories guiltless of the blood of pentheus or of orpheus and the broken lyre we shall pass from this place in a little while as all things pass and perish far called our navies melt away on dune and headland sinks the fire and all our pomp of yesterday is one with nineveh and tyre but so long as sun can shine and soil can nourish happier men and women after us shall look on this lovely islet and it shall tell its own story for they shall see these three holy olive trees lifted in everlasting benediction over the humble spot out of which came the peace of the world the other two men were staring at patrick dalroy his hand had tightened on the tree and a giant billow of effort went over his broad breast a small stone jerked itself out of the ground at the foot of the tree as if it were a grasshopper jumping and then the coiled roots of the olive tree rose very slowly out of the earth like the limbs of a dragon lifting itself from sleep i offer an olive branch said the king of ithaca totteringly leaning the loose tree so that its vast shadow much larger than itself fell across the whole council an olive branch he gasped more glorious than my sword also heavier then he made another effort and tossed it into the sea below the german who was no german had put up his arm in apprehension when the shadow fell across him now he got up and edged away from the table seeing that the wild irishman was tearing up the second tree this one came out more easily and before he flung it after the first he stood with it a moment looking like a man juggling with a tower lord ivywood showed more firmness but he rose in tremendous remonstrance only the turkish pasha still sat with blank eyes immovable dalroy rent out the last tree and hurled it leaving the island bare there said dalroy when the third and last olive had splashed in the tide now i will go i have seen something today that is worse than death and the name of it is peace oman pasha rose and held out his hand you are right he said in french and i hope we meet again in the only life that is a good life where are you going now i am going said dalroy dreamily to the old ship do you mean asked the turk that you are going back to the warships of the english king no answered the other i am going back to the old ship that is behind the apple trees by pebblewick where the ule flows among the trees i fear i shall never see you there after an instants hesitation he wrung the red hand of the great tyrant and walked to his boat without a glance at the diplomatists chapter iii the sign of the old ship upon few of the children of men has the surname of pump fallen and of these few have been maddened into naming a child humphrey in addition to it to such extremity however had the parents of the innkeeper at the old ship proceeded that their son might come at last to be called hump by his dearest friends and pumph by an aged turk with a green umbrella all this or all he knew of it he endured with a sour smile for he was of a stoical temper mr humphrey pump stood outside his inn which stood almost on the seashore screened only by one line of apple trees dwarfed twisted and salted by the sea air but in front of it was a highly banked bowling green and behind it the land sank abruptly so that one very steep sweeping road vanished into the depth and mystery of taller trees mr pump was standing immediately under his trim sign which stood erect in the turf a wooden pole painted white and suspending a square white board also painted white but further decorated with a highly grotesque blue ship such as a child might draw but into which mr pumps patriotism had insinuated a disproportionately large red st georges cross mr humphrey pump was a man of middle size with very broad shoulders wearing a sort of shooting suit with gaiters indeed he was engaged at the moment in cleaning and reloading a doublebarrelled gun a short but powerful weapon which he had invented or at least improved himself and which though eccentric enough as compared with latest scientific arms was neither clumsy nor necessarily out of date for pump was one of those handy men who seem to have a hundred hands like briareus he made nearly everything for himself and everything in his house was slightly different from the same thing in anyone elses house he was also as cunning as pan or a poacher in everything affecting every bird or dish every leaf or berry in the woods his mind was a rich soil of subconscious memories and traditions and he had a curious kind of gossip so allusive as to almost amount to reticence for he always took it for granted that everyone knew his county and its tales as intimately as he did so he would mention the most mysterious and amazing things without relaxing a muscle on his face which seemed to be made of knotted wood his dark brown hair ended in two rudimentary side whiskers giving him a slightly horsy look but in the oldfashioned sportsmans style his smile was rather wry and crabbed but his brown eyes were kindly and soft he was very english as a rule his movements though quick were cool but on this occasion he put down the gun on the table outside the inn in a rather hurried manner and came forward dusting his hands in an unusual degree of animation and even defiance beyond the goblin green apple trees and against the sea had appeared the tall slight figure of a girl in a dress about the colour of copper and a large shady hat under the hat her face was grave and beautiful though rather swarthy she shook hands with mr pump then he very ceremoniously put a chair for her and called her lady joan i thought i would like a look at the old place she said we have had some happy times here when we were boys and girls i suppose you hardly see any of your old friends now very little answered pump rubbing his short whisker reflectively lord ivywoods become quite a methody parson you know since he took the place hes pulling down beershops right and left and mr charles was sent to australia for lying down flat at the funeral pretty stiff i call it but the old lady was a terror do you ever hear asked lady joan brett carelessly of that irishman captain dalroy yes more often than from the rest answered the innkeeper he seems to have done wonders in this greek business ah he was a sad loss to the navy they insulted his country said the girl looking at the sea with a heightened colour after all ireland was his country and he had a right to resent it being spoken of like that and when they found hed painted him green went on mr pump painted him what asked lady joan painted captain dawson green continued mr pump in colourless tones captain dawson said green was the colour of irish traitors so dalroy painted him green it was a great temptation no doubt with this fence being painted at the time and the pail of stuff there but of course it had a very prejudicial effect on his professional career what an extraordinary story said the staring lady joan breaking into a rather joyless laugh it must go down among your county legends i never heard that version before why it might be the origin of the green man over there by the town oh no said pump simply thats been there since before waterloo times poor old noyle had it until they put him away you remember old noyle lady joan still alive i hear and still writing loveletters to queen victoria only of course they arent posted now have you heard from your irish friend lately asked the girl keeping a steady eye on the skyline yes i had a letter last week answered the innkeeper it seems not impossible that he may return to england hes been acting for one of these greek places and the negotiations seem to be concluded its a queer thing that his lordship himself was the english minister in charge of them you mean lord ivywood said lady joan rather coldly yes he has a great career before him evidently i wish he hadnt got his knife into us so much chuckled pump i dont believe therell be an inn left in england but the ivywoods were always cranky its only fair to him to remember his grandfather i think its very ungallant on your part said lady joan with a mournful smile to ask a lady to remember his grandfather you know what i mean lady joan said her host good humouredly and i never was hard on the case myself we all have our little ways i shouldnt like it done to my pig but i dont see why a man shouldnt have his own pig in his own pew with him if he likes it it wasnt a free seat it was the family pew lady joan broke out laughing again what horrible things you do seem to have heard of she said well i must be going mr hump i mean mr pump i used to call you hump oh hump do you think any of us will ever be happy again i suppose it rests with providence he said looking at the sea oh do say providence again cried the girl its as good as masterman ready with which inconsequent words she betook herself again to the path by the apple trees and walked back by the sea front to pebblewick the inn of the old ship lay a little beyond the old fishing village of pebblewick and that again was separated by an empty halfmile or so from the new wateringplace of pebblewickonsea but the darkhaired lady walked steadily along the seafront on a sort of parade which had been stretched out to east and west in the insane optimism of wateringplaces and as she approached the more crowded part looked more and more carefully at the groups on the beach most of them were much the same as she had seen them more than a month before the seekers after truth as the man in the fez would say who assembled daily to find out what the man was doing with the paperboxes had not found out yet neither had they wearied of their intellectual pilgrimage pennies were still thrown to the thundering atheist in acknowledgment of his incessant abuse and this was all the more mysterious because the crowd was obviously indifferent and the atheist was obviously sincere the man with the long neck who led low church hymns with a little wooden spade had indeed disappeared for childrens services of this kind are generally a moving feast but the man whose only claim consisted of carrots round his hat was still there and seemed to have even more money than before but lady joan could see no sign of the little old man in the fez she could only suppose that he had failed entirely and being in a bitter mood she told herself bitterly that he had sunk out of sight precisely because there was in his rubbish a touch of unearthly and insane clearheadedness of which all these vulgar idiots were incapable she did not confess to herself consciously that what had made both the man in the fez and the man at the inn interesting was the subject of which they had spoken as she walked on rather wearily along the parade she caught sight of a girl in black with faint fair hair and a tremulous intelligent face which she was sure she had seen before pulling together all her aristocratic training for the remembering of middle class people she managed to remember that this was a miss browning who had done typewriting work for her a year or two before and immediately went forward to greet her partly out of genuine good nature and partly as a relief from her own rather dreary thoughts her tone was so seriously frank and friendly that the lady in black summoned the social courage to say ive so often wanted to introduce you to my sister whos much cleverer than i am though she does live at home which i suppose is very oldfashioned she knows all sorts of intellectual people she is talking to one of them now this prophet of the moon that everyones talking about do let me introduce you lady joan brett had met many prophets of the moon and of other things but she had the spontaneous courtesy which redeems the vices of her class and she followed miss browning to a seat on the parade she greeted miss brownings sister with glowing politeness and this may really be counted to her credit for she had great difficulty in looking at miss brownings sister at all for on the seat beside her still in a red fez but in a brilliantly new black frock coat and every appearance of prosperity sat the old gentleman who had lectured on the sands about the inns of england he lectured at our ethical society whispered miss browning on the word alcohol just on the word alcohol he was perfectly thrilling all about arabia and algebra you know and how everything comes from the east you really would be interested i am interested said lady joan poot it to yourselfs the man in the fez was saying to miss brownings sister joost what sort of meaning the names of your ince can have if they do not commemorate the unlimitable influence of islam there is a vary populous inn in london one of the most distinguished one of the most of the centre and it is called the horseshoe now my friendss why should anyone commemorate a horseshoe it iss but an appendage to a creature more interesting than itself i have already demonstrated to you that the very fact that you have in your town a place of drink called the bool i should like to ask began lady joan suddenly a place of drink called the bool went on the man in the fez deaf to all distractions and i have urged that the bool is a disturbing thought while the bulbul is a reassuring thought but even you my friends would not name a place after a ring in a bools nose and not after the bool why then name an equivalent place after the shoo the mere shoo upon a horses hoof and not after the noble horse surely it is clear surely it is evident that the term horseshoe is a cryptic term an esoteric term a term made during the days when the ancient moslem faith of this english country was oppressed by the passing superstition of the galileans that bent shape that duplex curving shape which you call horseshoe is it not clearly the crescent and he cast his arms wide as he had done on the sands the crescent of the prophet of the only god i should like to ask began lady joan again how you would explain the name of the inn called the green man just behind that row of houses exactly exactly cried the prophet of the moon in almost insane excitement the seeker after truth could not at all probably find a more perfect example of these principles my friendss how could there be a green man you are acquainted with green grass with green leaves with green cheese with green chartreuse i ask if any one of you however wide her social circle has ever been acquainted with a green man surely surely it is evident my friendss that this is an imperfect version an abbreviated version of the original words what can be clearer than that the original expression was the greenturband man in allusion to the wellknown uniform of the descendants of the prophet turband surely is just the sort of word exactly the sort of foreign and unfamiliar word that might easily be slurred over and ultimately suppressed there is a legend in these parts said lady joan steadily that a great hero hearing the colour that was sacred to his holy island insulted really poured it over his enemy for a reply a legend a fable cried the man in the fez with another radiant and rational expansion of the hands is it not evident that no such thing can have really happened oh yes it really happened said the young lady softly there is not much to comfort one in this world but there are some things oh it really happened and taking a graceful farewell of the group she resumed her rather listless walk along the parade chapter iv the inn finds wings mr humphrey pump stood in front of his inn once more the cleaned and loaded gun still lay on the table and the white sign of the ship still swung in the slight sea breeze over his head but his leatherish features were knotted over a new problem he held two letters in his hand letters of a very different sort but letters that pointed to the same difficult problem the first ran dear hump im so bothered that i simply must call you by the old name again you understand ive got to keep in with my people lord ivywood is a sort of cousin of mine and for that and some other reasons my poor old mother would just die if i offended him you know her heart is weak you know everything there is to know in this county well i only write to warn you that something is going to be done against your dear old inn i dont know what this countrys coming to only a month or two ago i saw a shabby old pantaloon on the beach with a green gamp talking the craziest stuff you ever heard in your life three weeks ago i heard he was lecturing at ethical societies whatever they are for a handsome salary well when i was last at ivywood i must go because mamma likes it there was the living lunatic again in evening dress and talked about by people who really know i mean who know better lord ivywood is entirely under his influence and thinks him the greatest prophet the world has ever seen and lord ivywood is not a fool one cant help admiring him mamma i think wants me to do more than admire him i am telling you everything hump because i think perhaps this is the last honest letter i shall ever write in the world and i warn you seriously that lord ivywood is sincere which is perfectly terrible he will be the biggest english statesman and he does really mean to ruin the old ships if ever you see me here again taking part in such work i hope you may forgive me somebody we mentioned whom i shall never see again i leave to your friendship it is the second best thing i can give and i am not sure it may not be better than the first would have been goodbye j b this letter seemed to distress mr pump rather than puzzle him it ran as follows sir the committee of the imperial commission of liquor control is directed to draw your attention to the fact you have disregarded the committees communications under section a of the act for the regulation of places of public entertainment and that you are now under section c of the act amending the act for the regulation of places of public entertainment aforesaid the charges on which prosecution will be founded are as follows violation of subsection f of the act which enacts that no pictorial signs shall be exhibited before premises of less than the ratable value of per annum violation of subsection d of the act which enacts that no liquor containing alcohol shall be sold in any inn hotel tavern or publichouse except when demanded under a medical certificate from one of the doctors licensed by the state medical council or in the specially excepted cases of claridges hotel and the criterion bar where urgency has already been proved as you have failed to acknowledge previous communications on this subject this is to warn you that legal steps will be taken immediately we are yours truly ivywood president j leveson secretary mr humphrey pump sat down at the table outside his inn and whistled in a way which combined with his little whiskers made him for the moment seem literally like an ostler then the very real wit and learning he had returned slowly into his face and with his warm brown eyes he considered the cold grey sea there was not much to be got out of the sea humphrey pump might drown himself in the sea which would be better for humphrey pump than being finally separated from the old ship england might be sunk under the sea which would be better for england than never again having such places as the old ship but these were not serious remedies nor rationally attainable and pump could only feel that the sea had simply warped him as it had warped his apple trees the sea was a dreary business altogether there was only one figure walking on the sands it was only when the figure drew nearer and nearer and grew to more than human size that he sprang to his feet with a cry also the level light of morning lit the mans hair and it was red the late king of ithaca came casually and slowly up the slope of the beach that led to the old ship he had landed in a boat from a battleship that could still be seen near the horizon and he still wore the astounding uniform of applegreen and silver which he had himself invented as that of a navy that had never existed very much and which now did not exist at all he had a straight naval sword at his side for the terms of his capitulation had never required him to surrender it and inside the uniform and beside the sword there was what there always had been a big and rather bewildered man with rough red hair whose misfortune was that he had good brains but that his bodily strength and bodily passions were a little too strong for his brains he had flung his crashing weight on the chair outside the inn before the innkeeper could find words to express his astounded pleasure in seeing him his first words were have you got any rum then as if feeling that his attitude needed explanation he added i suppose i shall never be a sailor again after tonight so i must have rum humphrey pump had a talent for friendship and understood his old friend he went into the inn without a word and came back idly pushing or rolling with an alternate foot as if he were playing football with two footballs at once two objects that rolled very easily one was a big keg or barrel of rum and the other a great solid drum of a cheese among his thousand other technical tricks he had a way of tapping a cask without a tap or anything that could impair its revolutionary or revolving qualities he was feeling in his pocket for the instrument with which he solved such questions when his irish friend suddenly sat bolt upright as one startled out of sleep and spoke with his strongest and most unusual brogue oh thank ye hump a thousand times and i dont think i really want something to drink at arl now i know i can have it i dont seem to want it at arl but hwhat i do want and he suddenly dashed his big fist on the little table so that one of its legs leapt and nearly snapped hwhat i do want is some sort of account of whats happening in this england of yours that shant be just obviously rubbish ah said pump fingering the two letters thoughtfully and what do you mean by rubbish i carl it rubbish cried patrick dalroy when ye put the koran into the bible and not the apocrypha and i carl it rubbish when a mad parsons allowed to propose to put a crescent on st pauls cathedral i know the turks are our allies now but they often were before and i never heard that palmerston or colin campbell had any truck with such trash lord ivywood is very enthusiastic i know said pump with a restrained amusement he was saying only the other day at the flower show here that the time had come for a full unity between christianity and islam something called chrislam perhaps said the irishman with a moody eye he was gazing across the grey and purple woodlands that stretched below them at the back of the inn and into which the steep white road swept downwards and disappeared the steep road looked like the beginning of an adventure and he was an adventurer but you exaggerate you know went on pump polishing his gun about the crescent on st pauls it wasnt exactly that what dr moole suggested i think was some sort of double emblem you know combining cross and crescent and carled the crescent muttered dalroy and you cant call dr moole a parson either went on mr humphrey pump polishing industriously why they say hes a sort of atheist or what they call an agnostic like squire brunton who used to bite elm trees by marley the grand folks have these fashions captain but theyve never lasted long that i know of i think its serious this time said his friend shaking his big red head this is the last inn on this coast and will soon be the last inn in england do you remember the saracens head in plumsea along the shore there i know assented the innkeeper my aunt was there when he hanged his mother but its a charming place i passed there just now and it has been destroyed said dalroy destroyed by fire asked pump pausing in his gunscrubbing no said dalroy destroyed by lemonade theyve taken away its license or whatever you call it i made a song about it which ill sing to you now and with an astounding air of suddenly revived spirits he roared in a voice like thunder the following verses to a simple but spirited tune of his own invention the saracens head looks down the lane where we shall never drink wine again for the wicked old women who feel wellbred have turned to a teashop the saracens head the saracens head out of araby came king richard riding in arms like flame and where he established his folk to be fed he set up his spear and the saracens head but the saracens head outlived the kings it thought and it thought of most horrible things of health and of soap and of standard bread and of saracen drinks at the saracens head hullo cried pump with another low whistle why here comes his lordship and i suppose that young man in the goggles is a committee or something let him come said dalroy and continued in a yet more earthquake bellow so the saracens head fulfils its name they drink no wine a ridiculous game and i shall wonder until im dead how it ever came into the saracens head as the last echo of this lyrical roar rolled away among the appletrees and down the steep white road into the woods captain dalroy leaned back in his chair and nodded good humouredly to lord ivywood who was standing on the lawn with his usual cold air but with slightly compressed lips behind him was a dark young man with double eyeglasses and a number of printed papers in his hand presumably j leveson secretary in the road outside stood a group of three which struck pump as strangely incongruous like a group in a three act farce the first was a police inspector in uniform the second was a workman in a leather apron more or less like a carpenter and the third was an old man in a scarlet turkish fez but otherwise dressed in very fashionable english clothes in which he did not seem very comfortable he was explaining something about the inn to the policeman and the carpenter who appeared to be restraining their amusement fine song that my lord said dalroy with cheerful egotism ill sing you another and he cleared his throat mr pump said lord ivywood in his belllike and beautiful voice i thought i would come in person if only to make it clear that every indulgence has been shown you the mere date of this inn brings it within the statute of it was erected when my great grandfather was lord of the manor here though i believe it then bore a different name and ah my lord broke in pump with a sigh id rather deal with your great grandfather i would though he married a hundred negresses instead of one than see a gentleman of your family taking away a poor mans livelihood the act is specially designed in the interests of the relief of poverty proceeded lord ivywood in an unruffled manner and its final advantages will accrue to all citizens alike he turned for an instant to the dark secretary saying you have that second report and received a folded paper in answer it is here fully explained said lord ivywood putting on his elderly eyeglasses that the purpose of the act is largely to protect the savings of the more humble and necessitous classes i find in paragraph three we strongly advise that the deleterious element of alcohol be made illegal save in such few places as the government may specially exempt for parliamentary or other public reasons and that the provocative and demoralising display on inn signs be strictly forbidden except in the cases thus specially exempted the absence of such temptations will in our opinion do much to improve the precarious financial conditions of the working class that disposes i think of any such suggestion as mr pumps that our inevitable acts of social reform are in any sense oppressive to mr pumps prejudice it may appear for the moment to bear hardly upon him but and here lord ivywoods voice took one of its moving oratorical turns what better proof could we desire of the insidiousness of the sleepy poison we denounce what better evidence could we offer of the civic corruption that we seek to cure than the very fact that good and worthy men of established repute in the county can by living in such places as these become so stagnant and sodden and unsocial whether through the fumes of wine or through meditations as maudlin about the past that they consider the case solely as their own case and laugh at the long agony of the poor captain dalroy had been studying ivywood with a very bright blue eye and he spoke now much more quietly than he generally did excuse me one moment my lord he said but there was one point in your important explanation which i am not sure i have got right do i understand you to say that though signboards are to be generally abolished yet where if anywhere they are retained the right to sell fermented liquor will be retained also in other words though an englishman may at last find only one innsign left in england yet if the place has an innsign it will also have your gracious permission to be really an inn lord ivywood had an admirable command of temper which had helped him much in his career as a statesman he did not waste time in wrangling about the captains locus standi in the matter he replied quite simply yes your statement of the facts is correct whenever i find an innsign permitted by the police i may go in and ask for a glass of beer also permitted by the police if you find any such yes answered ivywood quite temperately but we hope soon to have removed them altogether captain patrick dalroy rose enormously from his seat with a sort of stretch and yawn well hump he said to his friend the best thing it seems to me is to take the important things with us with two sightstaggering kicks he sent the keg of rum and the round cheese flying over the fence in such a direction that they bounded on the descending road and rolled more and more rapidly down toward the dark woods into which the path disappeared then he gripped the pole of the innsign shook it twice and plucked it out of the turf like a tuft of grass it had all happened before anyone could move but as he strode out into the road the policeman ran forward dalroy smote him flat across face and chest with the wooden signboard so as to send him flying into the ditch on the other side of the road then turning on the man in the fez he poked him with the end of the pole so sharply in his new white waistcoat and watchchain as to cause him to sit down suddenly in the road looking very serious and thoughtful the dark secretary made a movement of rescue but humphrey pump with a cry caught up his gun from the table and pointed it at him which so alarmed j leveson secretary as to cause him almost to double up with his emotions the next moment pump with his gun under his arm was scampering down the hill after the captain who was scampering after the barrel and the cheese before the policeman had struggled out of the ditch they had all disappeared into the darkness of the forest lord ivywood who had remained firm through the scene without a sign of fear or impatience or i will add amusement held up his hand and stopped the policeman in his pursuit we should only make ourselves and the law ridiculous he said by pursuing those ludicrous rowdies now they cant escape or do any real harm in the state of modern communications what is far more important gentlemen is to destroy their stores and their base under the act of we have a right to confiscate and destroy any property in an inn where the law has been violated and he stood for hours on the lawn watching the smashing of bottles and the breaking up of casks and feeding on fanatical pleasure the pleasure his strange cold courageous nature could not get from food or wine or woman chapter v the astonishment of the agent lord ivywood shared the mental weakness of most men who have fed on books he ignored not the value but the very existence of other forms of information thus humphrey pump was perfectly aware that lord ivywood considered him an ignorant man who carried a volume of pickwick and could not be got to read any other book but lord ivywood was quite unaware that humphrey never looked at him without thinking that he could be most successfully hidden in a wood of small beeches as his greybrown hair and sallow ashen face exactly reproduced the three predominant tints of such a sylvan twilight mr pump i fear had sometimes partaken of partridge or pheasant in his early youth under circumstances in which lord ivywood was not only unconscious of the hospitality he was dispensing but would have sworn that it was physically impossible for anyone to elude the vigilance of his efficient system of gamekeeping but it is very unwise in one who counts himself superior to physical things to talk about physical impossibility lord ivywood was in error therefore when he said that the fugitives could not possibly escape in modern england you can do a great many things in modern england if you have noticed some things in fact which others know by pictures or current speech if you know for instance that most roadside hedges are taller and denser than they look and that even the largest man lying just behind them takes up far less room than you would suppose if you know that many natural sounds are much more like each other than the enlightened ear can believe as in the case of wind in leaves and of the sea if you know that it is easier to walk in socks than in boots if you know how to take hold of the ground if you know that the proportion of dogs who will bite a man under any circumstances is rather less than the proportion of men who will murder you in a railway carriage if you know that you need not be drowned even in a river unless the tide is very strong and unless you practise putting yourself into the special attitudes of a suicide if you know that country stations have objectless extra waiting rooms that nobody ever goes into and if you know that county folk will forget you if you speak to them but talk about you all day if you dont by the exercise of these and other arts and sciences humphrey pump was able to guide his friend across country mostly in the character of trespasser and occasionally in that of something like housebreaker and eventually with sign keg cheese and all to step out of a black pinewood onto a white road in a part of the county where they would not be sought for the present opposite them was a cornfield and on their right in the shades of the pine trees a cottage a very tumbledown cottage that seemed to have collapsed under its own thatch the redhaired irishmans face wore a curious smile he stuck the innsign erect in the road and went and hammered on the door it was opened tremulously by an old man with a face so wrinkled that the wrinkles seemed more distinctly graven than the features themselves which seemed lost in the labyrinth of them he might have crawled out of the hole in a gnarled tree and he might have been a thousand years old he did not seem to notice the signboard which stood rather to the left of the door and what life remained in his eyes seemed to awake in wonder at dalroys stature and strange uniform and the sword at his side i beg your pardon said the captain courteously i fear my uniform startles you it is lord ivywoods livery all his servants are to dress like this in fact i understand the tenants also and even yourself perhaps excuse my sword lord ivywood is very particular that every man should have a sword you know his beautiful eloquent way of putting his views how can we profess he was saying to me yesterday while i was brushing his trousers how can we profess that all men are brothers while we refuse to them the symbol of manhood or with what assurance can we claim it as a movement of modern emancipation to deny the citizen that which has in all ages marked the difference between the free man and the slave nor need we anticipate any such barbaric abuses as my honourable friend who is cleaning the knives has prophesied for this gift is a sublime act of confidence in your universal passion for the severe splendours of peace and he that has the right to strike is he who has learnt to spare talking all this nonsense with extreme rapidity and vast oratorical flourishes of the hand captain dalroy proceeded to trundle both the big cheese and the cask of rum into the house of the astonished cottager mr pump following with a grim placidity and his gun under his arm lord ivywood said dalroy setting the rum cask with a bump on the plain deal table wishes to take wine with you or more strictly speaking rum dont you run away my friend with any of these stories about lord ivywood being opposed to drink threebottle ivywood we call him in the kitchen but it must be rum nothing but rum for the ivywoods wine may be a mocker he was saying the other day and i particularly noted the phrasing which seemed to be very happy even for his lordship he was standing at the top of the steps and i stopped cleaning them to make a note of it wine may be a mocker strong drink may be raging but nowhere in the sacred pages will you find one word of censure of the sweeter spirit sacred to them that go down to the sea in ships no tongue of priest and prophet was ever lifted to break the sacred silence of holy writ about rum he then explained to me went on dalroy signing to pump to tap the cask according to his own technical secret that the great tip for avoiding any bad results that a bottle or two of rum might have on young and inexperienced people was to eat cheese with it particularly this kind of cheese that i have here ive forgotten its name cheddar said pump quite gravely but mind you continued the captain almost ferociously shaking his big finger in warning at the aged man mind you no bread with the cheese all the devastating ruin wrought by cheese and the once happy homes of this country has been due to the reckless and insane experiment of eating bread with it youll get no bread from me my friend indeed lord ivywood has given directions that the allusion to this ignorant and depraved habit shall be eliminated from the lords prayer have a drink he had already poured out a little of the spirit into two thick tumblers and a broken teacup which he had induced the aged man to produce and now solemnly pledged him thank ye kindly sir said the old man using his cracked voice for the first time then he drank and his old face changed as if it were an old horn lantern in which the flame began to rise ar he said my son he be a sailor i wish him a happy voyage said the captain and ill sing you a song about the first sailor there ever was in the world and who as lord ivywood acutely observes lived before the time of rum he sat down on a wooden chair and lifted his loud voice once more beating on the table with the broken teacup old noah he had an ostrich farm and fowls on the greatest scale he ate his egg with a ladle in an eggcup big as a pail and the soup he took was elephant soup and the fish he took was whale but they all were small to the cellar he took when he set out to sail and noah he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine i dont care where the water goes if it doesnt get into the wine the cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blinding off the brink as if it would wash the stars away as suds go down a sink the seven heavens came roaring down for the throats of hell to drink and noah he cocked his eye and said it looks like rain i think the water has drowned the matterhorn as deep as a mendip mine but i dont care where the water goes if it doesnt get into the wine but noah he sinned and we have sinned on tipsy feet we trod till a great big black teetotaller was sent to us for a rod and you cant get wine at a p s a or chapel or eisteddfod for the curse of water has come again because of the wrath of god and water is on the bishops board and the higher thinkers shrine but i dont care where the water goes if it doesnt get into the wine lord ivywoods favourite song concluded mr patrick dalroy drinking sing us a song yourself rather to the surprise of the two humourists the old gentleman actually began in a quavering voice to chant king george that lives in london town i hope they will defend his crown and bonyparte be quite put down on christmas day in the morning old squire is gone to the meet today all in his it is perhaps fortunate for the rapidity of this narrative that the old gentlemans favourite song which consists of fortyseven verses was interrupted by a curious incident the door of the cottage opened and a sheepishlooking man in corduroys stood silently in the room for a few seconds and then said without preface or further explanation four ale i beg your pardon inquired the polite captain four ale said the man with solidity then catching sight of humphrey seemed to find a few more words in his vocabulary morning mr pump didnt know as how youd moved the old ship mr pump with a twist of a smile pointed to the old man whose song had been interrupted mr marnes seeing after it now mr gowl said pump with the strict etiquette of the country side but hes got nothing but this rum in stock as yet betternowt said the laconic mr gowl and put down some money in front of the aged marne who eyed it wonderingly as he was turning with a farewell and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand the door once more moved letting in white sunlight and a man in a red neckerchief morning mr marne morning mr pump morning mr gowl said the man in the red neckerchief morning mr coote said the other three one after another have some rum mr coote asked humphrey pump genially thats all mr marnes got just now mr coote also had a little rum and also laid a little money under the rather vague gaze of the venerable cottager mr coote was just proceeding to explain that these were bad times but if you saw a sign you were all right still a lawyer up at grunton abbot had told him so when the company was increased and greatly excited by the arrival of a boisterous and popular tinker who ordered glasses all round and said he had his donkey and cart outside a prolonged rich and confused conversation about the donkey and cart then ensued in which the most varied views were taken of their merits and it gradually began to dawn on dalroy that the tinker was trying to sell them an idea suited to the romantic opportunism of his present absurd career suddenly swept over his mind and he rushed out to look at the cart and donkey the next moment he was back again asking the tinker what his price was and almost in the same breath offering a much bigger price than the tinker would have dreamed of asking this was considered however as a lunacy specially allowed to gentlemen the tinker had some more rum on the strength of the payment and then dalroy offering his excuses sealed up the cask and took it and the cheese to be stowed in the bottom of the cart the money however he still left lying in shining silver and copper before the silver beard of old marne no one acquainted with the quaint and often wordless camaraderie of the english poor will require to be told that they all went out and stared at him as he loaded the cart and saw to the harness of the donkey all except the old cottager who sat as if hypnotised by the sight of the money while they were standing there they saw coming down the white hot road where it curled over the hill a figure that gave them no pleasure even when it was a mere marching black spot in the distance it was a mr bullrose the agent of lord ivywoods estates mr bullrose was a short square man with a broad square head with ridges of close black curls on it with a heavy froglike face and starting suspicious eyes a man with a good silk hat but a square business jacket mr bullrose was not a nice man the agent on that sort of estate hardly ever is a nice man the landlord often is and even lord ivywood had an arctic magnanimity of his own which made most people want if possible to see him personally but mr bullrose was petty every really practical tyrant must be petty he evidently failed to understand the commotion in front of mr marnes partly collapsed cottage but he felt there must be something wrong about it he wanted to get rid of the cottage altogether and had not of course the faintest intention of giving the cottager any compensation for it he hoped the old man would die but in any case he could easily clear him out if it became suddenly necessary for he could not possibly pay the rent for this week the rent was not very much but it was immeasurably too much for the old man who had no conceivable way of borrowing or earning it that is where the chivalry of our aristocratic land system comes in goodbye my friends the enormous man in the fantastic uniform was saying all roads lead to rum as lord ivywood said in one of his gayer moments and we hope to be back soon establishing a first class hotel here of which prospectuses will soon be sent out the heavy froglike face of mr bullrose the agent grew uglier with astonishment and the eyes stood out more like a snails than a frogs the indefensible allusion to lord ivywood would in any case have caused a choleric intervention if it had not been swallowed up in the earthquake suggestion of an unlicensed hotel on the estate this again would have effected the explosion if that and everything else had not been struck still and rigid by the sight of a solid wooden signpost already erected outside old marnes miserable cottage ive got him now muttered mr bullrose he cant possibly pay and out he shall go and he walked swiftly towards the door of the cottage almost at the same moment that dalroy went to the donkeys head as if to lead it off along the road look here my man burst out bullrose the instant he was inside the cottage youve cooked yourself this time his lordship has been a great deal too indulgent with you but this is going to be the end of it the insolence of what youve done outside especially when you know his lordships wishes in such things has just put the lid on he stopped a moment and sneered so unless you happen to have the exact rent down to a farthing or two about you out you go were sick of your sort in a very awkward and fumbling manner the old man pushed a heap of coins across the table mr bullrose sat down suddenly on the wooden chair with his silk hat on and began counting them furiously he counted them once he counted them twice and he counted them again then he stared at them more steadily than the cottager had done where did you get this money he asked in a thick gross voice did you steal it i aint very spry for stealin said the old man in quavering comedy bullrose looked at him and then at the money and remembered with fury that ivywood was a just though cold magistrate on the bench well anyhow he cried in a hot heady way weve got enough against you to turn you out of this havent you broken the law my man to say nothing of the regulations for tenants in sticking up that fancy sign of yours outside the cottage eh the tenant was silent eh reiterated the agent ar replied the tenant have you or have you not a signboard outside this house shouted bullrose hammering the table the tenant looked at him for a long time with a patient and venerable face and then said mubbe yes mubbe no ill mubbe you cried mr bullrose springing up and sticking his silk hat on the back of his head i dont know whether you people are too drunk to see anything but i saw the thing with my own eyes out in the road come out and deny it if you dare ar said mr marne dubiously he tottered after the agent who flung open the door with a businesslike fury and stood outside on the threshold he stood there quite a long time and he did not speak deep in the hardened mud of his materialistic mind there had stirred two things that were its ancient enemies the old fairy tale in which every thing can be believed the new scepticism in which nothing can be believed not even ones own eyes there was no sign nor sign of a sign in the landscape on the withered face of the old man marne there was a faint renewal of that laughter that has slept since the middle ages chapter vi the hole in heaven that delicate ruby light which is one of the rarest but one of the most exquisite of evening effects warmed the land sky and seas as if the whole world were washed in wine and dyed almost scarlet the strong red head of patrick dalroy as he stood on the waste of furze and bracken where he and his friends had halted one of his friends was reexamining a short gun rather like a doublebarrelled carbine the other was eating thistles dalroy himself was idle and ruminant with his hands in his pockets and his eye on the horizon landwards the hills plains and woods lay bathed in the rosered light but it changed somewhat to purple to cloud and something like storm over the distant violet strip of sea it was towards the sea that he was staring suddenly he woke up and seemed almost to rub his eyes or at any rate to rub his red eyebrow why were on the road back of pebblewick he said thats the damned little tin chapel by the beach i know answered his friend and guide weve done the old hare trick doubled you know nine times out of ten its the best parson whitelady used to do it when they were after him for dogstealing ive pretty much followed his trail you cant do better than stick to the best examples they tell you in london that dick turpin rode to york well i know he didnt for my old grandfather up at cobbles end knew the turpins intimately threw one of them into the river on a christmas day but i think i can guess what he did do and how the tale got about if dick was wise he went flying up the old north road shouting york york or what not before people recognised him then if he did the thing properly he might half an hour afterwards walk down the strand with a pipe in his mouth they say old boney said go where you arent expected and i suppose as a soldier he was right but for a gentleman dodging the police like yourself it isnt exactly the right way of putting it i should say go where you ought to be expected and youll generally find your fellow creatures dont do what they ought about expecting any more than about anything else well this bit between here and the sea said the captain in a brown study i know it so well so well that that i rather wish id never seen it again do you know he asked suddenly pointing to a patch and pit of sand that showed white in the dusky heath a hundred yards away do you know what makes that spot so famous in history yes answered mr pump thats where old mother grouch shot the methodist you are in error said the captain such an incident as you describe would in no case call for special comment or regret no that spot is famous because a very badly brought up girl once lost a ribbon off a plait of black hair and somebody helped her to find it has the other person been well brought up asked pump with a faint smile no said dalroy staring at the sea he has been brought down then rousing himself again he made a gesture toward a further part of the heath do you know the remarkable history of that old wall the one beyond the last gorge over there no replied the other unless you mean dead mans circus and that happened further along i do not mean dead mans circus said the captain the remarkable history of that wall is that somebodys shadow once fell on it and that shadow was more desirable than the substance of all other living things it is this he cried almost violently resuming his flippant tone it is this circumstance hump and not the trivial and everyday incident of a dead man going to a circus to which you have presumed to compare it it is this historical event which lord ivywood is about to commemorate by rebuilding the wall with solid gold and greek marbles stolen by the turks from the grave of socrates enclosing a column of solid gold four hundred feet high and surmounted by a colossal equestrian statue of a bankrupt irishman riding backwards on a donkey he lifted one of his long legs over the animal as if about to pose for the group then swung back on both feet again and again looked at the purple limit of the sea do you know hump he said i think modern people have somehow got their minds all wrong about human life they seem to expect what nature has never promised and then try to ruin all that nature has really given at all those atheist chapels of ivywoods theyre always talking of peace perfect peace and utter peace and universal joy and souls that beat as one but they dont look any more cheerful than anyone else and the next thing they do is to start smashing a thousand good jokes and good stories and good songs and good friendships by pulling down the old ship he gave a glance at the loose signpost lying on the heath beside him almost as if to reassure himself that it was not stolen now it seems to me he went on that this is asking for too much and getting too little i dont know whether god means a man to have happiness in that all in all and utterly utter sense of happiness but god does mean a man to have a little fun and i mean to go on having it if i mustnt satisfy my heart i can gratify my humour the cynical fellows who think themselves so damned clever have a sort of saying be good and you will be happy but you will not have a jolly time the cynical fellows are quite wrong as they generally are they have got hold of the exact opposite of the truth god knows i dont set up to be good but even a rascal sometimes has to fight the world in the same way as a saint i think i have fought the world et militavi non sine whats the latin for having a lark i cant pretend to peace and joy and all the rest of it particularly in this original briarpatch i havent been happy hump but i have had a jolly time the sunset stillness settled down again save for the cropping of the donkey in the undergrowth and pump said nothing sympathetically and it was dalroy once more who took up his parable so i think theres too much of this playing on our emotions hump as this place is certainly playing the cat and banjo with mine damn it all there are other things to do with the rest of ones life i dont like all this fuss about feeling things it only makes people miserable in my present frame of mind im in favour of doing things all of which hump he said with a sudden lift of the voice that always went in him with a rushing irrational return of merely animal spirits all of which i have put into a song against songs that i will now sing you i shouldnt sing it here said humphrey pump picking up his gun and putting it under his arm you look large in this open place and you sound large but ill take you to the hole in heaven youve been talking about so much and hide you as i used to hide you from that tutor i couldnt catch his name man who could only get drunk on greek wine at squire wimpoles hump cried the captain i abdicate the throne of ithaca you are far wiser than ulysses here i have had my heart torn with temptations to ten thousand things between suicide and abduction and all by the mere sight of that hole in the heath where we used to have picnics and all that time id forgotten we used to call it the hole in heaven and by god what a good name in both senses i thought youd have remembered it captain said the innkeeper from the joke young mr matthews made in the heat of some savage hand to hand struggle in albania said mr dalroy sadly passing his palm across his brow i must have forgotten for one fatal instant the joke young mr matthews made it wasnt very good said mr pump simply ah his aunt was the one for things like that she went too far with old gudgeon though with these words he jumped and seemed to be swallowed up by the earth but they had merely strolled the few yards needed to bring them to the edge of the sandpit on the heath of which they had been speaking and it is one of the truths concealed by heaven from lord ivywood and revealed by heaven to mr pump that a hidingplace can be covered when you are close to it and yet be open and visible from some spot of vantage far off from the side by which they approached it the sudden hollow of sand a kind of collapsed chamber in the heath seemed covered with a natural curve of fern and furze and flashed out of sight like a fairy its all right he called out from under a floor or roof of leaves youll remember it all when you get here this is the place to sing your song captain lord bless me captain dont i remember your singing that irish song you made up at college bellowing it like a bull of bashan all about hearts and sleeves or some such things and her ladyship and the tutor never heard a breath because that bank of sand breaks everything its worth knowing all this you know its a pity its not part of a young gentlemans education now you shall sing me the song in favour of having no feelings or whatever you call it dalroy was staring about him at the cavern of his old picnics so forgotten and so startlingly familiar he seemed to have lost all thought of singing anything and simply to be groping in the dark house of his own boyhood there was a slight trickle from a natural spring in sandstone just under the ferns and he remembered they used to try to boil the water in a kettle he remembered a quarrel about who had upset the kettle which in the morbidity of first love had given him for days the tortures of the damned when the energetic pump broke once more through the rather thorny roof on an impulse to accumulate their other eccentric possessions patrick remembered about a thorn in a finger that made his heart stop with something that was pain and perfect music when pump returned with the rumkeg and the cheese and rolled them with a kick down the shelving sandy side of the hole he remembered with almost wrathful laughter that in the old days he had rolled down that slope himself and thought it a rather fine thing to do he felt then as if he were rolling down a smooth side of the matterhorn he observed now that the height was rather less than that of the second storey of one of the stunted cottages he had noted on his return he suddenly understood he had grown bigger bigger in a bodily sense he had doubts about any other the hole in heaven he said what a good name what a good poet i was in those days the hole in heaven but does it let one in or let one out in the last level shafts of the fallen sun the fantastic shadow of the longeared quadruped whom pump had now tethered to a new and nearer pasture fell across the last sunlit scrap of sand dalroy looked at the long exaggerated shadow of the ass and laughed that short explosive laugh he had uttered when the doors of the harems had been closed after the turkish war he was normally a man much too loquacious but he never explained those laughs humphrey pump plunged down again into the sunken nest and began to broach the cask of rum in his own secret style saying we can get something else somehow tomorrow for tonight we can eat cheese and drink rum especially as theres water on tap so to speak and now captain sing us the song against songs patrick dalroy drank a little rum out of a small medicine glass which the generally unaccountable mr pump unaccountably produced from his waistcoat pocket but patricks colour had risen his brow was almost as red as his hair and he was evidently reluctant i dont see why i should sing all the songs he said why the divil dont you sing a song yourself and now i come to think of it he cried with an accumulating brogue not perhaps wholly unaffected by the rum which he had not in fact drunk for years and now i come to think of it what about that song of yours all me youths coming back in this blest and cursed place and i remember that song of yours that never existed nor ever will dont ye remember now humphrey pump that night when i sang ye no less than seventeen songs of me own composition i remember it very well answered the englishman with restraint and dont ye remember went on the exhilarated irishman with solemnity that unless ye could produce a poetic lyric of your own written and sung by yourself i threatened to to sing again said the impenetrable pump yes i know he calmly proceeded to take out of his pockets which were alas more like those of a poacher than an innkeeper a folded and faded piece of paper i wrote it when you asked me he said simply i have never tried to sing it but ill sing it myself when youve sung your song against anybody singing at all all right cried the somewhat excited captain to hear a song from you why ill sing anything this is the song against songs hump and again he let his voice out like a bellow against the evening silence the song of the sorrow of melisande is a weary song and a dreary song the glory of marianas grange had got into great decay the song of the raven never more has never been called a cheery song and the brightest things in baudelaire are anything else but gay but who will write us a riding song or a hunting song or a drinking song fit for them that arose and rode when day and the wine were red but bring me a quart of claret out and i will write you a clinking song a song of war and a song of wine and a song to wake the dead the song of the fury of fragolette is a florid song and a torrid song the song of the sorrow of tara is sung to a harp unstrung the song of the cheerful shropshire kid i consider a perfectly horrid song and the song of the happy futurist is a song that cant be sung but who will write us a riding song or a fighting song or a drinking song fit for the fathers of you and me that knew how to think and thrive but the song of beauty and art and love is simply an utterly stinking song to double you up and drag you down and damn your soul alive take some more rum concluded the irish officer affably and lets hear your song at last with the gravity inseparable from the deep conventionality of country people mr pump unfolded the paper on which he had recorded the only antagonistic emotion that was strong enough in him to screw his infinite english tolerance to the pitch of song he read out the title very carefully and in full song against grocers by humphrey pump sole proprietor of the old ship pebblewick good accommodation for man and beast celebrated as the house at which both queen charlotte and jonathan wilde put up on different occasions and where the icecream man was mistaken for bonaparte this song is written against grocers god made the wicked grocer for a mystery and a sign that men might shun the awful shops and go to inns to dine where the bacons on the rafter and the wine is in the wood and god that made good laughter has seen that they are good the evilhearted grocer would call his mother maam and bow at her and bob at her her aged soul to damn and rub his horrid hands and ask what article was next though mortis in articulo should be her proper text his props are not his children but pert lads underpaid who call out cash and bang about to work his wicked trade he keeps a lady in a cage most cruelly all day and makes her count and calls her miss until she fades away the righteous minds of innkeepers induce them now and then to crack a bottle with a friend or treat unmoneyed men but who hath seen the grocer treat housemaids to his teas or crack a bottle of fishsauce or stand a man a cheese he sells us sands of araby as sugar for cash down he sweeps his shop and sells the dust the purest salt in town he crams with cans of poisoned meat poor subjects of the king and when they die by thousands why he laughs like anything the wicked grocer groces in spirits and in wine not frankly and in fellowship as men in inns do dine but packed with soap and sardines and carried off by grooms for to be snatched by duchesses and drunk in dressingrooms the hellinstructed grocer has a temple made of tin and the ruin of good innkeepers is loudly urged therein but now the sands are running out from sugar of a sort the grocer trembles for his time just like his weight is short captain dalroy was getting considerably heated with his nautical liquor and his appreciation of pumps song was not merely noisy but active he leapt to his feet and waved his glass ye ought to be poet laureate hump yere right yere right well stand all this no longer he dashed wildly up the sand slope and pointed with the signpost towards the darkening shore where the low shed of corrugated iron stood almost isolated theres your tin temple he said lets burn it they were some way along the coast from the large wateringplace of pebblewick and between the gathering twilight and the rolling country it could not be clearly seen nothing was now in sight but the corrugated iron hall by the beach and three halfbuilt red brick villas dalroy appeared to regard the hall and the empty houses with great malevolence look at it he said babylon he brandished the innsign in the air like a banner and began to stride towards the place showering curses in forty days he cried shall pebblewick be destroyed dogs shall lap the blood of j leveson secretary and unicorns come back pat cried humphrey youve had too much rum lions shall howl in its high places vociferated the captain donkeys will howl anyhow said pump but i suppose the other donkey must follow and loading and untethering the quadruped he began to lead him along chapter vii the society of simple souls under sunset at once softer and more sombre under which the leaden sea took on a lenten purple a tint appropriate to tragedy lady joan brett was once more drifting moodily along the seafront the evening had been rainy and lowering the wateringplace season was nearly over and she was almost alone on the shore but she had fallen into the habit of restlessly pacing the place and it seemed to satisfy some subconscious hunger in her rather mixed psychology through all her brooding her animal senses always remained abnormally active she could smell the sea when it had ebbed almost to the horizon and in the same way she heard through every whisper of waves or wind the swish or flutter of another womans skirt behind her there is she felt something unmistakable about the movements of a lady who is generally very dignified and rather slow and who happens to be in a hurry she turned to look at the lady who was thus hastening to overtake her lifted her eyebrows a little and held out her hand the interruption was known to her as lady enid wimpole cousin of lord ivywood a tall and graceful lady who unbalanced her own elegance by a fashionable costume that was at once funereal and fantastic her fair hair was pale but plentiful her face was not only handsome and fastidious in the aquiline style but when considered seriously was sensitive modest and even pathetic but her wan blue eyes seemed slightly prominent with that expression of cold eagerness that is seen in the eyes of ladies who ask questions at public meetings joan brett was herself as she had said a connection of the ivywood family but lady enid was ivywoods first cousin and for all practical purposes his sister for she kept house for him and his mother who was now so incredibly old that she only survived to satisfy conventional opinion in the character of a speechless and useless chaperon and ivywood was not the sort who would be likely to call out any activity in an old lady exercising that office nor for that matter was lady enid wimpole there seemed to shine on her face the same kind of inhuman absentminded common sense that shone on her cousins oh im so glad ive caught you up she said to joan lady ivywood wants you so much to come to us for the weekend or so while philip is still there he always admired your sonnet on cyprus so much and he wants to talk to you about this policy of his in turkey of course hes awfully busy but i shall be seeing him tonight after the meeting no living creature said lady joan with a smile ever saw him except before or after a meeting are you a simple soul asked lady enid carelessly am i a simple soul asked joan drawing her black brows together merciful heavens no what can you mean their meetings on tonight at the small universal hall and philips taking the chair explained the other lady hes very annoyed that he has to leave early to get up to the house but mr leveson can take the chair for the last bit theyve got misysra ammon got mrs who asked joan in honest doubt you make game of everything said lady enid in cheerless amiability its the man everyones talking about you know as well as i do its really his influence that has made the simple souls oh said lady joan brett then after a long silence she added who are the simple souls i should be interested in them if i could meet any and she turned her dark brooding face on the darkening purple sea do you mean to say my dear asked lady enid wimpole that you havent met any of them yet no said joan looking at the last dark line of sea i never met but one simple soul in my life but you must come to the meeting cried lady enid with frosty and sparkling gaiety you must come at once philip is certain to be eloquent on a subject like this and of course misysra ammon is always so wonderful without any very distinct idea of where she was going or why she was going there joan allowed herself to be piloted to a low lead or tin shed beyond the last straggling hotels out of the echoing shell of which she could prematurely hear a voice that she thought she recognised when she came in lord ivywood was on his feet in exquisite evening dress but with a light overcoat thrown over the seat behind him beside him in less tasteful but more obvious evening dress was the little old man she had heard on the beach no one else was on the platform but just under it rather to joans surprise sat miss browning her old typewriting friend in her old black dress industriously taking down lord ivywoods words in shorthand a yard or two off even more to her surprise sat miss brownings more domestic sister also taking down the same words in shorthand that is misysra ammon whispered lady enid earnestly pointing a delicate finger at the little old man beside the chairman i know him said joan wheres the umbrella at least evident lord ivywood was saying that one of those ancestral impossibilities is no longer impossible the east and the west are one the east is no longer east nor the west west for a small isthmus has been broken and the atlantic and pacific are a single sea no man assuredly has done more of this mighty work of unity than the brilliant and distinguished philosopher to whom you will have the pleasure of listening tonight and i profoundly wish that affairs more practical for i will not call them more important did not prevent my remaining to enjoy his eloquence as i have so often enjoyed it before mr leveson has kindly consented to take my place and i can do no more than express my deep sympathy with the aims and ideals which will be developed before you tonight i have long been increasingly convinced that underneath a certain mask of stiffness which the mahommedan religion has worn through certain centuries as a somewhat similar mask has been worn by the religion of the jews islam has in it the potentialities of being the most progressive of all religions so that a century or two to come we may see the cause of peace of science and of reform everywhere supported by islam as it is everywhere supported by israel not in vain i think is the symbol of that faith the crescent the growing thing while other creeds carry emblems implying more or less of finality for this great creed of hope its very imperfection is its pride and men shall walk fearlessly in new and wonderful paths following the increasing curve which contains and holds up before them the eternal promises of the orb it was characteristic of lord ivywood that though he was really in a hurry he sat down slowly and gravely amid the outburst of applause the quiet resumption of the speakers seat like the applause itself was an artistic part of the peroration when the last clap or stamp had subsided he sprang up alertly his light greatcoat over his arm shook hands with the lecturer bowed to the audience and slid quickly out of the hall mr leveson the swarthy young man with the drooping doubleeyeglass rather bashfully to the front took the empty seat on the platform and in a few words presented the eminent turkish mystic misysra ammon sometimes called the prophet of the moon lady joan found the prophets english accent somewhat improved by good society but he still elongated the letter u in the same bleating manner and his remarks had exactly the same rabidly wrongheaded ingenuity as his lecture upon english inns it appeared that he was speaking on the higher polygamy but he began with a sort of general defence of the moslem civilisation especially against the charge of sterility and worldly ineffectiveness it iss joost in the practical tings he was saying it iss joost in the practical tings if you could come to consider them in a manner quite equal that our methods are better than your methods my ancestors invented the curved swords because one cuts better with a curved sword your ancestors possessed the straight swords out of some romantic fancy of being what you call straight or i will take a more plain example of which i have myself experience when i first had the honour of meeting lord ivywood i was unused to your various ceremonies and had a little difficulty joost a little difficulty in entering mr claridges hotel where his lordship had invited me a servant of the hotel was standing joost beside me on the doorstep i stooooped down to take off my boooots and he asked me what i was dooing i said to him my friend i am taking off my boooots a smothered sound came from lady joan brett but the lecturer did not notice it and went on with a beautiful simplicity i told him that in my country when showing respect for any spot we do not take off our hats we take off our boooots and because i would keep on my hat and take off my boooots he suggested to me that i had been afflicted by allah in the head now was not that foony very said lady joan inside her handkerchief for she was choking with laughter something like a faint smile passed over the earnest faces of the two or three most intelligent of the simple souls but for the most part the souls seemed very simple indeed helpless looking people with limp hair and gowns like green curtains and their dry faces were as dry as ever but i explained to him i explained to him for a long time for a carefully occupied time that it was more practical more businesslike more altogether for utility to take off the boooots than to remove the hat let us i said to him consider what many complaints are made against the footwear what few complaints against the headwear you complain if in your drawingrooms is the marching about of muddy boooots are any of your drawingrooms marked thus with the marching about of muddy hats how very many of your husbands kick you with the boooot yet how few of your husbands on any occasion butt you with the hat he looked round with a radiant seriousness which made lady joan almost as speechless for sympathy as she was for amusement with all that was most sound in his too complicated soul she realised the presence of a man really convinced the man on the doorstep he would not listen to me went on misysra ammon pathetically he said there would be a crowd if i stood on the doorstep holding in my hand my boooots well i do not know why in your country you always send the young males to be the first of your crowds they certainly were making a number of noises the young males lady joan brett stood up suddenly and displayed enormous interest in the rest of the audience in the back parts of the hall she felt that if she looked for one moment more at the serious face with the jewish nose and the persian beard she would publicly disgrace herself or what was quite as bad for she was the generous sort of aristocrat publicly insult the lecturer she had a feeling that the sight of all the simple souls in bulk might have a soothing effect it had it had what might have been mistaken for a depressing effect lady joan resumed her seat with a controlled countenance now why asked the eastern philosopher do i tell so simple a little story of your london streets a thing happening any day the little mistake had no prejuudicial effect lord ivywood came out at the end he made no attempt to explain the true view of so important matters to mr claridges servant though mr claridges servant remained on the doorstep but he commanded mr claridges servant to restore to me one of my boooots which had fallen down the front steps while i was explaining this harmlessness of the hat in the home so all was for me very well but why do i tell such little tales he spread out his hands again in his fanlike eastern style then he clapped them together so suddenly that joan jumped and looked instinctively for the entrance of five hundred negro slaves laden with jewels but it was only his emphatic gesture of eloquence he went on with an excited thickening of the accent because my friends this is the best example i could give of the wrong and slanderous character of the charge that we fail in our domesticities that we fail especially in our treatment of the womankind i appeal to any lady to any christian lady is not the boooot more devastating more dreaded in the home than the hat the boot jumps he bound he run about he break things he leave on the carpet the earths of the garden the hat he remain quiet on his hatpeg look at him on his hatpeg how quiet and good he remain why not let him remain quiet also on his head lady joan applauded warmly as did several other ladies and the sage went on encouraged can you not therefore trust dear ladies this great religion to understand you concerning other things as it understands you regarding boooots what is the common objection our worthy enemies make against our polygamy that it is disdainful of the womanhood but how can this be so my friends when it allows the womanhood to be present in so large numbers when in your house of commons you put a hundred english members and joost one little welsh member you do not say the welshman is on top he is our sultan may he live for ever if your jury contained eleven great large ladies and one leetle man you would not say this is unfair to the great large ladies why should you shrink then ladies from this great polygamical experiment which lord ivywood himself joans dark eyes were still fixed on the wrinkled patient face of the lecturer but every word of the rest of the lecture was lost to her under her glowing spanish tint she had turned pale with extraordinary emotions but she did not stir a hair the door of the hall stood open and occasional sounds came even from that deserted end of the town two men seemed to be passing along the distant parade one of them was singing it was common enough for workmen to sing going home at night and the voice though a loud one would have been too far off for joan to hear the words only joan happened to know the words she could almost see them before her written in a round swaggering hand on the pink page of an old schoolgirl album at home she knew the words and the voice i come from castlepatrick and my heart is on my sleeve and any sword or pistol boy can hit ut with me leave it shines there for an epaulette as golden as a flame as naked as me ancestors as noble as me name for i come from castlepatrick and my heart is on my sleeve but a lady stole it from me on st gallowglasss eve startlingly and with strong pain there sprang up before joans eyes a patch of broken heath with a very deep hollow of white sand blinding in the sun no words no name only the place the folks that live in liverpool their heart is in their boots they go to hell like lambs they do because the hooter hoots where men may not be dancin though the wheels may dance all day and men may not be smokin but only chimneys may but i come from castlepatrick and my heart is on my sleeve but a lady stole it from me on st poleyanders eve the folks that live in black belfast their heart is in their mouth they see us making murders in the meadows of the south they think a ploughs a rack they do and cattlecalls are creeds and they think were burnin witches when were only burnin weeds but i come from castlepatrick and me heart is on me sleeve but a lady stole it from me on st barnabass eve the voice had stopped suddenly but the last lines were so much more distinct that it was certain the singer had come nearer and was not marching away it was only after all this and through a sort of cloud that lady joan heard the indomitable oriental bringing his whole eloquent address to a conclusion and if you do not refuuse the sun that returns and rises in the east with every morning you will not refuuse either this great social experiment this great polygamical method which also arose out of the east and always returns for this is that higher polygamy which always comes like the sun itself out of the orient but is only at its noontide splendour when the sun is high in heaven she was but vaguely conscious of mr leveson the man with the dark face and the eyeglasses acknowledging the entrancing lecture in suitable terms and calling on any of the simple souls who might have questions to ask to ask them it was only when the simple souls had displayed their simplicity with the usual parade of wellbred reluctance and fussy selfeffacement that anyone addressed the chair and it was only after somebody had been addressing the chair for some time that joan gradually awoke to the fact that the address was somewhat unusual chapter viii vox populi vox dei i am sure mr leveson the secretary had said with a somewhat constrained smile that after the eloquent and epochmaking speech to which we have listened there will be some questions asked and we hope to have a debate afterwards i am sure somebody will ask a question then he looked interrogatively at one weary looking gentleman in the fourth row and said mr hinch mr hinch shook his head with a pallid passion of refusal wonderful to watch and said i couldnt i really couldnt we should be very pleased said mr leveson if any lady would ask a question in the silence that followed it was somehow psychologically borne in on the whole audience that one particular great large lady as the lecturer would say sitting at the end of the second row was expected to ask a question her own waxwork immobility was witness both to the expectation and its disappointment are there any other questions asked mr leveson as if there had been any yet he seemed to speak with a slight air of relief there was a sort of stir at the back of the hall and half way down one side of it choked whispers could be heard of now then garge go it garge is there any questions gor mr leveson looked up with an alertness somewhat akin to alarm he realised for the first time that a few quite common men in coarse unclean clothes had somehow strolled in through the open door they were not true rustics but the semirustic labourers that linger about the limits of the large wateringplaces there was no mr among them there was a general tendency to call everybody george mr leveson saw the situation and yielded to it he modelled himself on lord ivywood and did much what he would have done in all cases but with a timidity lord ivywood would not have shown and the same social training that made him ashamed to be with such men made him ashamed to own his shame the same modern spirit that taught him to loathe such rags also taught him to lie about his loathing i am sure we should be very glad he said nervously if any friends from outside care to join in our inquiry of course were all democrats and he looked round at the grand ladies with a ghastly smile and believe in the voice of the people and so on if our friend at the back of the hall will put his question briefly we need not insist i think on his putting it in writing there were renewed hoarse encouragements to george that rightly christened champion and he wavered forward on legs tied in the middle with string he did not appear to have had any seat since his arrival and made his remarks standing half way down what we may call the central aisle well i want to ask the proprietor he began questions said mr leveson swiftly seizing a chance for that construction of debate which is the main business of a modern chairman must be asked of the chair if they are points of order if they concern the address they should be asked of the lecturer well i ask the lecturer said the patient garge whether it aint right that when you ave the thing outside you should ave the thing inside hoarse applause at the back mr leveson was evidently puzzled and already suspicious that something was quite wrong but the enthusiasm of the prophet of the moon sprang up instantly at any sort of question and swept the chairman along with it but it iss the essence of our whoole message he cried spreading out his arms to embrace the world that the outer manifestation should be one with the inner manifestation my friendss it iss this very truuth our friend has stated that iss responsible for our apparent lack of symbolism in islam we appear to neglect the symbol because we insist on the satisfactory symbol my friend in the middle will walk round all our mosques and say loudly where is the statue of allah but can my friend in the middle really execute a complete and generally approved statue of allah misysra ammon sat down greatly satisfied with his answer but it was doubted by many whether he had conveyed the satisfaction to his friend in the middle that seeker after truth wiped his mouth with the back of his hand with an unsatisfied air and said no offence sir but aint it the law sir that if you ave that outside were all right i came in ere as natural as could be but gorlumme i never see a place like this afore hoarse laughter behind no apology is needed my friend cried the eastern sage eagerly i can conceive you are not perhaps duuly conversant with such schools of truth but the law is all the law is allah the inmost uunity of well aint it the law repeated the dogged george and every time he mentioned the law the poor men who are its chief victims applauded loudly im not one to make a fuss i never was one to make a fuss im a lawabidin man i am more applause aint it the law that if so be such is your sign and such is your profession you ought to serve us i fear i not quite follow cried the eager turk i ought to serve us shouted a throng of thick voices from the back of the hall which was already much more crowded than before serve you cried misysra leaping up like a spring released the holy prophet came from heaven to serve you the virtue and valour of a thousand years my friends has had no hunger but to serve you we are of all faiths the most the faith of service our highest prophet is no more than the servant of god as i am as you all are even for our symbol we choose a satellite and honour the moon because it only serves the earth and does not pretend to be the sun im sure cried mr leveson jumping up with a tactful grin that the lecturer has answered this last point in a most eloquent and effective way and the motor cars are waiting for some of the ladies who have come from some distance and i really think the proceedings all the artistic ladies were already getting on their wraps with faces varying from bewilderment to blank terror only lady joan lingered trembling with unexplained excitement the hitherto speechless hinch had slid up to the chairmans seat and whispered to him you must get all the ladies away i cant imagine whats up but somethings up well repeated the patient george so be its the law where is it ladies and gentlemen said mr leveson in his most ingratiating manner i think we have had a most delightful evening and no we aint cried a new and nastier voice from a corner of the room where is it thats what we got a right to know said the lawabiding george where is it where is what cried the nearly demented secretary in the chair what do you want the lawabiding mr george made a half turn and a gesture towards the man in the corner and said whats yours jim ill ave a drop of scotch said the man in the corner lady enid wimpole who had lingered a little in loyalty to joan the only other lady still left caught both her wrists and cried in a thrilling whisper oh we must go to the car dear theyre using the most awful language away on the wettest edge of the sands by the sea the prints of two wheels and four hoofs were being slowly washed away by a slowly rising tide which was indeed the only motive of the man humphrey pump leading the donkey cart in leading it almost ankle deep in water i hope youre sober again now he said with some seriousness to his companion a huge man walking heavily and even humbly with a straight sword swinging to and fro at his hip for honestly it was a mugs game to go and stick up the old sign before that tin place i havent often spoken to you like this captain but i dont believe any other man in the county could get you out of the hole as i can but to go down there and frighten the ladies why theres been nothing so silly here since bishops folly you could hear the ladies screaming before we left i heard worse than that long before we left said the large man without lifting his head i heard one of them laugh christ do you think i shouldnt hear her laugh there was a silence i didnt mean to speak sharp said humphrey pump with that incorruptible kindliness which was the root of his englishry and may yet save the soul of the english but its the truth i was pretty well bothered about how to get out of this business youre braver than i am you see and i own i was frightened about both of us if i hadnt known my way to the lost tunnel i should be fairly frightened still known your way to what asked the captain lifting his red head for the first time oh you know all about no more ivywoods lost tunnel said pump carelessly why we all used to look for it when we were boys only i happened to find it have mercy on an exile said dalroy humbly i dont know which hurt him most the things he forgets or the things he remembers mr pump was silent for a little while and then said more seriously than usual well the people from london say you must put up placards and statues and subscriptions and epitaphs and the lord knows what to the people whove found some new trick and made it come off but only a man that knows his own land for forty miles round knows what a lot of people and clever people too there were who found new tricks and had to hide them because they didnt come off there was dr boone up by gillinhugby who held out against dr collison and the vaccination his treatment saved sixty patients who had got smallpox and dr collisons killed ninetytwo patients who hadnt got anything but boone had to keep it dark naturally because all his lady patients grew mustaches it was a result of the treatment but it wasnt a result he wishes to dwell on then there was old dean arthur who discovered balloons if ever a man did he discovered them long before they were discovered but people were suspicious about such things just then there was a revival of the witch business in spite of all the parsons and he had to sign a paper saying where hed got the notion well it stands to reason you wouldnt like to sign a paper saying youd got it from the village idiot when you were both blowing soapbubbles and thats all he could have signed for he was an honest gentleman the poor old dean then there was jack arlingham and the diving bell but you remember all about that well it was just the same with the man that made this tunnel one of the mad ivywoods theres many a man captain that has a statue in the great london squares for helping to make the railway trains theres many a man has his name in westminster abbey for doing something in discovering steamboats poor old ivywood discovered both at once and had to be put under control he had a notion that a railway train might be made to rush right into the sea and turn into a steamboat and it seemed all right according as he worked it out but his family were so ashamed of the thing that they didnt like the tunnel even mentioned i dont think anybody knows where it is but me and bunchy robinson we shall be there in a minute or two theyve thrown the rocks about at this end and let the thick plantation grow at the other but ive got a race horse through before now to save it from colonel chepstows little games and i think i can manage this donkey honestly i think its the only place well be safe in after what weve left behind us at pebblewick but its the best place in the world theres no doubt for lying low and starting afresh here we are you think you cant get behind that rock but you can in fact you have dalroy found himself with some bewilderment round the corner of a rock and in a long bore or barrel of blackness that ended in a very dim spot of green hearing the hoofs of the ass and the feet of his friend behind him he turned his head but could see nothing but the pitch darkness of a closed coal cellar he turned again to the dim green speck and marching forward was glad to see it grow larger and brighter like a big emerald till he came out on a throng of trees mostly thin but growing so thickly and so close to the cavernous entrance of the tunnel that it was quite clear the place was meant to be choked up by forests and forgotten the light that came glimmering through the trees was so broken and tremulous that it was hard to tell whether it was daybreak or moonrise i know theres water here said pump they couldnt keep it out of the stonework when they made the tunnel and old ivywood hit the hydraulic engineer with a spirit level with the bit of covert here and the sea behind us we ought to be able to get food of one kind or another when the cheese has given out and donkeys can eat anything by the way he added with some embarrassment you dont mind my saying it captain but i think wed better keep that rum for rare occasions its the best rum in england and may be the last if these mad games are going on itll do us good to feel its there so we can have it when we want it the casks still nearly full dalroy put out his hand and shook the others hump he said seriously youre right its a sacred trust for humanity and well only drink it ourselves to celebrate great victories in token of which i will take a glass now to celebrate our glorious victory over leveson and his tin tabernacle he drained one glass and then sat down on the cask as if to put temptation behind him his blue ruminant bulls eye seemed to plunge deeper and deeper into the emerald twilight of the trees in front of him and it was long before he spoke again at last he observed i think you said hump that a friend of yours a gentleman named bunchy robinson i think was also a habitu here yes he knew the way answered pump leading the donkey to the most suitable patch of pasturage may we do you think have the pleasure of a visit from mr robinson inquired the captain not unless theyre jolly careless up in blackstone gaol replied pump and he moved the cheese well into the arch of the tunnel dalroy still sat with his square chin on his hand staring at the mystery of the little wood you seem absentminded captain remarked humphrey the deepest thoughts are all commonplaces said dalroy that is why i believe in democracy which is more than you do you foul bloodstained old british tory and the deepest commonplace of all is that vanitas vanitatem which is not pessimism but is really the opposite of pessimism it is mans futility that makes us feel he must be a god and i think of this tunnel and how the poor old lunatic walked about on this grass watching it being built the soul in him on fire with the future and he saw the whole world changed and the seas thronged with his new shipping and now and dalroys voice changed and broke now there is good pasture for the donkey and it is very quiet here yes said pump in some way that conveyed his knowledge that the captain was thinking of other things also the captain went on dreamily and i think about another lord ivywood recorded in history who also had a great vision for it is a great vision after all and though the man is a prig he is brave he also wants to drive a tunnel between east and west to make the indian empire more british to effect what he calls the orientation of england and i call the ruin of christendom and i am wondering just now whether the clear intellect and courageous will of a madman will be strong enough to burst and drive that tunnel as everything seems to show at this moment that it will or whether there be indeed enough life and growth in your england to leave it at last as this is left buried in english forests and wasted by an english sea the silence fell between them again and again there was only the slight sound the animal made in eating as dalroy had said it was very quiet there but it was not quiet in pebblewick that night when the riot act was read and all the people who had seen the signboard outside fought all the people who hadnt seen the signboard outside or when babies and scientists next morning seeking for shells and other common objects of the seashore found that their study included fragments of the outer clothing of leveson and scraps of corrugated iron chapter ix the higher criticism and mr hibbs pebblewick boasted an enterprising evening paper of its own called the pebblewick globe and it was the great vaunt of the editors life that he had got out an edition announcing the mystery of the vanishing signboard almost simultaneously with its vanishing in the rows that followed sandwich men found no little protection from the blows indiscriminately given them behind and before in the large wooden boards they carried inscribed the vanishing pub pebblewicks fairy tale special and the paper contained a categorical and mainly correct account of what had happened or what seemed to have happened to the eyes of the amazed garge and his crowd of sympathisers george burn carpenter of this town with samuel gripes drayman in the service of messrs jay and gubbins brewers together with a number of other wellknown residents passed by the new building erected on the west beach for various forms of entertainment and popularly called the small universal hall seeing outside it one of the old innsigns now so rare they drew the quite proper inference that the place retained the license to sell alcoholic liquors which so many other places in this neighbourhood have recently lost the persons inside however appear to have denied all knowledge of the fact and when the party after some regrettable scenes in which no life was lost came out on the beach again it was found that the innsign had been destroyed or stolen all parties were quite sober and had indeed obtained no opportunity to be anything else the mystery is underlying inquiry but this comparatively realistic record was local and spontaneous and owed not a little to the accidental honesty of the editor moreover evening papers are often more honest than morning papers because they are written by illpaid and hardworked underlings in a great hurry and there is no time for more timid people to correct them by the time the morning papers came out next day a faint but perceptible change had passed over the story of the vanishing signboard in the daily paper which had the largest circulation and the most influence in that part of the world the problem was committed to a gentleman known by what seemed to the nonjournalistic world the singular name of hibbs however it had been affixed to him in jest in connection with the almost complicated caution with which all his public criticisms were qualified at every turn so that everything came to depend upon the conjunctions upon but and yet and though and similar words as his salary grew larger for editors and proprietors like that sort of thing and his old friends fewer for the most generous of friends cannot but feel faintly acid at a success which has in it nothing of the infectious flavour of glory he grew more and more to value himself as a diplomatist a man who always said the right thing but he was not without his intellectual nemesis for at last he became so very diplomatic as to be darkly and densely unintelligible people who knew him had no difficulty in believing that what he had said was the right thing the tactful thing the thing that should save the situation but they had great difficulty in discovering what it was in his early days he had had a great talent for one of the worst tricks of modern journalism the trick of dismissing the important part of a question as if it could wait and appearing to get to business on the unimportant part of it thus he would say whatever we may think of the rights and wrongs of the vivisection of pauper children we shall all agree that it should only be done in any event by fully qualified practitioners but in the later and darker days of his diplomacy he seemed rather to dismiss the important part of a subject and get to grips with some totally different subject following some timid and elusive train of associations of his own in his late bad manner as they say of painters he was just as likely to say whatever we may think of the rights and wrongs of the vivisection of pauper children no progressive mind can doubt that the influence of the vatican is on the decline his nickname had stuck to him in honour of a paragraph he was alleged to have written when the american president was wounded by a bullet fired by a lunatic in new orleans and which was said to have run the president passed a good night and his condition is greatly improved the assassin is not however a german as was at first supposed men stared at that mysterious conjunction till they wanted to go mad and to shoot somebody themselves hibbs however was a long lank man with straight yellowish hair and a manner that was externally soft and mild but secretly supercilious he had been when at cambridge a friend of leveson and they had both prided themselves on being moderate politicians but if you have had your hat smashed over your nose by one who has very recently described himself as a lawabidin man and if you have had to run for your life with one coattail and encouraged to further bodily activity by having irregular pieces of a corrugated iron roof thrown after you by men more energetic than yourself you will find you emerge with emotions which are not solely those of a moderate politician hibbs however had already composed a leaderette on the pebblewick incident which rather pointed to the truth of the story so far as his articles ever pointed to anything his motives for veering vaguely in this direction were as usual complex he knew the millionaire who owned the paper had a hobby of spiritualism and something might always come out of not suppressing a marvellous story he knew that two at least of the prosperous artisans or small tradesmen who had attested the tale were staunch supporters of the party he knew that lord ivywood must be mildly but not effectually checked for lord ivywood was of the other party and there could be no milder or less effectual way of checking him than by allowing the paper to lend at least a temporary credit to a wellsupported story that came from outside and certainly had not been like so many stories created in the office amid all these considerations had hibbs however steered his way to a more or less confirmatory article when the sudden apparition of j leveson secretary in the subeditors room with a burst collar and broken eyeglasses led mr hibbs into a long private conversation with him and a comparative reversal of his plans but of course he did not write a new article he was not of that divine order who make all things new he chopped and changed his original article in such a way that it was something quite beyond the most bewildering article he had written in the past and is still prized by those highly cultured persons who collect the worst literature of the world it began indeed with the comparatively familiar formula whether we take the more lax or the more advanced view of the old disputed problem of the morality or immorality of the wooden signboard as such we shall all agree that the scenes enacted at pebblewick were very discreditable to most though not all concerned after that tact degenerated into a riot of irrelevance it was a wonderful article the reader could get from it a faint glimpse of mr hibbss opinion on almost every other subject except the subject of the article the first half of the next sentence made it quite clear that mr hibbs had he been present would not have lent his active assistance to the massacre of st bartholomew or the massacres of september but the second half of the sentence suggested with equal clearness that since these two acts were no longer as it were in contemplation and all attempts to prevent them would probably arrive a little late he felt the warmest friendship for the french nation he merely insisted that his friendship should never be mentioned except in the french language it must be called an entente in the language taught to tourists by waiters it must on no account be called an understanding in a language understanded of the people from the first half of the sentence following it might safely be inferred that mr hibbs had read milton or at least the passage about sons of belial from the second half that he knew nothing about bad wine let alone good the next sentence began with the corruption of the roman empire and contrived to end with dr clifford then there was a weak plea for eugenics and a warm plea against conscription which was not true eugenics that was all and it was headed the riot at pebblewick yet some injustice would be done to hibbs however if we concealed the fact that this chaotic leader was followed by quite a considerable mass of public correspondence the people who write to newspapers are it may be supposed a small eccentric body like most of those that sway a modern state but at least unlike the lawyers or the financiers or the members of parliament or the men of science they are people of all kinds scattered all over the country of all classes counties ages sects sexes and stages of insanity the letters that followed hibbss article are still worth looking up in the dusty old files of his paper a dear old lady in the densest part of the midlands wrote to suggest that there might really have been an old ship wrecked on the shore during the proceedings mr leveson may have omitted to notice it or at that late hour of the evening it may have been mistaken for a signboard especially by a person of defective sight my own sight has been failing for some time but i am still a diligent reader of your paper if mr hibbss diplomacy had left one nerve in his soul undrugged he would have laughed or burst into tears or got drunk or gone into a monastery over a letter like that as it was he measured it with a pencil and decided that it was just too long to get into the column then there was a letter from a theorist and a theorist of the worst sort there is no great harm in the theorist who makes up a new theory to fit a new event but the theorist who starts with a false theory and then sees everything as making it come true is the most dangerous enemy of human reason the letter began like a bullet let loose by the trigger is not the whole question met by ex iv i enclose pamphlets in which i have proved the point quite plainly and which none of the bishops or the socalled free church ministers have attempted to answer the connection between the rod or pole and the snake so clearly indicated in scripture is no less clear in this case it is well known that those who follow after strong drink often announce themselves as having seen a snake is it not clear that those unhappy revellers beheld it in its transformed state as a pole see also deut xviii if our socalled religious leaders etc the letter went on for thirtythree pages and hibbs was perhaps justified in this case in thinking the letter rather too long then there was the scientific correspondent who said might it not be due to the acoustic qualities of the hall he had never believed in the corrugated iron hall the very word hall itself he added playfully was often so sharpened and shortened by the abrupt echoes of those repeated metallic curves that it had every appearance of being the word hell and had caused many theological entanglements and some police prosecutions in the light of these facts he wished to draw the editors attention to some very curious details about this supposed presence or absence of an innsign it would be noted that many of the witnesses and especially the most respectable of them constantly refer to something that is supposed to be outside the word outside occurs at least five times in the depositions of the complaining persons surely by all scientific analogy we may infer that the unusual phrase innsign is an acoustic error for inside the word inside would so naturally occur in any discussion either about the building or the individual when the debate was of a hygienic character this letter was signed medical student and the less intelligent parts of it were selected for publication in the paper then there was a really humorous man who wrote and said there was nothing at all inexplicable or unusual about the case he himself he said had often seen a signboard outside a pub when he went into it and been quite unable to see it when he came out this letter the only one that had any quality of literature was sternly set aside by mr hibbs then came a cultured gentleman with a light touch who merely made a suggestion had anyone read h g wellss story about the kink in space he contrived indescribably to suggest that no one had even heard of it except himself or perhaps of mr wells either the story indicated that mens feet might be in one part of the world and their eyes in another he offered the suggestion for what it was worth the particular pile of letters on which hibbs however threw it showed only too clearly what it was worth then there was a man of course who called it all a plot of frenzied foreigners against britains shore but as he did not make it quite clear whether the chief wickedness of these aliens had lain in sticking the sign up or in pulling it down his remarks the remainder of which referred exclusively to the conversational misconduct of an italian icecream man whose side of the case seemed insufficiently represented carried the less weight and then last but the reverse of least there plunged in all the people who think they can solve a problem they cannot understand by abolishing everything that has contributed to it we all know these people if a barber has cut his customers throat because the girl has changed her partner for a dance or donkey ride on hampstead heath there are always people to protest against the mere institutions that led up to it this would not have happened if barbers were abolished or if cutlery were abolished or if the objection felt by girls to imperfectly grown beards were abolished or if the girls were abolished or if heaths and open spaces were abolished or if dancing were abolished or if donkeys were abolished but donkeys i fear will never be abolished there were plenty of such donkeys in the common land of this particular controversy some made it an argument against democracy because poor garge was a carpenter some made it an argument against alien immigration because misysra ammon was a turk some proposed that ladies should no longer be admitted to any lectures anywhere because they had constituted a slight and temporary difficulty at this one without the faintest fault of their own some urged that all holiday resorts should be abolished some urged that all holidays should be abolished some vaguely denounced the seaside some still more vaguely proposed to remove the sea all said that if this or that stones or seaweed or strange visitors or bad weather or bathing machines were swept away with a strong hand this which had happened would not have happened they only had one slight weakness all of them that they did not seem to have the faintest notion of what had happened and in this they were not inexcusable nobody did know what had happened nobody knows it to this day of course or it would be unnecessary to write this story no one can suppose this story is written from any motive save that of telling the plain humdrum truth that queer confused cunning which was the only definable quality possessed by hibbs however had certainly scored a victory so far for the tone of the weekly papers followed him with more intelligence and less trepidation but they followed him it seemed more and more clear that some kind of light and sceptical explanation was to be given of the whole business and that the whole business was to be dropped the story of the signboard and the ethical chapel of corrugated iron was discussed and somewhat disparaged in all the more serious and especially in the religious weeklies though the low church papers seemed to reserve their distaste chiefly for the signboard and the high church papers chiefly for the chapel all agreed that the combination was incongruous and most treated it as fabulous the only intellectual organs which seemed to think it might have happened were the spiritualist papers and their interpretation had not that solidity which would have satisfied mr george it was not until almost a year after that it was felt in philosophical circles that the last word had been said on the matter an estimate of the incident and of its bearing on natural and supernatural history occurred in professor widges celebrated historicity of the petropiscatorial phenomena which so profoundly affected modern thought when it came out in parts in the hibbert journal everyone remembers professor widges main contention that the modern critic must apply to the thaumaturgics of the lake of tiberias the same principle of criticism which dr bunk and others have so successfully applied to the thaumaturgics of the cana narrative authorities as final as pink and toscher wrote the professor have now shown with an emphasis that no emancipated mind is entitled to question that the aquavinic thaumaturgy at cana is wholly inconsistent with the psychology of the master of the feast as modern research has analysed it and indeed with the whole judaeoaramaic psychology at that stage of its development as well as being painfully incongruous with the elevated ideals of the ethical teacher in question but as we rise to higher levels of moral achievement it will probably be found necessary to apply the canaic principle to other and later events in the narrative this principle has of course been mainly expounded by huscher in the sense that the whole episode is unhistorical while the alternative theory that the wine was nonalcoholic and was naturally infused into the water can claim on its side the impressive name of minns it is clear that if we apply the same alternative to the socalled miraculous draught of fishes we must either hold with gilp that the fishes were stuffed representations of fishes artificially placed in the lake see the rev y wyses christovegetarianism as a worldsystem where this position is forcibly set forth or we must on the huscherian hypothesis deprive the piscatorial narrative of all claim to historicity whatever the difficulty felt by the most daring critics even pooke in adopting this entirely destructive attitude is the alleged improbability of so detailed a narrative being founded on so slight a phrase as the antihistorical critics refer it to it is urged by pooke with characteristic relentless reasoning that according to huschers theory a metaphorical but at least noticeable remark such as i will make you fishers of men was expanded into a realistic chronicle of events which contains no mention even in the passages evidently interpolated of any men actually found in the nets when they were hauled up out of the sea or more properly lagoon it must appear presumptuous or even bad taste for anyone in the modern world to differ on any subject from pooke but i would venture to suggest that the very academic splendour and unique standing of the venerable professor whose ninetyseventh birthday was so beautifully celebrated in chicago last year may have forbidden him all but intuitive knowledge of how errors arise among the vulgar i crave pardon for mentioning a modern case known to myself not indeed by personal presence but by careful study of all the reports which presents a curious parallel to such ancient expansions of a text into an incident in accordance with huschers law it occurred at pebblewick in the south of england the town had long been in a state of dangerous religious excitement the great religious genius who has since so much altered our whole attitude to the religions of the world misysra ammon had been lecturing on the sands to thousands of enthusiastic hearers their meetings were often interrupted both by childrens services run on the most ruthless lines of orthodoxy and by the league of the red rosette the formidable atheist and anarchist organization as if this were not enough to swell the whirlpool of fanaticism the old popular controversy between the milnian and the complete sublapsarians broke out again on the fated beach it is natural to conjecture that in the thickening atmosphere of theology in pebblewick some controversialist quoted the text an evil and adulterous generation seek for a sign but no sign shall be given it save the sign of the prophet jonas a mind like that of pooke will find it hard to credit but it seems certain that the effect of this text on the ignorant peasantry of southern england was actually to make them go about looking for a sign in the sense of those old tavern signs now so happily disappearing the sign of the prophet jonas they somehow translated in their stunted minds into a signboard of the ship out of which jonah was thrown they went about literally looking for the sign of the ship and there are some cases of their suffering smails hallucination and actually seeing it the whole incident is a curious parallel to the gospel narrative and a triumphant vindication of huschers law lord ivywood paid a public compliment to professor widge saying that he had rolled back from his country what might have been an ocean of superstitions but indeed poor hibbs had struck the first and stunning blow that scattered the brains of all men chapter x the character of quoodle there lay about in lord ivywoods numerous gardens terraces outhouses stable yards and similar places a dog that came to be called by the name of quoodle lord ivywood did not call him quoodle lord ivywood was almost physically incapable of articulating such sounds lord ivywood did not care for dogs he cared for the cause of dogs of course and he cared still more for his own intellectual selfrespect and consistency he would never have permitted a dog in his house to be physically illtreated nor for that matter a rat nor for that matter even a man but if quoodle was not physically illtreated he was at least socially neglected and quoodle did not like it for dogs care for companionship more than for kindness itself lord ivywood would probably have sold the dog but he consulted experts as he did on everything he didnt understand and many things that he did and the impression he gathered from them was that the dog technically considered would fetch very little mostly it seemed because of the mixture of qualities that it possessed it was a sort of mongrel bullterrier but with rather too much of the bulldog and this fact seemed to weaken its price as much as it strengthened its jaw his lordship also gained a hazy impression that the dog might have been valuable as a watchdog if it had not been able to follow game like a pointer and that even in the latter walk of life it would always be discredited by an unfortunate talent for swimming as well as a retriever but lord ivywoods impressions may very well have been slightly confused as he was probably thinking about the black stone of mecca or some such subject at the moment the victim of this entanglement of virtues therefore still lay about in the sunlight of ivywood exhibiting no general result of that entanglement except the most appalling ugliness now lady joan brett did appreciate dogs it was the whole of her type and a great deal of her tragedy that all that was natural in her was still alive under all that was artificial and she could smell hawthorn or the sea as far off as a dog can smell his dinner like most aristocrats she would carry cynicism almost to the suburbs of the city of satan she was quite as irreligious as lord ivywood or rather more she could be quite equally frigid or supercilious when she felt inclined and in the great social talent of being tired she could beat him any day of the week but the difference remained in spite of her sophistries and ambitions that her elemental communications were not cut and his were for her the sunrise was still the rising of a sun and not the turning on of a light by a convenient cosmic servant for her the spring was really the season in the country and not merely the season in town for her cocks and hens were natural appendages to an english house and not as lord ivywood had proved to her from an encyclopaedia animals of indian origin recently imported by alexander the great and so for her a dog was a dog and not one of the higher animals nor one of the lower animals nor something that had the sacredness of life nor something that ought to be muzzled nor something that ought not to be vivisected she knew that in every practical sense proper provision would be made for the dog as indeed provision was made for the yellow dogs in constantinople by abdul hamid whose life lord ivywood was writing for the progressive potentates series nor was she in the least sentimental about the dog or anxious to turn him into a pet it simply came natural to her in passing to rub all his hair the wrong way and call him something which she instantly forgot the man who was mowing the garden lawn looked up for a moment for he had never seen the dog behave in exactly that way before quoodle arose shook himself and trotted on in front of the lady leading her up an iron side staircase of which as it happened she had never made use before it was then most probably that she first took any special notice of him and her pleasure like that which she took in the sublime prophet from turkey was of a humorous character for the complex quadruped had retained the bow legs of the bulldog and seen from behind reminded her ridiculously of a swaggering little major waddling down to his club the dog and the iron stairway between them led her into a series of long rooms one opening into the other they formed part of what she had known in earlier days as the disused wing of ivywood house which had been neglected or shut up probably because it bore some defacements from the fancies of the mad ancestor the memory of whom the present lord ivywood did not think helpful to his own political career but it seemed to joan that there were indications of a recent attempt to rehabilitate the place there was a pail of whitewash in one of the empty rooms a stepladder in another here and there a curtain rod and at last in the fourth room a curtain it hung all alone on the old woodwork but it was a very gorgeous curtain being a kind of orangegold relieved with wavy bars of crimson which somehow seemed to suggest the very spirit and presence of serpents though they had neither eyes nor mouths among them in the next of the endless series of rooms she came upon a kind of ottoman striped with green and silver standing alone on the bare floor she sat down on it from a mixed motive of fatigue and of impudence for she dimly remembered a story which she had always thought one of the funniest in the world about a lady only partly initiated in theosophy who had been in the habit of resting on a similar object only to discover afterward that it was a mahatma covered with his eastern garment and prostrate and rigid in ecstasy she had no hopes of sitting on a mahatma herself but the very thought of it made her laugh because it would make lord ivywood look such a fool she was not sure whether she liked or disliked lord ivywood but she felt quite certain that it would gratify her to make him look a fool the moment she had sat down on the ottoman the dog who had been trotting beside her sat down also and on the edge of her skirt after a minute or two she rose and the dog rose and she looked yet farther down that long perspective of large rooms in which men like philip ivywood forget that they are only men the next was more ornate and the next yet more so it was plain that the scheme of decoration that was in progress had been started at the other end she could now see that the long lane ended in rooms that from afar off looked like the end of a kaleidoscope rooms like nests made only from humming birds or palaces built of fixed fireworks out of this furnace of fragmentary colours she saw ivywood advancing toward her with his black suit and his white face accented by the contrast his lips were moving for he was talking to himself as many orators do he did not seem to see her and she had to strangle a subconscious and utterly senseless cry he is blind the next moment he was welcoming her intrusion with the wellbred surprise and rather worldly simplicity suitable to such a case and joan fancied she understood why his face had seemed a little bleaker and blinder than usual it was by contrast he was carrying clutched to his forefinger as his ancestors might have carried a falcon clutched to the wrist a small bright coloured semitropical bird the expression of whose head neck and eye was the very opposite of his own joan thought she had never seen a living creature with a head so lively and insulting its provocative eye and pointed crest seemed to be offering to fight fifty gamecocks it was no wonder she told herself that by the side of this gaudy guttersnipe with feathers ivywoods faintcoloured hair and frigid face looked like the hair and face of a corpse walking youll never know what this is said ivywood in his most charming manner youve heard of him a hundred times and never had a notion of what he was this is the bulbul i never knew replied joan i am afraid i never cared i always thought it was something like a nightingale ah yes answered ivywood but this is the real bulbul peculiar to the east pycnonotus haemorrhous you are thinking of daulias golzii i suppose i am replied lady joan with a faint smile it is an obsession when shall i not be thinking of daulias galsworthy was it galsworthy then feeling quite touched by the soft austerity of her companions face she caressed the gaudy and pugnacious bird with one finger and said its a dear little thing the quadruped intimately called quoodle did not approve of all this at all like most dogs he liked to be with human beings when they were silent and he extended a magnificent toleration to them as long as they were talking to each other but conversational attention paid to any other animal at all remote from a mongrel bullterrier wounded mr quoodle in his most sensitive and gentlemanly feelings he emitted a faint growl joan with all the instincts that were in her bent down and pulled his hair about once more and felt the instant necessity of diverting the general admiration from pycnonotus haemorrhous she turned it to the decoration at the end of the refurnished wing for they had already come to the last of the long suite of rooms which ended in some unfinished but exquisite panelling in white and coloured woods inlaid in the oriental manner at one corner the whole corridor ended by curving into a round turret chamber overlooking the landscape and which joan who had known the house in childhood was sure was an innovation on the other hand a black gap still left in the lower lefthand corner of the oriental woodwork suddenly reminded her of something she had forgotten surely she said after much mere aesthetic ecstasy there used to be a staircase there leading to the old kitchen garden or the old chapel or something ivywood nodded gravely yes he said it did lead to the ruins of a mediaeval chapel as you say the truth is it led to several things that i cannot altogether consider a credit to the family in these days all that scandal and joking about the unsuccessful tunnel your mother may have told you of it well it did us no good in the county im afraid so as its a mere scrap of land bordering on the sea ive fenced it off and let it grow wild but im boarding up the end of the room here for quite another reason i want you to come and see it he led her into the round corner turret in which the new architecture ended and joan with her thirst for the beautiful could not stifle a certain thrill of beatitude at the prospect five open windows of a light and exquisite saracenic outline looked out over the bronze and copper and purple of the autumn parks and forests to the peacock colours of the sea there was neither house nor living thing in sight and familiar as she had been with that coast she knew she was looking out from a new angle of vision on a new landscape of ivywood you can write sonnets said ivywood with something more like emotion in his voice than she had ever heard in it what comes first into your mind with these open windows i know what you mean said joan after a silence the same hath oft yes he said that is how i felt of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn there was another silence and the dog sniffed round and round the circular turret chamber i want it to be like that said ivywood in a low and singularly moved intonation i want this to be the end of the house i want this to be the end of the world dont you feel that is the real beauty of all this eastern art that it is coloured like the edges of things like the little clouds of morning and the islands of the blest do you know and he lowered his voice yet more it has the power over me of making me feel as if i were myself absent and distant some oriental traveller who was lost and for whom men were looking when i see that greenish lemon yellow enamel there let into the white i feel that i am standing thousands of leagues from where i stand you are right said joan looking at him with some wonder i have felt like that myself this art went on ivywood as in a dream does indeed take the wings of the morning and abide in the uttermost parts of the sea they say it contains no form of life but surely we can read its alphabet as easily as the red hieroglyphics of sunrise and sunset which are on the fringes of the robe of god i never heard you talk like that before said the lady and again stroked the vivid violet feathers of the small eastern bird mr quoodle could stand it no longer he had evidently formed a very low opinion of the turret chamber and of oriental art generally but seeing joans attention once more transferred to his rival he trotted out into the longer room and finding the gap in the woodwork which was soon to be boarded up but which still opened on an old dark staircase he went galumphing down the stairs lord ivywood gently placed the bird on the girls own finger and went to one of the open windows leaning out a little look here he said doesnt this express what we both feel isnt this the sort of fairytale house that ought to hang on the last wall of the world and he motioned her to the windowsill just outside which hung the birds empty cage beautifully wrought in brass or some of the yellow metals why that is the best of all cried lady joan it makes one feel as if it really were the arabian nights as if this were a tower of the gigantic genii with turrets up to the moon and this were an enchanted prince caged in a golden palace suspended by the evening star something stirred in her dim but teeming subconsciousness something like a chill or change like that by which we half know that weather has altered or distant and unnoticed music suddenly ceased where is the dog she asked suddenly ivywood turned with a mild grey eye was there a dog here he asked yes said lady joan brett and gave him back the bird which he restored carefully to its cage the dog after whom she inquired had in truth trundled down a dark winding staircase and turned into the daylight into a part of the garden he had never seen before nor indeed had anybody else for some time past it was altogether tangled and overgrown with weeds and the only trace of human handiwork the wreck of an old gothic chapel stood waist high in numberless nettles and soiled with crawling fungoids most of these merely discoloured the grey crumbling stone with shades of bronze or brown but some of them particularly on the side farthest from the house were of orange or purple tints almost bright enough for lord ivywoods oriental decoration some fanciful eyes that fell on the place afterward found something like an allegory in those graven and broken saints or archangels feeding such fiery and ephemeral parasites as those toadstools like blood or gold but mr quoodle had never set himself up as an allegorist and he merely trotted deeper and deeper into the greygreen english jungle he grumbled very much at the thistles and nettles much as a city man will grumble at the jostling of a crowd but he continued to press forward with his nose near the ground as if he had already smelt something that interested him and indeed he had smelt something in which a dog except on special occasions is much more interested than he is in dogs breaking through a last barrier of high and hoary purple thistles he came out on a semicircle of somewhat clearer ground dotted with slender trees and having by way of back scene the brown brick arch of an old tunnel the tunnel was boarded up with a very irregular fence or mask made of motley wooden lathes and looked somehow rather like a pantomime cottage in front of this a sturdy man in very shabby shooting clothes was standing attending to a battered old fryingpan which he held over a rather irregular flame which small as it was smelt strongly of burnt rum in the fryingpan and also on the top of a cask or barrel that served for a table hard by were a number of the grey brown and even orange fungi which were plastered over the stone angels and dragons of the fallen chapel hullo old man said the person in the shooting jacket with tranquillity and without looking up from his cooking come to pay us a visit come along then he flashed one glance at the dog and returned to the frying pan if your tail were two inches shorter youd be worth a hundred pounds had any breakfast the dog trotted across to him and began nosing and sniffing round his dilapidated leather gaiters the man did not interrupt his cookery on which his eyes were fixed and both his hands were busy but he crooked his knee and foot so as to caress the quadruped in a nerve under the angle of the jaw the stimulation of which as some men of science have held is for a dog what a good cigar is for a man at the same moment a huge voice like on ogres came from within the masked tunnel calling out and who are ye talking to a very crooked kind of window in the upper part of the pantomime cottage burst open and an enormous head with erect startling and almost scarlet hair and blue eyes as big as a bullfrogs was thrust out above the scene hump cried the ogre me moral counsels have been thrown away in the last week ive sung you fourteen and a half songs of me own composition instead of which you go about stealing dogs youre following in the path of parson whatshisname in every way im afraid no said the man with the frying pan impartially parson whitelady struck a very good path for doubling on pebblewick that i was glad to follow but i think he was quite silly to steal dogs he was young and brought up pious i know too much about dogs to steal one well asked the large redhaired man and how do you get a dog like that i let him steal me said the person stirring the pan and indeed the dog was sitting erect and even arrogant at his feet as if he was a watchdog at a high salary and had been there before the building of the tunnel chapter xi vegetarianism in the drawingroom the company that assembled to listen to the prophet of the moon on the next occasion of his delivering any formal address was much more select than the comparatively mixed and middleclass society of the simple souls miss browning and her sister mrs mackintosh were indeed present for lord ivywood had practically engaged them both as private secretaries and kept them pretty busy too there was also mr leveson because lord ivywood believed in his organizing power and also mr hibbs because mr leveson believed in his political judgment whenever he could discover what it was mr leveson had straight dark hair and looked nervous mr hibbs had straight fair hair and also looked nervous but the rest of the company were more of ivywoods own world or the world of high finance with which it mixes both here and on the continent lord ivywood welcomed with something approaching to warmth a distinguished foreign diplomatist who was indeed none other than that silent german representative who had sat beside him in that last conference on the island of the olives dr gluck was no longer in his quiet black suit but wore an ornate diplomatic uniform with a sword and prussian austrian or turkish orders for he was going on from ivywood to a function at court but his curl of red lips his screw of black mustache and his unanswering almond eyes had no more changed than the face of a wax figure in a barbers shop window the prophet had also effected an improvement in his dress when he had orated on the sands his costume except for the fez was the shabby but respectable costume of any rather unsuccessful english clerk but now that he had come among aristocrats who petted their souls as they did their senses there must be no such incongruity he must be a proper freshpicked oriental tulip or lotus so he wore long flowing robes of white relieved here and there by flamecoloured threads of tracery and round his head was a turban of a kind of pale golden green he had to look as if he had come flying across europe on the magic carpet or fallen a moment before from his paradise in the moon the ladies of lord ivywoods world were much as we have already found them lady enid wimpole still overwhelmed her earnest and timid face with a tremendous costume that was more like a procession than a dress it looked rather like the funeral procession of aubrey beardsley lady joan brett still looked like a very beautiful spaniard with no illusions left about her castle in spain the large and resolute lady who had refused to ask any questions at misysras earlier lecture and who was known as lady crump the distinguished feminist still had the air of being so full and bursting with questions fatal to man as to have passed the speaking and reached the speechless stage of hostility throughout the proceedings she contributed nothing but bursting silence and a malevolent eye and old lady ivywood under the oldest and finest lace and the oldest and finest manners had a look like death on her which can often be seen in the parents of pure intellectuals she had that face of a lost mother that is more pathetic than the face of a lost child and what are you going to delight us with today lady enid was asking of the prophet my lecture answered misysra gravely is on the pig it was part of a simplicity really respectable in him that he never saw any incongruity in the arbitrary and isolated texts or symbols out of which he spun his thousand insane theories lady enid endured the impact of this singular subject for debate without losing that expression of wistful sweetness which she wore on principle when talking to such people the pig he is a large subject continued the prophet making curves in the air as if embracing some particularly prize specimen he includes many subjects it is to me very strange that the christians should so laugh and be surprised because we hold ourselves to be defiled by pork we and also another of the peoples of the book but surely you christians yourselves consider the pig as a manner of pollution since it is your most usual expression of your despising of your very great dislike you say swine my dear lady you do not say animals far more unpopular such as the alligator i see said the lady how wonderful if you are annoyed went on the encouraged and excited gentleman if you are annoyed with anyone with a what you say a ladys maid you do not say to her horse you do not say to her camel ah no said lady enid earnestly pig of a ladys maid you say in your colloquial english continued the prophet triumphantly and yet this great and awful pig this monster whose very name when whispered you think will wither all your enemies you allow my dear lady to approach yet closer to you you incorporate this great pig in the substance of your own person lady enid wimpole was looking a little dazed at last at this description of her habits and joan gave lord ivywood a hint that the lecturer had better be transferred to his legitimate sphere of lecturing ivywood led the way into a larger room that was full of ranked chairs with a sort of lectern at the other end and flanked on all four sides with tables laden with all kinds of refreshments it was typical of the strange halffictitious enthusiasm and curiosity of that world that one long table was set out entirely with vegetarian foods especially of an eastern sort like a table spread in the desert for a rather fastidious indian hermit but that tables covered with game patties lobster and champagne were equally provided and very much more frequented even mr hibbs who would honestly have thought entering a publichouse more disgraceful than entering a brothel could not connect any conception of disgrace with lord ivywoods champagne for the purpose of the lecture was not wholly devoted to the great and awful pig and the purpose of the meeting even less lord ivywood the white furnace of whose mind was always full of new fancies hardening into ambitions wanted to have a debate on the diet of east and west and felt that misysra might very appropriately open with an account of the moslem veto on pork or other coarse forms of flesh food he reserved it to himself to speak second the prophet began indeed with some of his dizziest flights he informed the company that they the english had always gone in hidden terror and loathing of the pig as a sacred symbol of evil he proved it by the common english custom of drawing a pig with ones eyes shut lady joan smiled and yet she asked herself in a doubt that had been darkening round her about many modern things lately whether it was really much more fanciful than many things the scientists told her as the traces of marriage by capture which they found in that ornamental and even frivolous being the best man he said that the dawn of greater enlightenment is shown in the use of the word gammon which still expresses disgust at the porcine image but no longer fear of it but rather a rational disdain and disbelief rowley said the prophet solemnly and then after a long pause powley gammon and spinach lady joan smiled again but again asked herself if it was much more farfetched than a history book she had read which proved the unpopularity of catholicism in tudor times from the word hocus pocus he got into a most amazing labyrinth of philology between the red primeval sins of the first pages of genesis and the common english word ham but again joan wondered whether it was much wilder than the other things she had heard said about primitive man by people who had never seen him he suggested that the irish were set to keep pigs because they were a low and defiled caste and the serfs of the pigscorning saxon and joan thought it was about as sensible as what the dear old archdeacon had said about ireland years ago which had caused an irishman of her acquaintance to play the shan van voght and then smash the piano joan brett had been thoughtful for the last few days it was partly due to the scene in the turret where she had struck a sensitive and artistic side of philip ivywood she had never seen before and partly to disturbing news of her mothers health which though not menacing made her feel hypothetically how isolated she was in the world on all previous occasions she had merely enjoyed the mad lecturer now at the readingdesk today she felt a strange desire to analyse him and imagine how a man could be so connected and so convinced and yet so wildly wide of the mark as she listened carefully looking at the hands in her lap she began to think she understood the lecturer did really try to prove that the porcine image had never been used in english history or literature except in contempt and the lecturer really did know a very great deal about english history and literature much more than she did much more than the aristocrats round her did but she noted that in every case what he knew was a fragmentary fact in every case what he did not know was the truth behind the fact what he did not know was the atmosphere what he did not know was the tradition she found herself ticking off the cases like counts in an indictment misysra ammon knew what next to none of the english present knew that richard iii was called a boar by an eighteenth century poet and a hog by a fifteenth century poet what he did not know was the habit of sport and of heraldry he did not know what joan knew instantly though she had never thought of it before in her life that beasts courageous and hard to kill are noble beasts by the law of chivalry therefore the boar was a noble beast and a common crest for great captains misysra tried to show that richard had only been called a pig after he was cold pork at bosworth misysra ammon knew what next to none of the english present knew that there never was such a person as lord bacon the phrase is a falsification of what should be lord verulam or lord st albans what he did not know was exactly what joan did know though it had never crossed her mind till that moment that when all is said and done a title is a sort of joke while a surname is a serious thing bacon was a gentleman and his name was bacon whatever titles he took but misysra seriously tried to prove that bacon was a term of abuse applied to him during his unpopularity or after his fall misysra ammon knew what next to none of the english present knew that the poet shelley had a friend called hogg who treated him on one occasion with grave treachery he instantly tried to prove that the man was only called hogg because he had treated shelley with grave treachery and he actually adduced the fact that another poet practically contemporary was called hogg as completing the connection with shelley what he did not know was just what joan had always known without knowing it the kind of people concerned the traditions of aristocrats like the shelleys or of borderers like the ettrick shepherd the lecturer concluded with a passage of impenetrable darkness about pigiron and pigs of lead which joan did not even venture to understand she could only say that if it did not mean that some day our diet might become so refined that we ate lead and iron she could form no fancy of what it did mean can philip ivywood believe this kind of thing she asked herself and even as she did so philip ivywood rose he had as pitt and gladstone had an impromptu classicism of diction his words wheeling and deploying into their proper places like a welldisciplined army in its swiftest advance and it was not long before joan perceived that the last phase of the picture obscure and monstrous as it seemed gave ivywood exactly the opening he wanted indeed she felt no doubt that he had arranged for it beforehand it is within my memory said lord ivywood though it need in no case have encumbered yours that when it was my duty to precede the admired lecturer whom i now feel it a privilege even to follow i submitted a suggestion which however simple would appear to many paradoxical i affirmed or implied the view that the religion of mahomet was in a peculiar sense a religion of progress this is so contrary not only to historical convention but to common platitude that i shall find no ground either of surprise or censure if it takes a perceptible time before it sinks into the mind of the english public but i think ladies and gentlemen that this period is notably abbreviated by the remarkable exposition which we have heard today for this question of the attitude of islam toward food affords as excellent an example of its special mode of progressive purification as the more popular example of its attitude toward drink for it illustrates that principle which i have ventured to call the principle of the crescent the principle of perpetual growth toward an implied and infinite perfection the great religion of islam does not of itself forbid the eating of flesh foods but in accordance with that principle of growth which is its life it has pointed the way to a perfection not yet perhaps fully attainable by our nature it has taken a plain and strong example of the dangers of meateating and hung up the repellent carcass as a warning and a sign in the gradual emergence of mankind from a gross and sanguinary mode of sustenance the semite has led the way he has laid as it were a symbolic embargo upon the beast typical the beast of beasts with the instinct of the true mystic he selected for exemption from such cannibal feasts the creature which appeals to both sides of the higher vegetarian ethic the pig is at once the creature whose helplessness most moves our pity and whose ugliness most repels our taste it would be foolish to affirm that no difficulty arises out of the different stages of moral evolution in which the different races find themselves thus it is constantly said and such things are not said without some excuse in document or incident that followers of the prophet have specialised in the arts of war and have come into a contact not invariably friendly with those hindoos of india who have specialised in the arts of peace in the same way the hindoos it must be confessed have been almost as much in advance of islam in the question of meat as islam is in advance of christianity in the matter of drink it must be remembered again and again ladies and gentlemen that every allegation we have of any difference between hindoo and moslem comes through a christian channel and is therefore tainted evidence but in this matter even can we not see the perils of disregarding such plain danger signals as the veto on pork did not an empire nearly slip out of our hands because our hands were greased with cowfat and did not the well of cawnpore brim with blood instead of water because we would not listen to the instinct of the oriental about the shedding of sacred blood but if it be proposed with whatever graduation to approach that repudiation of flesh food which buddhism mainly and islam partly recommends it will always be asked by those who hate the very vision of progress where do you draw the line may i eat oysters may i eat eggs may i drink milk you may you may eat or drink anything essential to your stage of evolution so long as you are evolving toward a clearer and cleaner ideal of bodily life if he said gravely i may employ a phrase of flippancy i would say that you may eat six dozen oysters today but i should strongly advise five dozen oysters tomorrow for how else has all progress in public or private manners been achieved would not the primitive cannibals be surprised at the strange distinction we draw between men and beasts all historians pay high honour to the huguenots and the great huguenot prince henri quatre none need deny that his aspiration that every frenchman should have a chicken in his pot was for his period a high aspiration it is no disrespect to him that we mounting to higher levels and looking down longer perspectives consider the chicken and this august march of discovery passes figures higher than that of henry of navarre i shall always give a high place as islam has always given a high place to that figure mythical or no which we find presiding over the foundations of christianity i cannot doubt that the fable incredible and revolting otherwise which records the rush of swine into the sea was an allegory of his early realisation that a spirit evil indeed does reside in all animals in so far as they tempt us to devour them i cannot doubt that the prodigal leaving his sins among the swine is another illustration of the great thesis of the prophet of the moon but here also progress and relativity are relentless in their advance and not a few of us may have risen today to the point of regretting that the joyful sounds around the return of the prodigal should be marred by the moaning of a calf for the rest he who asks us whither we go knows not the meaning of progress if we come at last to live on light as men said of the chameleon if some cosmic magic closed to us now as radium was but recently closed allows us to transmute the very metals into flesh without breaking into the bloody house of life we shall know these things when we have achieved them it is enough for us now if we have reached a spiritual station in which at least the living head we lop has not eyes to reproach us and the herbs we gather cannot cry against our cruelty like the mandrake lord ivywood resumed his seat his colourless lips still moving by some previous arrangement probably mr leveson rose to move a motion about vegetarianism mr leveson was of opinion that the jewish and moslem veto on pork had been the origin of vegetarianism he thought it was a great step and showed how progressive the creed could be he thought the persecution of the hindoos by moslems had probably been much exaggerated he thought our experience in the indian mutiny showed we considered the feeling of easterners too little in such matters he thought vegetarianism in some ways an advance on orthodox christianity he thought we must be ready for yet further advances and he sat down and as he had said precisely clause by clause everything that lord ivywood had said it is needless to say that that nobleman afterward congratulated him on the boldness and originality of his brilliant speech at a similar sort of preconcerted signal hibbs however rose rather vaguely to his feet to second the motion he rather prided himself on being a man of few words in the vocal sense he was no orator as brutus was it was only with pen in hand in an office lined with works of reference that he could feel that sense of confused responsibility that was the one pleasure of his life but on this occasion he was brighter than usual partly because he liked being in a lords house partly because he had never tasted champagne before and he felt as if it agreed with him partly because he saw in the subject of progress an infinite opportunity of splitting hairs whatever said hibbs with a solemn cough whatever we may think of the old belief that moslems have differed from buddhism in a regrettable way there can be no doubt the responsibility lay with the christian churches had the free churches put their foot down and met messrs opalsteins demand we should have heard nothing of these old differences between one belief and another as it was it reminded him of napoleon he gave his own opinion for what it was worth but he was not afraid to say at any cost even there and in that company that this business of asiatic vegetation had occupied less of the time of the wesleyan conference than it should have done he would be the last to say of course that anyone was in any sense to blame they all knew dr coons qualifications they all knew as well as he did that a more strenuous social worker than charles chadder had never rallied the forces of progress but that which was not really an indiscretion might be represented as an indiscretion and perhaps we had had enough of that just lately it was all very well to talk about coffe but it should be remembered with no disrespect to those in canada to whom we owe so much that all that happened before no one had less desire to offend our ritualistic friends than he did but he had no hesitation in saying that the question was a question that could be asked and though no doubt from one point of view the goats lady joan moved sharply in her chair as if gripped by sudden pain and indeed she had suddenly felt the chronic and recurrent pain of her life she was brave about bodily pain as are most women even luxurious women but the torment that from time to time returned and tore her was one to which many philosophical names have been given but no name so philosophical as boredom she felt she could not stand a minute more of mr hibbs she felt she would die if she heard about the goats from one or any point of view she slipped from her chair and somehow slid round the corner in pretence of seeking one of the tables of refreshment in the new wing she was soon among the new oriental apartments now almost completed but she took no refreshments though attenuated tables could still be found here and there she threw herself on an ottoman and stared toward the empty and elfin turret chambers in which ivywood had made her understand that he also could thirst for beauty and desire to be at peace he certainly had a poetry of his own after all a poetry that never touched earth the poetry of shelley rather than shakespeare his phrase about the fairy turret was true it did look like the end of the world it did seem to teach her that there is always some serene limit at last she started and half rose on her elbow with a small laugh a dog of ludicrous but familiar appearance came shuffling toward her and she lifted herself in the act of lifting him she also lifted her head and saw something that seemed to her in a sense more christian and catastrophic very like the end of the world chapter xii vegetarianism in the forest humphrey pumps cooking of a fungus in an old fryingpan which he had found on the beach was extremely typical of him he was indeed without any pretence of booklearning a certain kind of scientific man that science has really been unfortunate in losing he was the oldfashioned english naturalist like gilbert white or even isaac walton who learned things not academically like an american professor but actually like an american indian and every truth a man has found out as a man of science is always subtly different from any truth he has found out as a man because a mans family friends habits and social type have always got well under way before he has thoroughly learned the theory of anything for instance any eminent botanist at a soire of the royal society could tell you of course that other edible fungi exist as well as mushrooms and truffles but long before he was a botanist still less an eminent botanist he had begun so to speak on a basis of mushrooms and truffles he felt in a vague way that these were really edible that mushrooms were a moderate luxury proper to the middle classes while truffles were a much more expensive luxury more suitable to the smart set but the old english naturalists of whom isaac walton was perhaps the first and humphrey pump perhaps the last had in many cases really begun at the other end and found by experience often most disastrous experience that some fungi are wholesome and some are not but the wholesome ones are on a whole the majority so a man like pump was no more afraid of a fungus as such than he was of an animal as such he no more started with the supposition that a grey or purple growth on a stone must be a poisonous growth than he started with the supposition that the dog who came to him out of the wood must be a mad dog most of them he knew those he did not know he treated with rational caution but to him as a whole race these weirdhued and onelegged goblins of the forests were creatures friendly to man you see he said to his friend the captain eating vegetables isnt half bad so long as you know what vegetables there are and eat all of them that you can but there are two ways where it goes wrong among the gentry first theyve never had to eat a carrot or a potato because it was all there was in the house so theyve never learnt how to be really hungry for carrots as that donkey might be they only know the vegetables that are meant to help the meat they know you take duck and peas and when they turn vegetarian they can only think of the peas without the duck they know you take lobster in a salad and when they turn vegetarian they can only think of the salad without the lobster but the other reason is worse theres plenty of good people even round here and still more in the north who get meat very seldom but then when they do get it they gobble it up like good uns but the trouble with the gentry is different the trouble is the same sort of gentry that dont want to eat meat dont really want to eat anything the man called a vegetarian who goes to ivywood house is generally like a cow trying to live on a blade of grass a day you and i captain have pretty well been vegetarians for some time so as not to break into the cheese and we havent found it so difficult because we eat as much as we can its not so difficult as being teetotallers answered dalroy so as not to break into the cask but ill never deny that i feel the better for that too on the whole but only because i could leave off being one whenever i chose and now i come to think of it he cried with one of his odd returns of animal energy if im to be a vegetarian why shouldnt i drink why shouldnt i have a purely vegetarian drink why shouldnt i take vegetables in their highest form so to speak the modest vegetarians ought obviously to stick to wine or beer plain vegetarian drinks instead of filling their goblets with the blood of bulls and elephants as all conventional meateaters do i suppose what is the matter nothing answered pump i was looking out for somebody who generally turns up about this time but i think im fast i should never have thought so from the look of you answered the captain but what im saying is that the drinking of decent fermented liquor is just simply the triumph of vegetarianism why its an inspiring idea i could write a sort of song about it as for instance you will find me drinking rum like a sailor in a slum you will find me drinking beer like a bavarian you will find me drinking gin in the lowest kind of inn because i am a rigid vegetarian why its a vista of verbal felicity and spiritual edification it has i dont know how many hundred aspects lets see how could the second verse go something like so i cleared the inn of wine and i tried to climb the sign and i tried to hail the constable as marion but he said i couldnt speak and he bowled me to the beak because i was a happy vegetarian i really think something instructive to the human race may come out of all this hullo is that what you were looking for the quadruped quoodle came in out of the woods a whole minute later than the usual time and took his seat beside humphreys left foot with a preoccupied air good old boy said the captain you seem to have taken quite a fancy to us i doubt hump if hes properly looked after up at the house i particularly dont want to talk against ivywood hump i dont want his soul to be able in all eternity to accuse my soul of a mean detraction i want to be fair to him because i hate him like hell and he has taken from me all for which i lived but i dont think with all this in my mind i dont think i say anything beyond what he would own himself for his brain is clear when i say that he could never understand an animal and so he could never understand the animal side of a man he doesnt know to this day hump that your sight and hearing are sixty times quicker than his he doesnt know that i have a better circulation that explains the extraordinary people he picks up and acts with he never looks at them as you and i look at that dog there was a fellow calling himself gluck who was mainly by ivywoods influence i believe his colleague on the turkish conferences being supposed to represent germany my dear hump he was a man that a great gentleman like ivywood ought not to have touched with a bargepole its not the race he was if it was one race its the sort he was a coarse common levantine nark and eavesdropper but you mustnt lose your temper hump i implore you hump to control this tendency to lose your temper when talking at any length about such people have recourse hump to that consoling system of versification which i have already explained to you oh i knew a doctor gluck and his nose it had a hook and his attitudes were anything but aryan so i gave him all the pork that i had upon a fork because i am myself a vegetarian if you are said humphrey pump youd better come and eat some vegetables the white hat can be eaten cold or raw for that matter but bloodspots wants some cooking you are right hump said dalroy seating himself with every appearance of speechless greed i will be silent as the poet says i am silent in the club i am silent in the pub i am silent on a bally peak in darien for i stuff away for life shoving peas in with a knife because i am at heart a vegetarian he fell to his food with great gusto dispatched a good deal of it in a very short time threw a glance of gloomy envy at the cask and then sprang to his feet again he caught up the innsign from where it leant against the pantomime cottage and planted it like a pike in the ground beside him then he began to sing again in an even louder voice than before o lord ivywood may lop and his privilege is sylvan and riparian and is also free to top but do you know said hump also finishing his lunch that im rather tired of that particular tune tired is it said the indignant irishman then ill sing you a longer song to an even worse tune about more and more vegetarians and you shall see me dance as well and i will dance till you burst into tears and offer me the half of your kingdom and i shall ask for mr levesons head on the fryingpan for this let me tell you is a song of oriental origin celebrating the caprices of an ancient babylonian sultan and should be performed in palaces of ivory with palm trees and a bulbul accompaniment and he began to bellow another and older lyric of his own on vegetarianism nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews suffered from new and original views he crawled on his hands and knees its said with grass in his mouth and a crown on his head with a wowtyiddly etc those in traditional paths that trod thought the thing was a curse from god but a pioneer men always abuse like nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews dalroy as he sang this actually began to dance about like a ballet girl an enormous and ridiculous figure in the sunlight waving the wooden sign around his head quoodle opened his eyes and pricked up his ears and seemed much interested in these extraordinary evolutions suddenly with one of those startling changes that will transfigure the most sedentary dogs quoodle decided that the dance was a game and began to bark and bound round the performer sometimes leaping so far into the air as almost to threaten the mans throat but though the sailor naturally knew less about dogs than the countryman he knew enough about them as about many other things not to be afraid and the voice he sang with might have drowned the baying of a pack black lord foulon the frenchmen slew thought it a futurist thing to do he offered them grass instead of bread so they stuffed him with grass when they cut off his head with a wowtyiddly etc for the pride of his soul he perished then but of course it is always of pride that men a man in advance of his age accuse like nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews simeon scudder of styx in maine thought of the thing and was at it again he gave good grass and water in pails to a thousand irishmen hammering rails with a wowtyiddly etc appetites differ and tied to a stake he was tarred and feathered for conscience sake but stoning the prophets is ancient news like nebuchadnezzar the king of the jews in an abandon unusual even for him he had danced his way down through the thistles into the jungle of weeds risen round the sunken chapel and the dog now fully convinced that it was not only a game but an expedition perhaps a hunting expedition ran barking in front of him along the path that his own dogs paws had already burst through the tangle before patrick dalroy well knew what he was doing or even remembered that he still carried the ridiculous signboard in his hand he found himself outside the open porch of a sort of narrow tower at the angle of a building which to the best of his recollection he had never seen before quoodle instantly ran up four or five steps in the dark staircase inside and then lifting his ears again looked back for his companion there is perhaps such a thing as asking too much of a man if there is it was asking too much of patrick dalroy to ask him not to accept so eccentric an invitation hurriedly plunging his unwieldy wooden ensign upright in the thick of thistles and grass he bent his gigantic neck and shoulders to enter the porch and proceeded to climb the stairs it was quite dark and it was only after at least two twists of the stone spiral that he saw light ahead of him and then it was a sort of rent in the wall that seemed to him as ragged as the mouth of a cornish cave it was also so low that he had some difficulty in squeezing his bulk through it but the dog had jumped through with an air of familiarity and once more looked back to see him follow if he had found himself inside any ordinary domestic interior he would instantly have repented his escapade and gone back but he found himself in surroundings which he had never seen before or even in one sense believed possible his first feeling was that he was walking in the most sealed and secret suite of apartments in the castle of a dream all the chambers had that air of perpetually opening inwards which is the soul of the arabian nights and the ornament was of the same tradition gorgeous and flamboyant yet featureless and stiff a purple mansion seemed to be built inside a green mansion and a golden mansion inside that and the quaintly cut doorways or fretted lattices all had wavy lines like a dancing sea and for some reason seasickness for all he knew this gave him a feeling as if the place were beautiful but faintly evil as if it were bored and twisted for the fallen palace of the worm but he had also another sensation which he could not analyze for it reminded him of being a fly on the ceiling or the wall was it the hanging gardens of babylon coming back to his imagination or the castle east of the sun and west of the moon then he remembered that in some boyish illness he had stared at a rather moorish sort of wall paper which was like rows and rows of brightly coloured corridors empty and going on forever and he remembered that a fly was walking along one of the parallel lines and it seemed to his childish fancy that the corridors were all dead in front of the fly but all came to life as he passed by george he cried i wonder whether thats the real truth about east and west that the gorgeous east offers everything needed for adventures except the man to enjoy them it would explain the tradition of the crusades uncommonly well perhaps thats what god meant by europe and asia we dress the characters and they paint the scenery well anyhow three of the least asiatic things in the world are lost in this endless asiatic palace a good dog a straight sword and an irishman but as he went down this telescope of tropical colours he really felt something of that hard fatalistic freedom of the heroes or should we say villains in the arabian nights he was prepared for any impossibility he would hardly have been surprised if from under the lid of one of the porcelain pots standing in a corner had come a serpentine string of blue or yellow smoke as if some wizards oil were within he would hardly have been surprised if from under the curtains or closed doors had crawled out a snaky track of blood or if a dumb negro dressed in white had come out with a bow string having done his work he would not have been surprised if he had walked suddenly into the still chamber of some sultan asleep whom to wake was a death in torments and yet he was very much more surprised by what he did see and when he saw it he was certain at last that he was only wandering in the labyrinth of his own brain for what he saw was what was really in the core of all his dreams what he saw indeed was more appropriate to that inmost eastern chamber than anything he had imagined on a divan of bloodred and orange cushions lay a startlingly beautiful woman with a skin almost swarthy enough for an arabs and who might well have been the princess proper to such an arabian tale but in truth it was not her appropriateness to the scene but rather her inappropriateness that made his heart bound it was not her strangeness but her familiarity that made his big feet suddenly stop the dog ran on yet more rapidly and the princess on the sofa welcomed him warmly lifting him on his short hind legs then she looked up and seemed turned to stone bismillah said the oriental traveller affably may your shadow never grow less or more as the ladies would say the commander of the faithful has deputed his least competent slave to bring you back a dog owing to temporary delay in collecting the fifteen largest diamonds in the moon he has been compelled to send the animal without any collar those responsible for the delay will instantly be beaten to death with the tails of dragons the frightful shock which had not yet left the ladys face brought him back to responsible speech in short he said in the name of the prophet dog i say joan i wish this wasnt a dream it isnt said the girl speaking for the first time and i dont know yet whether i wish it was well argued the dreamer rationally what are you anytime if youre not a dream or a vision and what are all these rooms if they arent a dream or rather a nightmare this is the new wing of ivywood house said the lady addressed as joan speaking with great difficulty lord ivywood has fitted them up in the eastern style he is inside conducting a most interesting debate in defence of eastern vegetarianism i only came out because the room was rather hot vegetarian cried dalroy with abrupt and rather unreasonable exasperation that table seems to fall a bit short of vegetarianism and he pointed to one of the long narrow tables laid somewhere in almost all the central rooms and loaded with elaborate cold meats and expensive wines he must be liberalminded cried joan who seemed to be on the verge of something possibly temper he cant expect people suddenly to begin being vegetarians when theyve never been before it has been done said dalroy tranquilly walking across to look at the table i say your ascetical friends seem to have made a pretty good hole in the champagne you may not believe it joan but i havent touched what you call alcohol for a month with which words he filled with champagne a large tumbler intended for claret cup and swallowed it at a draught lady joan brett stood up straight but trembling now thats really wrong pat she cried oh dont be silly you know i dont care about the alcohol or all that but youre in the mans house uninvited and he doesnt know that wasnt like you he shall know all right said the large man quietly i know the exact price of a tumbler of that champagne and he scribbled some words in pencil on the back of a bill of fare on the table and then carefully laid three shillings on top of it and there you do philip the worst wrong of all cried lady joan flaming white you know as well as i do anyhow that he would not take your money patrick dalroy stood looking at her for some seconds with an expression on his broad and unusually open face which she found utterly puzzling curiously enough he observed at last and with absolutely even temper curiously enough it is you who are doing philip ivywood a wrong i think him quite capable of breaking england or creation but i do honestly think he would never break his word and what is more i think the more arbitrary and literal his word had been the more he would keep it you will never understand a man like that till you understand that he can have devotion to a definition even a new definition he can really feel about an amendment to an act of parliament inserted at the last moment as you feel about england or your mother oh dont philosophise cried joan suddenly cant you see this has been a shock i only want you to see the point he replied lord ivywood clearly told me with his own careful lips that i might go in and pay for fermented liquor in any place displaying a public sign outside and he wont go back on that definition or on any definition if he finds me here he may quite possibly put me in prison on some other charge as a thief or a vagabond or what not but he will not grudge the champagne and he will accept the three shillings and i shall honour him for his glorious consistency i dont understand said joan one word of what you are talking about which way did you come how can i get you away you dont seem to grasp that youre in ivywood house you see theres a new name outside the gate observed patrick conversationally and led the lady to the end of the corridor by which he had entered and into its ultimate turret chamber following his indications lady joan peered a little over the edge of the window where hung the brilliant purple bird in its brilliant golden cage almost immediately below outside the entrance to the halfclosed stairway stood a wooden tavern sign as solid and still as if it had been there for centuries all back at the sign of the old ship you see said the captain can i offer you anything in a ladylike way there was a vast impudence in the slight hospitable movement of his hand that disturbed lady joans features with an emotion other than any that she desired to show well cried patrick with a wild geniality ive made you laugh again my dear he caught her to him as in a whirlwind and then vanished from the fairy turret like a blast leaving her standing with her hand up to her wild black hair chapter xiii the battle of the tunnel what joan brett really felt as she went back from the second ttette she had experienced in the turret it is doubtful if anyone will ever know but she was full of the pungent feminine instinct to drive at practice and what she did clearly realise was the pencil writing dalroy had left on the back of lord ivywoods menu heaven alone knew what it was and as it pleased her profane temper to tell herself she was not satisfied with heaven alone knowing she went swiftly back with swishing skirts to the table where it had been left but her skirts fell more softly and her feet trailed slower and more in her usual manner as she came near the table for standing at it was lord ivywood reading the card with tranquil lowered eyelids that set off perfectly the long and perfect oval of his face he put down the card with a quite natural action and seeing joan smiled at her in his most sympathetic way so youve come out too he said so have i its really too hot for anything dr gluck is making an uncommonly good speech but i couldnt stop even for that dont you think my eastern decorations are rather a success after all a sort of vegetarianism in design isnt it he led her up and down the corridors pointing out lemoncoloured crescents or crimson pomegranates in the scheme of ornament with such utter detachment that they twice passed the open mouth of the hall of debate and joan could distinctly hear the voice of the diplomatic gluck saying indeed we owe our knowledge of the pollution of the pork primarily to the jewth and not the mothlemth i do not thare that prejudithe against the jewth which ith too common in my family and all the arithtocratic and military prutthian familieth i think we prutthian arithtocrats owe everything to the jewth the jewth have given to our old teutonic rugged virtueth jutht that touch of refinement jutht that intellectual thuperiority which and then the voice would die away behind as lord ivywood lectured luxuriantly and very well on the peacock tail in decoration or some more extravagant eastern version of the greek key but the third time they turned they heard the noise of subdued applause and the breaking up the meeting and people came pouring forth with stillness and swiftness ivywood pitched on the people he wanted and held them he buttonholed leveson and was evidently asking him to do something which neither of the two liked doing if your lordship insists she heard leveson whispering of course i will go myself but there is a great deal to be done here with your lordships immediate matters and if there were anyone else if philip lord ivywood had ever looked at a human being in his life he would have seen that j leveson secretary was suffering from a very ancient human malady excusable in all men and rather more excusable in one who has had his tophat smashed over his eyes and has run for his life as it was he saw nothing but merely said oh well get someone else what about your friend hibbs leveson ran across to hibbs who was drinking another glass of champagne at one of the innumerable buffets hibbs said leveson rather nervously will you do lord ivywood a favour he says you have so much tact it seems possible that a man may be hanging about the grounds just below that turret there he is a man it would certainly be lord ivywoods public duty to put into the hands of the police if he is there but then again he is quite capable of not being there at all i mean of having sent his message from somewhere else and in some other way naturally lord ivywood doesnt want to alarm the ladies and perhaps turn the laugh against himself by getting up a sort of police raid about nothing he wants some sensible tactful friend of his to go down and look round the place its a sort of disused garden and report if theres anyone about id go myself but im wanted here hibbs nodded and filled another glass but theres a further difficulty went on leveson hes a clever brute it seems a remarkable and a dangerous man were his lordships words and it looks as if hed spotted a very good hidingplace a disused tunnel leading to the sands just beyond the disused garden and chapel its a smart choice you see for he can bolt into the woods if anyone comes from the shore or on to the shore if anyone comes from the woods but it would take a good time even to get the police here and it would take ten times longer to get em round to the sea end of the tunnel especially as the sea comes up to the cliffs once or twice between here and pebblewick so we mustnt frighten him away or hell get a start if you meet anyone down there talk to him quite naturally and come back with the news we wont send for the police till you come talk as if you were just wandering like himself his lordship wishes your presence to appear quite accidental wishes my presence to appear quite accidental repeated hibbs gravely when the feverish leveson had flashed off satisfied hibbs took a glass or two more of wine feeling that he was going on a great diplomatic mission to please a lord then he went through the opening picked his way down the stair and somehow found his way out into the neglected garden and shrubbery it was already evening and an early moon was brightening over the sunken chapel with its dragoncoloured scales of fungus the night breeze was very fresh and had a marked effect on mr hibbs he found himself taking a meaningless pleasure in the scene especially in one fungus that was white with brown spots he laughed shortly to think that it should be white with brown spots then he said with carefully accurate articulation his lordship wishes my presence to appear quite accidental then he tried to remember something else that leveson had said he began to wade through the waves of weed and thorn past the chapel but he found the soil much more uneven and obstructive than he had supposed he slipped and sought to save himself by throwing one arm round a broken stone angel at a corner of the heap of gothic fragments but it was loose and rocked in its socket mr hibbs presented for a moment the appearance of waltzing with the angel in the moonlight in a very amorous and irreverent manner then the statue rolled over one way and he rolled over the other and lay on his face in the grass making inaudible remarks he might have lain there for some time or at least found some difficulty in rising but for another circumstance the dog quoodle with characteristic officiousness had followed him down the dark stairs and out of the doorway and finding him in this unusual posture began to bark as if the house were on fire this brought a heavy human footstep from the more hidden parts of the copse and in a minute or two the large man with the red hair was looking down at him in undisguised wonder hibbs said in a muffled voice which came obscurely from under his hidden face wish my presence to appear quite accidental it does said the captain can i help you up are you hurt he gently set the prostrate gentleman on his feet and looked genuinely concerned the fall had somewhat sobered lord ivywoods representative and he really had a red graze on the left cheek that looked more ugly than it was i am so sorry said patrick dalroy cordially come and sit down in our camp my friend pump will be back presently and hes a capital doctor his friend pump may or may not have been a capital doctor but the captain himself was certainly a most inefficient one so small was his talent for diagnosing the nature of a disease at sight that having given mr hibbs a seat on a fallen tree by the tunnel he proceeded to give him in mere automatic hospitality a glass of rum mr hibbss eyes awoke again when he had sipped it but they awoke to a new world wharever may be our invidual pinions he said and looked into space with an expression of humorous sagacity he then put his hand hazily in his pocket as if to find some letter he had to deliver he found nothing but his old journalistic note book which he often carried when there was a chance of interviewing anybody the feel of it under his fingers changed the whole attitude of his mind he took it out and said and wha would you say of vegetarianism colonel pump i think it palls replied the recipient of this complex title staring sha we say asked hibbs brightly turning a leaf in his note book sha we say long been strong vegetarian by conviction no i have only once been convicted answered dalroy with restraint and i hope to lead a better life when i come out hopes lead better life murmured hibbs writing eagerly with the wrong end of his pencil and wha would you shay was best vegable food for really strong vegetarian by conviction thistles said the captain wearily but i dont know much about it you know lord ivywoo strong vegtarian by conviction said mr hibbs shaking his head with unction lord ivywoo says tact talk to him naturally and so i do thats what i do talk to him naturally humphrey pump came through the clearer part of the wood leading the donkey who had just partaken of the diet recommended to a vegetarian by conviction the dog sprang up and ran to them pump was perhaps the most naturally polite man in the world and said nothing but his eyes had accepted with one snap of surprise the other fact also not unconnected with diet which had escaped dalroys notice when he administered rum as a restorative lord ivywoo says murmured the journalistic diplomatist lord ivywoo says talk as if you were just wandering thats it thats tact thats what ive got to do talk as if i was just wandering long way round to other end tunnel sea and cliffs don sphose they can swim he seized his note book again and looked in vain for his pencil good subjec correspondence can policemn swim policemen said dalroy in a dead silence the dog looked up and the innkeeper did not get to ivywoo one thing reasoned the diplomatist get policemen beach other end other thing no good do one thing no do other thing no goo do other thing no do other thing wish my presence appear quite accidental haw ill harness the donkey said pump will he go through that door asked dalroy with a gesture toward the entrance of the rough boarding with which they had faced the tunnel or shall i smash it all at once hell go through all right answered pump i saw to that when i made it and i think ill get him to the safe end of the tunnel before i load him up the best thing you can do is to pull up one of those saplings to bar the door with thatll delay them a minute or two though i think weve got warning in pretty easy time he led his donkey to the cart and carefully harnessed the donkey like all men cunning in the old healthy sense he knew that the last chance of leisure ought to be leisurely in order that it may be lucid then he led the whole equipment through the temporary wooden door of the tunnel the inquisitive quoodle of course following at his heels excuse me if i take a tree said dalroy politely to his guest like a man reaching across another man for a match and with that he rent up a young tree by its roots as he had done in the island of the olives and carried it on his shoulder like the club of hercules up in ivywood house lord ivywood had telephoned twice to pebblewick it was a delay he seldom suffered and though he never expressed impatience in unnecessary words he expressed it in unnecessary walking he would not yet send for the police without news from his ambassador but he thought a preliminary conversation with some police authorities he knew well might advance matters seeing leveson rather shrunk in a corner he wheeled round in his walk and said abruptly you must go and see what has happened to hibbs if you have any other duties here i authorize you to neglect them otherwise i can only say at this moment the telephone rang and the impatient nobleman rushed for his delayed call with a rapidity he seldom showed there was simply nothing for leveson to do except to do as he was told or be sacked he walked swiftly toward the staircase and only stopped once at the table where hibbs had stood and gulped down two goblets of the same wine but let no man attribute to mr leveson the loose and luxurious social motives of mr hibbs mr leveson did not drink for pleasure in fact he hardly knew what he was drinking his motive was something far more simple and sincere a sentiment forcibly described in legal phraseology as going in bodily fear he was partly nerved but by no means reconciled to his adventure when he crept carefully down the stairs and peered about the thicket for any signs of his diplomatic friend he could find neither sight nor sound to guide him except a sort of distant singing which greatly increased in volume of sound as he pursued it the first words he heard seemed to run something like no more the milk of cows shall pollute my private house than the milk of the wild mares of the barbarian i will stick to port and sherry for they are so very very so very very very vegetarian leveson did not know the huge and horrible voice in which these words were shouted but he had a most strange and even sickening suspicion that he did know the voice however altered the quavering and rather refined voice that joined in the chorus and sang because they are so vegy so vegy vegy vegy vegetarian terror lit up his wits and he made a wild guess at what had happened with a gasp of relief he realised that he had now good excuse for returning to the house with the warning he ran there like a hare still hearing the great voice from the woods like the roaring of a lion in his ear he found lord ivywood in consultation with dr gluck and also with mr bullrose the agent whose froglike eyes hardly seemed to have recovered yet from the fairytale of the flying signboard in the english lane but who to do him justice was more plucky and practical than most of lord ivywoods present advisers im afraid mr hibbs has inadvertently stammered leveson im afraid he has im afraid the man is making his escape my lord you had better send for the police ivywood turned to the agent you go and see whats happening he said simply i will come myself when ive rung them up and get some of the servants up with sticks and things fortunately the ladies have gone to bed hullo is that the police station bullrose went down into the shrubbery and had for many reasons less difficulty in crossing it than the hilarious hibbs the moon had increased to an almost unnatural brilliancy so that the whole scene was like a rather silver daylight and in this clear medium he beheld a very tall man with erect red hair and a colossal cylinder of cheese carried under one arm while he employed the other to wag a big forefinger at a dog with whom he was conversing it was the agents duty and desire to hold the man whom he recognised from the signboard mystery in play and conversation and prevent his final escape but there are some people who really cannot be courteous even when they want to be and mr bullrose was one of them lord ivywood he said abruptly wants to know what you want do not however fall into the common error quoodle dalroy was saying to the dog whose unfathomable eyes were fixed on his face of supposing that the phrase good dog is used in its absolute sense a dog is good or bad negatively to a limited scheme of duties created by human civilization what are you doing here asked mr bullrose a dog my dear quoodle continued the captain cannot be either so good or bad as a man nay i should go farther i would almost say a dog cannot be so stupid as a man he cannot be utterly wanting as a dog as some men are as men answer me you there roared the agent it is all the more pathetic continued the captain to whose monologue quoodle seemed to listen with magnetized attention it is all the more pathetic because this mental insufficiency is sometimes found in the good though there are i should imagine at least an equal number of opposite examples the person standing a few feet off us for example is both stupid and wicked but be very careful quoodle to remember that any disadvantage under which we place him should be based on the moral and not his mental defects should i say to you at any time go for him quoodle or hold him quoodle be certain in your own mind please that it is solely because he is wicked and not because he is stupid that i am entitled to do so the fact that he is stupid would not justify me in saying hold him quoodle with the realistic intonation i now employ curse you call him off cried mr bullrose retreating for quoodle was coming toward him with the bulldog part of his pedigree very prominently displayed like a pennon should mr bullrose find it expedient to climb a tree or even a signpost proceeded dalroy for indeed the agent had already clasped the pole of the old ship which was stouter than the slender trees standing just around it you will keep an eye on him quoodle and i doubt not constantly remind him that it is his wickedness and not as he might hastily be inclined to suppose stupidity that has placed him on so conspicuous an elevation some of youll wish yourself dead for this said the agent who was by this time clinging to the wooden sign like a monkey on a stick while quoodle watched him from below with an unsated interest some of youll see something here comes his lordship and the police i reckon good morning my lord said dalroy as ivywood paler than ever in the strong moonshine came through the thicket toward them it seemed to be his fate that his faultless and hueless face should always be contrasted with richer colours and even now it was thrown up by the gorgeous diplomatic uniform of dr gluck who walked just behind him i am glad to see you my lord said dalroy in a stately manner it is always so awkward doing business with an agent especially for the agent captain dalroy said lord ivywood with a more serious dignity i am sorry we meet again like this and such things are not of my seeking it is only right to tell you that the police will be here in a moment quite time too said dalroy shaking his head i never saw anything so disgraceful in my life of course i am sorry its a friend of yours and i hope the police will keep ivywood house out of the papers but i wont be a party to one law for the rich and another for the poor and it would be a great shame if a man in that state got off altogether merely because he had got the stuff at your house i do not understand you said ivywood what are you talking of why of him replied the captain with a genial gesture toward a fallen tree trunk that lay a yard or two from the tunnel wall the poor chap the police are coming for lord ivywood looked at the forest log by the tunnel which he had not glanced at before and in his pale eyes perhaps for the first time stood a simple astonishment above the log appeared two duplicate objects which after a prolonged stare he identified as the soles of a pair of patent leather shoes offered to his gaze as if demanding his opinion in the matter of resoling they were all that was visible of mr hibbs who had fallen backward off his woodland seat and seemed contented with his new situation his lordship put up the pincenez that made him look ten years older and said with a sharp steely accent what is all this the only effect of his voice upon the faithful hibbs was to cause him to feebly wave his legs in the air in recognition of a feudal superior he clearly considered it hopeless to attempt to get up so dalroy striding across to him lugged him up by his shirt collar and exhibited him limp and wildeyed to the company you wont want many policemen to take him to the station said the captain im sorry lord ivywood im afraid its no use your asking me to overlook it again we cant afford it and he shook his head implacably weve always kept a respectable house mr pump and i the old ship has a reputation all over the country in quite a lot of different parts in fact people in the oddest places have found it a quiet family house nothing gadabout in the old ship and if you think you can send all your staggering revellers captain dalroy said ivywood simply you seem to be under a misapprehension which i think it would be hardly honourable to leave undisturbed whatever these extraordinary events may mean and whatever be fitting in the case of this gentleman when i spoke of the police coming i meant they were coming for you and your confederate for me cried the captain with a stupendous air of surprise why i have never done anything naughty in my life you have been selling alcohol contrary to clause v of the act of but ive got a sign cried dalroy excitedly you told me yourself it was all right if id got a sign oh do look at our new sign the sign of the agile agent mr bullrose had remained silent feeling his position none of the most dignified and hoping his employer would go away but lord ivywood looked up at him and thought he had wandered into a planet of monsters as he slowly recovered himself patrick dalroy said briskly all quite correct and conventional you see you cant run us in for not having a sign weve rather an extra lifelike one and you cant run us in as rogues and vagabonds either visible means of subsistence and he slapped the huge cheese under his arm with his great flat hand so that it reverberated like a drum quite visible perceptible he added holding it out suddenly almost under lord ivywoods nose perceptible to the naked eye through your lordships eyeglasses he turned abruptly burst open the pantomime door behind him and bowled the big cheese down the tunnel with a noise like thunder which ended in a cry of acceptation in the distant voice of mr humphrey pump it was the last of their belongings left at this end of the tunnel and dalroy turned again a man totally transfigured and now ivywood he said what can i be charged with well i have a suggestion to make i will surrender to the police quite quietly when they come if you will do me one favour let me choose my crime i dont understand you answered the other coolly what crime what favour captain dalroy unsheathed the straight sword that still hung on his now shabby uniform the slender blade sparkled splendidly in the moonlight as he pointed it straight at dr gluck take away his sword from the little pawnbroker he said its about the length of mine or well change if you like give me ten minutes on that strip of turf and then it may be ivywood that i shall be removed from your public path in a way a little worthier of enemies who have once been friends than if you tripped me up with bow street runners of whose help every ancestor you have would have been ashamed or on the other hand it may be that when the police come there will be something to arrest me for there was a long silence and the elf of irresponsibility peeped out again for an instant in dalroys mind mr bullrose will see fair play for you from a throne above the lists he said i have already put my honour in the hands of mr hibbs i must decline captain dalroys invitation said ivywood at last in a curious tone not so much because before he could proceed leveson came racing across the copse hallooing the police are here dalroy who loved leaving everything to the last instant tore up the sign with bullrose literally hanging to it shook him off like a ripe fruit and then plunged into the tunnel the clamorous quoodle at his heels before even ivywood the promptest of his party could reach the spot he had clashed to the wood door and bolted it across with his wooden staple he had not had time even to sheath his sword break down this door said lord ivywood calmly i noticed they havent finished loading their cart under his directions and vastly against their will bullrose and leveson lifted the treetrunk vacated by hibbs and swinging it thrice as a batteringram burst in the door lord ivywood instantly sprang into the entrance a voice called out to him quietly from the other end of the tunnel there was something touching and yet terrible about a voice so human coming out of that inhuman darkness if philip ivywood had been really a poet and not rather its opposite an aesthete he would have known that all the past and people of england were uttering their oracle out of the cavern as it was he only heard a publican wanted by the police yet even he paused and indeed seemed spellbound my lord i would like a word i learned my catechism and never was with the radicals i want you to look at what youve done to me youve stolen a house that was mine as that ones yours youve made me a dirty tramp that was a man respected in church and market now you send me where i might have cells or the cat if i might make so bold what do you suppose i think of you do you think because you go up to london and settle it with lords in parliament and bring back a lot of papers and long words that makes any difference to the man you do it to by what i can see youre just a bad and cruel master like those god punished in the old days like squire varney the weasels killed in holy wood well parson always said one might shoot at robbers and i want to tell your lordship he ended respectfully that i have a gun ivywood instantly stepped into the darkness and spoke in a voice shaken with some emotion the nature of which was never certainly known the police are here he said but ill arrest you myself a shot shrieked and rattled through the thousand echoes of the tunnel lord ivywoods legs doubled and twisted under him and he collapsed on the earth with a bullet above his knee almost at the same instant a shout and a bark announced that the cart had started as a complete equipage it was even more than complete for the instant before it moved mr quoodle had sprung into it and as it was driven off sat erect in it looking solemn chapter xiv the creature that man forgets despite the natural hubbub round the wound of lord ivywood and the difficulties of the police in finding their way to the shore the fugitives of the flying inn must almost certainly have been captured but for a curious accident which also flowed as it happened from the great ivywood debate on vegetarianism the comparatively late hour at which lord ivywood had made his discovery had been largely due to a very long speech which joan had not heard and which was delivered immediately before the few concluding observations she had heard from dr gluck the speech was made by an eccentric of course most of those who attended and nearly all of those who talked were eccentric in one way or another but he was an eccentric of great wealth and good family an mp a jp a relation of lady enid a man well known in art and letters in short a personality who could not be prevented from being anything he chose from a revolutionist to a bore dorian wimpole had first become famous outside his own class under the fanciful title of the poet of the birds a volume of verse expanding the several notes or cries of separate songbirds into fantastic soliloquies of these feathered philosophers had really contained a great deal of ingenuity and elegance unfortunately he was one of those who always tend to take their own fancies seriously and in whose otherwise legitimate extravagance there is too little of the juice of jest hence in his later works when he explained the fable of the angel by trying to prove that the fowls of the air were creatures higher than man or the anthropoids his manner was felt to be too austere and when he moved an amendment to lord ivywoods scheme for the model village called peaceways urging that its houses should all follow the more hygienic architecture of nests hung in trees many regretted that he had lost his light touch but when he went beyond birds and filled his poems with conjectural psychology about all the zoological gardens his meaning became obscure and lady susan had even described it as his bad period it was all the more uncomfortable reading because he poured forth the imaginary hymns lovesongs and warsongs of the lower animals without a word of previous explanation thus if someone seeking for an ordinary drawingroom song came on lines that were headed a desert love song and which began her head is high against the stars her hump is heaved in pride the compliment to the lady would at first seem startling until the reader realised that all the characters in the idyll were camels or if he began a poem simply entitled the march of democracy and found in the first lines comrades marching evermore fix your teeth in floor and door he might be doubtful about such a policy for the masses until he discovered that it was supposed to be addressed by an eloquent and aspiring rat to the social solidarity of his race lord ivywood had nearly quarrelled with his poetic relative over the uproarious realism of the verses called a drinking song until it was carefully explained to him that the drink was water and that the festive company consisted of bisons his vision of the perfect husband as it exists in the feelings of the young female walrus is thoughtful and suggestive but would doubtless receive many emendations from anyone who had experienced those feelings and in his sonnet called motherhood he has made the young scorpion consistent and convincing yet somehow not wholly lovable in justice to him however it should be remembered that he attacked the most difficult cases on principle declaring that there was no earthly creature that a poet should forget he was of the blond type of his cousin with flowing fair hair and mustache and a bright blue absentminded eye he was very well dressed in the carefully careless manner with a brown velvet jacket and the image on his ring of one of those beasts men worshipped in egypt his speech was graceful and well worded and enormously long and it was all about an oyster he passionately protested against the suggestion of some humanitarians who were vegetarians in other respects but maintained that organisms so simple might fairly be counted as exceptions man he said even at his miserable best was always trying to excommunicate some one citizen of the cosmos to forget some one creature that he should remember now it seemed that creature was the oyster he gave a long account of the tragedy of the oyster a really imaginative and picturesque account full of fantastic fishes and coral crags crawling and climbing and bearded creatures streaking the seashore and the green darkness in the cellars of the sea what a horrid irony it is he cried that this is the only one of the lower creatures whom we call a native we speak of him and of him alone as if he were a native of the country whereas indeed he is an exile in the universe what can be conceived more pitiful than the eternal frenzy of the impotent amphibian what is more terrible than the tear of an oyster nature herself has sealed it with the hard seal of eternity the creature man forgets bears against him a testimony that cannot be forgotten for the tears of widows and of captives are wiped away at last like the tears of children they vanish like the mists of morning or the small pools after a flood but the tear of the oyster is a pearl the poet of the birds was so excited with his own speech that after the meeting he walked out with a wild eye to the motor car which had been long awaiting him the chauffeur giving some faint signs of relief toward home for the present said the poet and stared at the moon with an inspired face he was very fond of motoring finding it fed him with inspirations and he had been doing it from an early hour that morning having enjoyed a slightly lessened sleep he had scarcely spoken to anybody until he spoke to the cultured crowd at ivywood he did not wish to speak to anyone for many hours yet his ideas were racing he had thrown on a fur coat over his velvet jacket but he let it fly open having long forgotten the coldness in the splendour of the moonstruck night he realised only two things the swiftness of his car and the swiftness of his thoughts he felt as it were a fury of omniscience he seemed flying with every bird that sped or spun above the woods with every squirrel that had leapt and tumbled within them with every tree that had swung under and sustained the blast yet in a few moments he leaned forward and tapped the glass frontage of the car and the chauffeur suddenly squaring his shoulders jarringly stopped the wheels dorian wimpole had just seen something in the clear moonlight by the roadside which appealed both to this and to the other side of his tradition something that appealed to wimpole as well as to dorian two shabby looking men one in tattered gaiters and the other in what looked like the remains of fancy dress with the addition of hair of so wild a red that it looked like a wig were halted under the hedge apparently loading a donkey cart at least two rounded rudely cylindrical objects looking more or less like tubs stood out in the road beside the wheels along with a sort of loose wooden post that lay along the road beside them as a matter of fact the man in the old gaiters had just been feeding and watering the donkey and was now adjusting its harness more easily but dorian wimpole naturally did not expect that sort of thing from that sort of man there swelled up in him the sense that his omnipotence went beyond the poetical that he was a gentleman a magistrate an mp and jp and so on this callousness or ignorance about animals should not go on while he was a jp especially since ivywoods last act he simply strode across to the stationary cart and said you are overloading that animal and it is forfeited and you must come with me to the police station humphrey pump who was very considerate to animals and had always tried to be considerate to gentlemen in spite of having put a bullet into one of their legs was simply too astounded and distressed to make any answer at all he moved a step or two backward and stared with brown blinking eyes at the poet the donkey the cask the cheese and the signboard lying in the road but captain dalroy with the quicker recovery of his national temperament swept the poet and magistrate a vast fantastic bow and said with agreeable impudence interested in donkeys no doubt i am interested in all things men forget answered the poet with a fine touch of pride but mostly in those like this that are most easily forgotten somehow from those two first sentences pump realised that these two eccentric aristocrats had unconsciously recognised each other the fact that it was unconscious seemed somehow to exclude him all the more he stirred a little the moonlit dust of the road with his rather dilapidated boots and eventually strolled across to speak to the chauffeur is the next police station far from here he asked the chauffeur answered with one syllable of which the nearest literal rendering is dno other spellings have been attempted but the sentiment expressed is that of agnosticism but something of special brutality of abbreviation made the shrewd and therefore sensitive mr pump look at the mans face and he saw it was not only the moonlight that made it white with that dumb delicacy that was so english in him pump looked at the man again and saw he was leaning heavily on the car with one arm and saw that the arm was shaking he understood his countrymen enough to know that whatever he said he must say in a careless manner i hope its nearer to your place you must be a bit done up oh hell said the driver and spat on the road pump was sympathetically silent and mr wimpoles chauffeur broke out incoherently as if in another place blarsted beauties o dibrike and no breakfast blarsted lunch hivywood and no lunch blarsted black everlastin hours artside while e as is cike an champine and then its a dornkey you dont mean to say said pump in a very serious voice that youve had no food today ow no replied the cockney with the irony of the deathbed ow of course not pump strolled back into the road again picked up the cheese in his left hand and landed it on the seat beside the driver then his right hand went to one of his large loose equivocal pockets and the blade of a big jackknife caught and recaught the steady splendours of the moon the driver stared for several instants at the cheese with the knife shaking in his hand then he began to hack it and in that white witchlike light the happiness of his face was almost horrible pump was wise in all such things and knew that just as a little food will sometimes prevent sheer intoxication so a little stimulant will sometimes prevent sudden and dangerous indigestion it was practically impossible to make the man stop eating cheese it was far better to give him a very little of the rum especially as it was very good rum and better than anything he could find in any of the publichouses that were still permitted he walked across the road again and picked up the small cask which he put on the other side of the cheese and from which he filled in his own manner the little cup he carried in his pocket but at the sight of this the cockneys eyes lit at once with terror and desire but yer cawnt do it he whispered hoarsely its the pleece its gile for that with no doctors letter nor signboard nor nothink mr humphrey pump made yet another march back into the road when he got there he hesitated for the first time but it was quite clear from the attitude of the two insane aristocrats who were arguing and posturing in the road that they would notice nothing except each other he picked the loose post off the road and brought it to the car humorously propping it erect in the aperture between keg and cheese the little glass of rum was wavering in the poor chauffeurs hand exactly as the big knife had done but when he looked up and actually saw the wooden sign above him he seemed not so much to pluck up his courage but rather to drag up some forgotten courage from the foundations of some unfathomable sea it was indeed the forgotten courage of the people he looked once at the bleak black pinewoods around him and took the mouthful of golden liquid at a gulp as if it were a fairy potion he sat silent and then very slowly a sort of stony glitter began to come into his eyes the brown and vigilant eyes of humphrey pump were studying him with some anxiety or even fear he did look rather like a man enchanted or turned to stone but he spoke very suddenly the blighter he said ill give im ell ill give im bleeding ell ill give im somethink wot e dont expect what do you mean asked the innkeeper why answered the chauffeur with abrupt composure ill give im a little dornkey mr pump looked troubled do you think he observed affecting to speak lightly that hes fit to be trusted even with a little donkey ow yes said the man hes very amiable with donkeys and donkeys we is to be amiable with im pump still looked at him doubtfully appearing or affecting not to follow his meaning then he looked equally anxiously across at the other two men but they were still talking different as they were in every other way they were of the sort who forget everything class quarrel time place and physical facts in front of them in the lust of lucid explanation and equal argument thus when the captain began by lightly alluding to the fact that after all it was his donkey since he had bought it from a tinker for a just price the police station practically vanished from wimpoles mind and i fear the donkeycart also nothing remained but the necessity of dissipating the superstition of personal property i own nothing said the poet waving his hands outward i own nothing save in the sense that i own everything all depends whether wealth or power be used for or against the higher purposes of the cosmos indeed replied dalroy and how does your motor car serve the higher purposes of the cosmos it helps me said mr wimpole with honourable simplicity to produce my poems and if it could be used for some higher purpose if such a thing could be if some new purpose had come into the cosmoss head by accident inquired the other i suppose it would cease to be your property certainly replied the dignified dorian i should not complain nor have you any title to complain when the donkey ceases to be yours when you depress it in the cosmic scale what makes you think asked dalroy that i wanted to depress it it is my firm belief replied dorian wimpole sternly that you wanted to ride on it for indeed the captain had once repeated his playful gesture of putting his large leg across is not that so no answered the captain innocently i never ride on a donkey im afraid of it afraid of a donkey cried wimpole incredulously afraid of an historical comparison said dalroy there was a short pause and wimpole said coolly enough oh well weve outlived those comparisons easily answered the irish captain it is wonderful how easily one outlives someone elses crucifixion in this case said the other grimly i think it is the donkeys crucifixion why you must have drawn that old roman caricature of the crucified donkey said patrick dalroy with an air of some wonder how well you have worn why you look quite young well of course if this donkey is crucified he must be uncrucified but are you quite sure he added very gravely that you know how to uncrucify a donkey i assure you its one of the rarest of human arts all a matter of knack its like the doctors with the rare diseases you know the necessity so seldom arises granted that by the higher purposes of the cosmos i am unfit to look after this donkey i must still feel a faint shiver of responsibility in passing him on to you will you understand this donkey he is a delicateminded donkey he is a complex donkey how can i be certain that on so short an acquaintance you will understand every shade of his little likes and dislikes the dog quoodle who had been sitting as still as the sphinx under the shadow of the pine trees waddled out for an instant into the middle of the road and then returned he ran out when a slight noise as of rotatory grinding was heard and ran back when it had ceased but dorian wimpole was much too keen on his philosophical discovery to notice either dog or wheel i shall not sit on its back anyhow he said proudly but if that were all it would be a small matter it is enough for you that you have left it in the hands of the only person who could really understand it one who searches the skies and seas so as not to neglect the smallest creature this is a very curious creature said the captain anxiously he has all sorts of odd antipathies he cant stand a motor car for instance especially one that throbs like that while its standing still he doesnt mind a fur coat so much but if you wear a brown velvet jacket under it he bites you and you must keep him out of the way of a certain kind of people i dont suppose youve met them but they always think that anybody with less than two hundred a year is drunk and very cruel and that anybody with more than two thousand a year is conducting the day of judgment if you will keep our dear donkey from the society of such persons hullo hullo hullo he turned in genuine disturbance and dashed after the dog who had dashed after the motor car and jumped inside the captain jumped in after the dog to pull him out again but before he could do so he found the car was flying along too fast for any such leap he looked up and saw the sign of the old ship erect in the front like a rigid banner and pump with his cask and cheese sitting solidly beside the driver the thing was more of an earthquake and transformation to him even than to any of the others but he rose waveringly to his feet and shouted out to wimpole youve left it in the right hands ive never been cruel to a motor in the moonlight of the magic pinewood far behind dorian and the donkey were left looking at each other to the mystical mind when it is a mind at all which is by no means always the case there are no two things more impressive and symbolical than a poet and a donkey and the donkey was a very genuine donkey and the poet was a very genuine poet however lawfully he might be mistaken for the other animal at times the interest of the donkey in the poet will never be known the interest of the poet in the donkey was perfectly genuine and survived even that appalling private interview in the owlish secrecy of the woods but i think even the poet would have been enlightened if he had seen the white set frantic face of the man on the drivers seat of his vanishing motor if he had seen it he might have remembered the name or perhaps even begun to understand the nature of a certain animal which is neither the donkey nor the oyster but the creature whom man has always found it easiest to forget since the hour he forgot god in a garden chapter xv the songs of the car club more than once as the car flew through black and silver fairylands of fir wood and pine wood dalroy put his head out of the side window and remonstrated with the chauffeur without effect he was reduced at last to asking him where he was going im goin ome said the driver in an undecipherable voice im a goin ome to my mar and where does she live asked dalroy with something more like diffidence than he had ever shown before in his life wiles said the man but i aint seen er since i was born but shell do you must realise said dalroy with difficulty that you may be arrested its the mans own car and hes left behind with nothing to eat so to speak es got is dornkey grunted the man let the stinker eat is dornkey with thistle sauce e would if e was as ollow as i was humphrey pump opened the glass window that separated him from the rear part of the car and turned to speak to his friend over his square elbow and shoulder im afraid he said he wont stop for anything just yet hes as mad as moodys aunt as they say do they say it asked the captain with a sort of anxiety they never said it in ithaca honestly i think youd better leave him alone answered pump with his sagacious face hed just run us into a scotch express like dandy mutton did when they said he was driving carelessly we can send the car back to ivywood somehow later on and really i dont think itll do the gentleman any harm to spend a night with a donkey the donkey might teach him something i tell you its true he denied the principle of private property said dalroy reflectively but i fancy he was thinking of a plain house fixed on the ground a house on wheels such as this he might perhaps think a more permanent possession but i never understand it and again he passed a weary palm across his open forehead have you ever noticed hump what is really odd about those people the car shot on amid the comfortable silence of pump and then the irishman said again that poet in the pussycat clothes wasnt half bad lord ivywood isnt cruel but hes inhuman but that man wasnt inhuman he was ignorant like most cultured fellows but whats odd about them is that they try to be simple and never clear away a single thing thats complicated if they have to choose between beef and pickles they always abolish the beef if they have to choose between a meadow and a motor they forbid the meadow shall i tell you the secret these men only surrender the things that bind them to other men go and dine with a temperance millionaire and you wont find hes abolished the hors doeuvres or the five courses or even the coffee what hes abolished is the port and sherry because poor men like that as well as rich go a step farther and you wont find hes abolished the fine silver forks and spoons but hes abolished the meat because poor men like meat when they can get it go a step farther and you wont find he goes without gardens or gorgeous rooms which poor men cant enjoy at all but you will find he boasts of early rising because sleep is a thing poor men can still enjoy about the only thing they can still enjoy nobody ever heard of a modern philanthropist giving up petrol or typewriting or troops of servants no no what he gives up must be some simple and universal thing he will give up beef or beer or sleep because these pleasures remind him that he is only a man humphrey pump nodded but still answered nothing and the voice of the sprawling dalroy took one of its upward turns of a sort of soaring flippancy which commonly embodied itself in remembering some song he had composed such he said was the case of the late mr mandragon so long popular in english aristocratic society as a bluff and simple democrat from the west until he was unfortunately sandbagged by six men whose wives he had had shot by private detectives on his incautiously landing on american soil mr mandragon the millionaire he wouldnt have wine or wife he couldnt endure complexity he lived the simple life he ordered his lunch by megaphone in manly simple tones and used all his motors for canvassing voters and twenty telephones besides a dandy little machine cunning and neat as ever was seen with a hundred pulleys and cranks between made of iron and kept quite clean to hoist him out of his healthful bed on every day of his life and wash him and brush him and shave him and dress him to live the simple life mr mandragon was most refined and quietly neatly dressed say all the american newspapers that know refinement best quiet and neat the hair and hat and the coat quiet and neat a trouser worn upon either leg while boots adorned the feet and not as anyone might expect a tiger skin all striped and specked and a peacock hat with the tail erect a scarlet tunic with sunflowers decked that might have had a more marked effect and pleased the pride of a weaker man that yearned for wine or wife but fame and the flagon for mr mandragon obscured the simple life mr mandragon the millionaire i am happy to say is dead he enjoyed a quiet funeral in a crematorium shed and he lies there fluffy and soft and grey and certainly quite refined when he might have rotted to flowers and fruit with adam and all mankind or been eaten by bears that fancy blood or burnt on a big tall tower of wood in a towering flame as a heathen should or even sat with us here at food merrily taking twopenny rum and cheese with a pocket knife but these were luxuries lost for him that lived for the simple life mr pump had made many attempts to arrest this song but they were as vain as all attempts to arrest the car the angry chauffeur seemed indeed rather inspired to further energy by the violent vocal noises behind and pump again found it best to fall back on conversation well captain he said amicably i cant quite agree with you about those things of course you can trust foreigners too much as poor thompson did but then you can go too far the other way aunt sarah lost a thousand pounds that way i told her again and again he wasnt a nigger but she wouldnt believe me and of course that was just the kind of thing to offend an ambassador if he was an austrian it seems to me captain you arent quite fair to these foreign chaps take these americans now there were many americans went by pebblewick you may suppose but in all the lot there was never a bad lot never a nasty american nor a stupid american nor well never an american that i didnt rather like i know said dalroy you mean there was never an american who did not appreciate the old ship i suppose i do mean that answered the innkeeper and somehow i feel the old ship might appreciate the american too you english are an extraordinary lot said the irishman with a sudden and sombre quietude i sometimes feel you may pull through after all after another silence he said youre always right hump and one oughtnt to think of yankees like that the rich are the scum of the earth in every country and a vast proportion of the real americans are among the most courteous intelligent selfrespecting people in the world some attribute this to the fact that a vast proportion of the real americans are irishmen pump was still silent and the captain resumed in a moment all the same he said its very hard for a man especially a man of a small country like me to understand how it must feel to be an american especially in the matter of nationality i shouldnt like to have to write the american national anthem but fortunately there is no great probability of the commission being given the shameful secret of my inability to write an american patriotic song is one that will die with me well what about an english one said pump sturdily you might do worse captain english you bloody tyrant said patrick indignantly i could no more fancy a song by an englishman than you could one by that dog mr humphrey pump gravely took the paper from his pocket on which he had previously inscribed the sin and desolation of grocers and felt in another of his innumerable pockets for a pencil hullo cried dalroy are you going to have a shy at the ballad of quoodle quoodle lifted his ears at his name mr pump smiled a slight and embarrassed smile he was secretly proud of dalroys admiration for his previous literary attempts and he had some natural knack for verse as a game as he had for all games and his reading though desultory had not been merely rustic or low on condition he said deprecatingly that you write a song for the english oh very well said patrick with a huge sigh that really indicated the very opposite of reluctance we must do something till the thing stops i suppose and this seems a blameless parlour game songs of the car club sounds quite aristocratic and he began to make marks with a pencil on the flyleaf of a little book he had in his pocket wilsons noctes ambrosianae every now and then however he looked up and delayed his own composition by watching pump and the dog whose proceedings amused him very much for the owner of the old ship sat sucking his pencil and looking at mr quoodle with eyes of fathomless attention every now and then he slightly scratched his brown hair with the pencil and wrote down a word and the dog quoodle with that curious canine power of either understanding or most brazenly pretending to understand what is going on sat erect with his head at an angle as if he were sitting for his portrait hence it happened that though pumps poem was a little long as are often the poems of inexperienced poets and though dalroys poem was very short being much hurried toward the end the long poem was finished some time before the short one therefore it was that there was first produced for the world the song more familiarly known as no noses or more correctly called the song of quoodle part of it ran eventually thus they havent got no noses the fallen sons of eve even the smell of roses is not what they supposes but more than mind discloses and more than men believe they havent got no noses they cannot even tell when door and darkness closes the park a jew encloses where even the law of moses will let you steal a smell the brilliant smell of water the brave smell of a stone the smell of dew and thunder and old bones buried under are things in which they blunder and err if left alone the wind from winter forests the scent of scentless flowers the breath of brides adorning the smell of snare and warning the smell of sunday morning god gave to us for ours and quoodle here discloses all things that quoodle can they havent got no noses they havent got no noses and goodness only knowses the noselessness of man this poem also shows traces of haste in its termination and the present editor who has no aim save truth is bound to confess that parts of it were supplied in the criticisms of the captain and even enriched in later and livelier circumstances by the poet of the birds himself at the actual moment the chief features of this realistic song about dogs was a crashing chorus of bowwow wow begun by mr patrick dalroy but immediately imitated much more successfully by mr quoodle in the face of all this dalroy suffered some real difficulty in fulfilling the bargain by reading out his much shorter poem about what he imagined an englishman might feel indeed there was something very rough and vague in his very voice as he read it out as of one who had not found the key to his problem the present compiler who has no aim save truth must confess that the verses ran as follows st george he was for england and before he killed the dragon he drank a pint of english ale out of an english flagon for though he fast right readily in hairshirt or in mail it isnt safe to give him cakes unless you give him ale st george he was for england and right gallantly set free the lady left for dragons meat and tied up to a tree but since he stood for england and knew what england means unless you give him bacon you mustnt give him beans st george he was for england and shall wear the shield he wore when we go out in armour with the battlecross before but though he is jolly company and very pleased to dine it isnt safe to give him nuts unless you give him wine very philosophical song that said dalroy shaking his head solemnly full of deep thought i really think that is about the truth of the matter in the case of the englishman your enemies say youre stupid and you boast of being illogical which is about the only thing you do that really is stupid as if anybody ever made an empire or anything else by saying that two and two make five or as if anyone was ever the stronger for not understanding anything if it were only tipcat or chemistry but this is true about you hump you english are supremely an artistic people and therefore you go by associations as i said in my song you wont have one thing without the other thing that goes with it and as you cant imagine a village without a squire and parson or a college without port and old oak you get the reputation of a conservative people but its because youre sensitive hump not because youre stupid that you wont part with things its lies lies and flattery they tell you hump when they tell you youre fond of compromise i tell ye hump every real revolution is a compromise dye think wolfe tone or charles stuart parnell never compromised but its just because youre afraid of a compromise that you wont have a revolution if you really overhauled the old ship or oxford youd have to make up your mind what to take and what to leave and it would break your heart humphrey pump he stared in front of him with a red and ruminant face and at length added somewhat more gloomily this aesthetic way we have hump has only two little disadvantages which i will now explain to you the first is exactly what has sent us flying in this contraption when the beautiful smooth harmonious thing youve made is worked by a new type in a new spirit then i tell you it would be better for you a thousand times to be living under the thousand paper constitutions of condorcet and sieys when the english oligarchy is run by an englishman who hasnt got an english mind then you have lord ivywood and all this nightmare of which god could only guess the end the car had beaten some roods of dust behind it and he ended still more darkly and the other disadvantage my amiable aesthete is this if ever in blundering about the planet you come on an island in the atlantic atlantis let us say which wont accept all your pretty picture to which you cant give everything why you will probably decide to give nothing you will say in your hearts perhaps they will starve soon and you will become for that island the deafest and the most evil of all the princes of the earth it was already daybreak and pump who knew the english boundaries almost by intuition could tell even through the twilight that the tail of the little town they were leaving behind was of a new sort the sort to be seen in the western border the chauffeurs phrase about his mother might merely have been a musichall joke but certainly he had driven darkly in that direction white morning lay about the grey stony streets like spilt milk a few proletarian early risers wearier at morning than most men at night seemed merely of opinion that it was no use crying over it the two or three last houses which looked almost too tired to stand upright seemed to have moved the captain into another sleepy explosion there are two kinds of idealists as everybody knows or must have thought of there are those who idealize the real and those who precious seldom realise the ideal artistic and poetical people like the english generally idealize the real this i have expressed in a song which no really protested the innkeeper really now captain this i have expressed in a song repeated dalroy in an adamantine manner which i will now sing with every circumstance of leisure loudness or any other he stopped because the flying universe seemed to stop charging hedgerows came to a halt as if challenged by the bugle the racing forests stood rigid the last few tottering houses stood suddenly at attention for a noise like a pistolshot from the car itself had stopped all that race as a pistolshot might start any other the driver clambered out very slowly and stood about in various tragic attitudes round the car he opened an unsuspected number of doors and windows in the car and touched things and twisted things and felt things i must back as best i can to that there garrige sir he said in a heavy and husky tone they had not heard from him before then he looked round on the long woods and the last houses and seemed to gnaw his lip like a great general who has made a great mistake his brow seemed as black as ever yet his voice when he spoke again had fallen many further degrees toward its dull and daily tone yer see this is a bit bad he said itll be a beastly job even at the best plices if im gettin back at all getting back repeated dalroy opening the blue eyes of a bull back where well yer see said the chauffeur reasonably i was bloody keen to show im it was me drove the car and not im by a bit o bad luck i done damage to is car well if you can stick in is car captain patrick dalroy sprang out of the car so rapidly that he almost reeled and slipped upon the road the dog sprang after him barking furiously hump said patrick quietly ive found out everything about you i know what always bothered me about the englishman then after an instants silence he said that frenchman was right who said i forget how he put it that you march to trafalgar square to rid yourself of your temper not to rid yourself of your tyrant our friend was quite ready to rebel rushing away to rebel sitting still was too much for him do you read punch i am sure you do pump and punch must be almost the only survivors of the victorian age do you remember an old joke in an excellent picture representing two ragged irishmen with guns waiting behind a stone wall to shoot a landlord one of the irishmen says the landlord is late and adds i hope no accidents happened to the poor gentleman well its all perfectly true i knew that irishman intimately but i want to tell you a secret about him he was an englishman the chauffeur had backed with breathless care to the entrance of the garage which was next door to a milkmans or merely separated from it by a black and lean lane looking no larger than the crack of a door it must however have been larger than it looked because captain dalroy disappeared down it he seemed to have beckoned the driver after him at any rate that functionary instantly followed the functionary came out again in an almost guilty haste touching his cap and stuffing loose papers into his pocket then the functionary returned yet again from what he called the garrige carrying larger and looser things over his arm all this did mr humphrey pump observe not without interest the place remote as it was was evidently a rendezvous for motorists otherwise a very tall motorist throttled and masked in the most impenetrable degree would hardly have strolled up to speak to him still less would the tall motorist have handed him a similar horrid disguise of wraps and goggles in a bundle over his arm least of all would any motorist however tall have said to him from behind the cap and goggles put on these things hump and then well go into the milk shop im waiting for the car which car my seeker after truth why the car im going to buy for you to drive the remorseful chauffeur after many adventures did actually find his way back to the little moonlit wood where he had left his master and the donkey but his master and the donkey had vanished chapter xvi the seven moods of dorian that timeless clock of all lunatics which was so bright in the sky that night may really have had some elfin luck about it like a silver penny not only had it initiated mr hibbs into the mysteries of dionysius and mr bullrose into the arboreal habits of his ancestors but one night of it made a very considerable and rather valuable change in mr dorian wimpole the poet of the birds he was a man neither foolish nor evil any more than shelley only a man made sterile by living in a world of indirectness and insincerity with words rather than with things he had not had the smallest intention of starving his chauffeur he did not realise that there was worse spiritual murder in merely forgetting him but as hour after hour passed over him alone with the donkey and the moon he went through a raging and shifting series of frames of mind such as his cultured friends would have described as moods the first mood i regret to say was one of black and grinding hatred he had no notion of the chauffeurs grievance and could only suppose he had been bribed or intimidated by the demonic donkeytorturers but mr wimpole was much more capable at that moment of torturing a chauffeur than mr pump had ever been of torturing a donkey for no sane man can hate an animal he kicked the stones in the road sending them flying into the forest and wished that each one of them was a chauffeur the bracken by the roadside he tore up by the roots as representing the hair of the chauffeur to which it bore no resemblance he hit with his fist such trees as i suppose seemed in form and expression most reminiscent of the chauffeur but desisted from this finding that in this apparently onesided contest the tree had rather the best of it but the whole wood and the whole world had become a kind of omnipresent and pantheistic chauffeur and he hit at him everywhere the thoughtful reader will realise that mr wimpole had already taken a considerable upward stride in what he would have called the cosmic scale the next best thing to really loving a fellow creature is really hating him especially when he is a poorer man separated from you otherwise by mere social stiffness the desire to murder him is at least an acknowledgment that he is alive many a man has owed the first white gleams of the dawn of democracy in his soul to a desire to find a stick and beat the butler and we have it on the unimpeachable local authority of mr humphrey pump that squire merriman chased his librarian through three villages with a horsepistol and was a radical ever after his rage also did him good merely as a relief and he soon passed into a second and more positive mood of meditation the damnable monkeys go on like this he muttered and then they call a donkey one of the lower animals ride on a donkey would he id like to see the donkey riding on him for a bit good old man the patient ass turned mild eyes on him when he patted it and dorian wimpole discovered with a sort of subconscious surprise that he really was fond of the donkey deeper still in his subliminal self he knew that he had never been fond of an animal before his poems about fantastic creatures had been quite sincere and quite cold when he said he loved a shark he meant he saw no reason for hating a shark which was right enough there is no reason for hating a shark however much reason there may be for avoiding one there is no harm in a craken if you keep it in a tank or in a sonnet but he also realised that his love of creatures had been turned round and was working from the other end the donkey was a companion and not a monstrosity it was dear because it was near not because it was distant the oyster had attracted him because it was utterly unlike a man unless it be counted a touch of masculine vanity to grow a beard the fancy is no idler than that he had himself used in suggesting a sort of feminine vanity in the permanence of a pearl but in that maddening vigil among the mystic pines he found himself more and more drawn toward the donkey because it was more like a man than anything else around him because it had eyes to see and ears to hear and the latter even unduly developed he that hath ears to hear let him hear he said scratching those grey hairy flappers with affection havent you lifted your ears toward heaven and will you be the first to hear the last trumpet the ass rubbed his nose against him with what seemed almost like a human caress and dorian caught himself wondering how a caress from an oyster could be managed everything else around him was beautiful but inhuman only in the first glory of anger could he really trace in a tall pinetree the features of an extaxicabman from kennington trees and ferns had no living ears that they could wag nor mild eyes that they could move he patted the donkey again but the donkey had reconciled him to the landscape and in his third mood he began to realise how beautiful it was on a second study he was not sure it was so inhuman rather he felt that its beauty at least was half human that the aureole of the sinking moon behind the woods was chiefly lovely because it was like the tendercoloured aureole of an early saint and that the young trees were after all noble because they held up their heads like virgins cloudily there crowded into his mind ideas with which it was imperfectly familiar especially an idea which he had heard called the image of god it seemed to him more and more that all these things from the donkey to the very docks and ferns by the roadside were dignified and sanctified by their partial resemblance to something else it was as if they were baby drawings the wild crude sketches of nature in her first sketchbooks of stone he had flung himself on a pile of pineneedles to enjoy the gathering darkness of the pinewoods as the moon sank behind them there is nothing more deep and wonderful than really impenetrable pinewoods where the nearer trees show against the more shadowy a tracery of silver upon grey and of grey upon black it was by this time in pure pleasure and idleness that he picked up a pineneedle to philosophise about it think of sitting on needles he said yet i suppose this is the sort of needle that eve in the old legend used in eden aye and the old legend was right too think of sitting on all the needles in london think of sitting on all the needles in sheffield think of sitting on any needles except on all the needles of paradise oh yes the old legend was right enough the very needles of god are softer than the carpets of men he took a pleasure in watching the weird little forest animals creeping out from under the green curtains of the wood he reminded himself that in the old legend they had been as tame as the ass as well as being as comic he thought of adam naming the animals and said to a beetle i should call you budger the slugs gave him great entertainment and so did the worms he felt a new and realistic interest in them which he had not known before it was indeed the interest that a man feels in a mouse in a dungeon the interest of any man tied by the leg and forced to see the fascination of small things creatures of the wormy kind especially crept out at very long intervals yet he found himself waiting patiently for hours for the pleasure of their acquaintance one of them rather specially arrested his eye because it was a little longer than most worms and seemed to be turning its head in the direction of the donkeys left foreleg also it had a head to turn which most worms have not dorian wimpole did not know much about exact natural history except what he had once got up very thoroughly from an encyclopaedia for the purposes of a sympathetic vilanelle but as this information was entirely concerned with the conjectural causes of laughter in the hyena it was not directly helpful in this case but though he did not know much natural history he knew some he knew enough to know that a worm ought not to have a head and especially not a squared and flattened head shaped like a spade or a chisel he knew enough to know that a creeping thing with a head of that pattern survives in the english country sides though it is not common in short he knew enough to step across the road and set a sharp and savage bootheel on the neck and spine of the creature breaking it into three black bits that writhed once more before they stiffened then he gave out a great explosive sigh the donkey whose leg had been in such danger looked at the dead adder with eyes that had never lost their moony mildness even dorian himself looked at it for a long time and with feelings he could neither arrest nor understand before he remembered that he had been comparing the little wood to eden and even in eden he said at last and then the words of fitzgerald failed upon his lips and while he was warring with such words and thoughts something happened about him and behind him something he had written about a hundred times and read about a thousand something he had never seen in his life it flung faintly across the broad foliage a wan and pearly light far more mysterious than the lost moonshine it seemed to enter through all the doors and windows of the woodland pale and silent but confident like men that keep a tryst soon its white robes had threads of gold and scarlet and the name of it was morning for some time past loud and in vain all the birds had been singing to the poet of the birds but when that minstrel actually saw broad daylight breaking over wood and road the effect on him was somewhat curious he stood staring at it in gaping astonishment until it had fulfilled the fulness of its shining fate and the pinecones and the curling ferns and the live donkey and the dead viper were almost as distinct as they could be at noon or in a preraphaelite picture and then the fourth mood fell upon him like a bolt from the blue and he strode across and took the donkeys bridle as if to lead it along damn it all he cried in a voice as cheerful as the cockcrow that rang recently from the remote village its not everybody whos killed a snake then he added reflectively i bet dr gluck never did come along donkey lets have some adventures the finding and fighting of positive evil is the beginning of all fun and even of all farce all the wild woodland looked jolly now the snake was killed it was one of the fallacies of his literary clique to refer all natural emotions to literary names but it might not untruly be said that he had passed out of the mood of maeterlinck into the mood of whitman and out of the mood of whitman into the mood of stevenson he had not been a hypocrite when he asked for gilded birds of asia or purple polypi out of the southern seas he was not a hypocrite now when he asked for mere comic adventures along a common english road it was his misfortune and not his fault if his first adventure was his last and was much too comic to laugh at already the wan morning had warmed into a pale blue and was spotted with those little plump pink clouds which must surely have been the origin of the story that pigs might fly the insects of the grass chattered so cheerfully that every green tongue seemed to be talking the skyline on every side was broken only by objects that encouraged such swashbucklering comedy there was a windmill that chaucers miller might have inhabited or cervantess champion charged there was an old leaden church spire that might have been climbed by robert clive away toward pebblewick and the sea there were the two broken stumps of wood which humphrey pump declares to this day to have been the stands for an unsuccessful childrens swing but which tourists always accept as the remains of the antique gallows in the gaiety of such surroundings it is small wonder if dorian and the donkey stepped briskly along the road the very donkey reminded him of sancho panza he did not wake out of this boisterous reverie of the white road and the wind till a motor horn had first hooted and then howled till the ground had shaken with the shock of a stoppage and till a human hand fell heavily and tightly on his shoulder he looked up and saw the complete costume of a police inspector he did not worry about the face and there fell on him the fifth or unexpected mood which is called by the vulgar astonishment in despair he looked at the motor car itself that had anchored so abruptly under the opposite hedge the man at the steering wheel was so erect and unresponsive that dorian felt sure he was feasting his eyes on yet another policeman but on the seat behind was a very different figure a figure that baffled him all the more because he felt certain he had seen it somewhere the figure was long and slim with sloping shoulders and the costume which was untidy yet contrived to give the impression that it was tidy on other occasions the individual had bright yellow hair one lock of which stuck straight up and was exalted like the little horn in his favourite scriptures another tuft of it in a bright but blinding manner fell across and obscured the left optic as in literal fulfilment of the parable of a beam in the eye the eyes with or without beams in them looked a little bewildered and the individual was always nervously resettling his necktie for the individual went by the name of hibbs and had only recently recovered from experiences wholly new to him what on earth do you want asked wimpole of the policeman his innocent and startled face and perhaps other things about his appearance evidently caused the inspector to waver well its about this ere donkey sir he said do you think i stole it cried the indignant aristocrat well of all the mad worlds a pack of thieves steal my limousine i save their damned donkeys life at the risk of my own and im run in for stealing the clothes of the indignant aristocrat probably spoke louder than his tongue the officer dropped his hand and after consulting some papers in his hand walked across to consult with the unkempt gentleman in the car that seems to be a similar cart and donkey dorian heard him saying but the clothes dont seem to fit your description of the men you saw now mr hibbs had extremely vague and wild recollections of the men he saw he could not even tell what he had done and what he had merely dreamed if he had spoken sincerely he would have described a sort of green nightmare of forests in which he found himself in the power of an ogre about twelve feet high with scarlet flames for hair and dressed rather like robin hood but a long course of what is known as keeping the party together had made it as unnatural to him to tell anyone even himself what he really thought about anything as it would have been to spit or to sing he had at present only three motives and strong resolves not to admit that he had been drunk not to let anyone escape whom lord ivywood might possibly want to question and not to lose his reputation for sagacity and tact this party has a brown velvet suit you see and a fur overcoat the inspector continued and in the notes i have from you you say the man wore a uniform when we say uniform said mr hibbs frowning intellectually when we say uniform of course we must distinguish some of our friends who dont quite see eye to eye with us you know and he smiled with tender leniency some of our friends wouldnt like it called a uniform perhaps but of course well it wasnt a police uniform for instance ha ha i should hope not said the official shortly so in a way however said hibbs clutching his verbal talisman at last it might be brown velvet in the dark the inspector replied to this helpful suggestion with some wonder but it was a moon like limelight he protested yars yars cried hibbs in a high tone that can only be described as a hasty drawl yars discolours everything of course the flowers and things but look here said the inspector you said the principal mans hair was red a blond type a blond type said hibbs waving his hand with a solemn lightness reddish yellowish brownish sort of hair you know then he shook his head and said with the heaviest solemnity the word was capable of carrying teutonic purely teutonic the inspector began to feel some wonder that even in the confusion following on lord ivywoods fall he had been put under the guidance of this particular guide the truth was that leveson once more masking his own fears under his usual parade of hurry had found hibbs at a table by an open window with wild hair and sleepy eyes picking himself up with some sort of medicine finding him already fairly clearheaded in a dreary way he had not scrupled to use the remains of his bewilderment to despatch him with the police in the first pursuit even the mind of a semirecovered drunkard he thought could be trusted to recognise anyone so unmistakable as the captain but though the diplomatists debauch was barely over his strange soft fear and cunning were awake he felt fairly certain the man in the fur coat had something to do with the mystery as men with fur coats do not commonly wander about with donkeys he was afraid of offending lord ivywood and at the same time afraid of exposing himself to a policeman you have large discretion he said gravely very right you should have large discretion in the interests of the public i think you would be quite authorised for the present in preventing the mans escape and the other man inquired the officer with knitted brow do you suppose he has escaped the other man repeated hibbs however regarding the distant windmill through halfclosed lids as if this were a new fine shade introduced into an already delicate question well hang it all said the police officer you must know whether there were two men or one gradually it dawned in a grey dawn of horror over the brain of hibbs that this was what he specially couldnt know he had always heard and read in comic papers that a drunken man sees double and beholds two lampposts one of which is as the higher critic would have said purely subjective for all he knew being a mere novice inebriation might produce the impression of the two men of his dreamlike adventure when in truth there had only been one two men you know one man he said with a sort of moody carelessness well we can go into their numbers later they cant have a very large following here he shook his head very firmly quite impossible and as the late lord goschen used to say you can prove anything by statistics and here came an interruption from the other side of the road and how long am i to wait here for you and your goschens you silly goat were the intemperate woodnotes issuing from the poet of the birds im shot if ill stand this come along donkey and lets pray for a better adventure next time these are very inferior specimens of your own race and seizing the bridle of the ass again he strode past them swiftly and almost as if urging the animal to a gallop unfortunately this disdainful dash for liberty was precisely what was wanting to weigh down the rocking intelligence of the inspector on the wrong side if wimpole had stood still a minute or two longer the official who was no fool might have ended in disbelieving hibbss story altogether as it was there was a scuffle not without blows on both sides and eventually the honourable dorian wimpole donkey and all was marched off to the village in which there was a police station in which was a temporary cell in which a sixth mood was experienced his complaints however were at once so clamorous and so convincing and his coat was so unquestionably covered with fur that after some questioning and cross purposes they agreed to take him in the afternoon to ivywood house where there was a magistrate incapacitated by a shot only recently extracted from his leg they found lord ivywood lying on a purple ottoman in the midst of his chinese puzzle of oriental apartments he continued to look away as they entered as if expecting with roman calm the entrance of a recognised enemy but lady enid wimpole who was attending to the wants of the invalid gave a sharp cry of astonishment and the next moment the three cousins were looking at each other one could almost have guessed they were cousins all being as mr hibbs subtly put it a blond type but two of the blond types expressed amazement and one blond type merely rage i am sorry dorian said ivywood when he had heard the whole story these fanatics are capable of anything i fear and you very rightly resent their stealing your car you are wrong philip answered the poet emphatically i do not even faintly resent their stealing my car what i do resent is the continued existence on gods earth of this fool pointing to the serious hibbs and of that fool pointing to the inspector and yes by thunder of that fool too and he pointed straight at lord ivywood and i tell you frankly philip if there really are as you say two men who are bent on smashing your schemes and making your life a hell i am very happy to put my car at their disposal and now im off youll stop to dinner inquired ivywood with frigid forgiveness no thanks said the disappearing bard im going up to town the seventh mood of dorian wimpole had a grand finale at the caf royal and consisted largely of oysters chapter xvii the poet in parliament during the singular entrance and exit of dorian wimpole mp jp etc lady joan was looking out of the magic casements of that turret room which was now literally and not only poetically the last limit of ivywood house the old broken hole and black staircase up which the lost dog quoodle used to come and go had long ago been sealed up and cemented with a wall of exquisite eastern workmanship all through the patterns lord ivywood had preserved and repeated the principle that no animal shape must appear but like all lucid dogmatists he perceived all the liberties his dogma allowed him and he had irradiated this remote end of ivywood with sun and moon and solar and starry systems with the milky way for a dado and a few comets for comic relief the thing was well done of its kind as were all the things that philip ivywood got done for him and if all the windows of the turret were closed with their peacock curtains a poet with anything like a hibbsian appreciation of the family champagne might almost fancy he was looking out across the sea on a night crowded with stars and what was yet more important even misysra that exact thinker could not call the moon a live animal without falling into idolatry but joan looking out of real windows on a real sky and sea thought no more about the astronomical wallpaper than about any other wallpaper she was asking herself in sullen emotionalism and for the thousandth time a question she had never been able to decide it was the final choice between an ambition and a memory and there was this heavy weight in the scale that the ambition would probably materialise and the memory probably wouldnt it has been the same weight in the same scale a million times since satan became the prince of this world but the evening stars were strengthening over the old seashore and they also wanted weighing like diamonds as once before at the same stage of brooding she heard behind her the swish of lady enids skirts that never came so fast save for serious cause joan please do come nobody but you i do believe could move him joan looked at lady enid and realised that the lady was close on crying she turned a trifle pale and asked quietly for the question philip says hes going to london now with that leg and all cried enid and he wont let us say a word but how did it all happen asked joan lady enid wimpole was quite incapable of explaining how it all happened so the task must for the moment devolve on the author the simple fact was that ivywood in the course of turning over magazines on his sofa happened to look at a paper from the midlands the turkish news said mr leveson rather nervously is on the other side of the page but lord ivywood continued to look at the side of the paper that did not contain the turkish news with the same dignity of lowered eyelids and unconscious brow with which he had looked at the captains message when joan found him by the turret on the page covered merely with casual provincial happenings was a paragraph echo of pebblewick mystery reported reappearance of the vanishing inn underneath was printed in smaller letters an almost incredible report from wyddington announces that the mysterious sign of the old ship has once more been seen in this country though it has long been relegated by scientific investigators to the limbo of old rustic superstitions according to the local version mr simmons a dairyman of wyddington was serving in his shop when two motorists entered one of them asking for a glass of milk they were in the most impenetrable motoring panoply with darkened goggles and waterproof collars turned up so that nothing can be recalled of them personally except that one was a person of unusual stature in a few moments this latter individual went out of the shop again and returned with a miserable specimen out of the street one of the tattered loafers that linger about our most prosperous towns tramping the streets all night and even begging in defiance of the police the filth and disease of the creature were so squalid that mr simmons at first refused to serve him with the glass of milk which the taller motorist wished to provide for him at length however mr simmons consented and was immediately astonished by an incident against which he certainly had a more assured right to protest the taller motorist saying to the loafer but man youre blue in the face made a species of signs to the smaller motorist who thereupon appears to have pierced a sort of cylindrical trunk or chest that seemed to be his only luggage and drawn from it a few drops of a yellow liquid which he deliberately dropped into the ragged creatures milk it was afterward discovered to be rum and the protests of mr simmons may be imagined the tall motorist however warmly defended his action having apparently some wild idea that he was doing an act of kindness why i found the man nearly fainting he said if youd picked him off a raft he couldnt be more collapsed with cold and sickness and if youd picked him off a raft youd have given him rum yes by st patrick if you were a bloody pirate and made him walk the plank afterward mr simmons replied with dignity that he did not know how it was with rafts and could not permit such language in his shop he added that he would lay himself open to a police prosecution if he permitted the consumption of alcohol in his shop since he did not display a sign the motorist then made the amazing reply but you do display a sign you jolly old man did you think i couldnt find my way to the sign of the old ship you sly boots mr simmons was now fully convinced of the intoxication of his visitors and refusing a glass of rum rather boisterously offered him went outside his shop to look round for a policeman to his surprise he found the officer engaged in dispersing a considerable crowd which was staring up at some object behind him on looking round he states in his deposition he saw what was undoubtedly one of the low tavern signs at one time common in england he was wholly unable to explain its presence outside his premises and as it undoubtedly legalised the motorists action the police declined to move in the matter later the two motorists have apparently left the town unmolested in a small secondhand twoseater there is no clue to their destination except it be indicated by a single incident it appears that when they were waiting for the second glass of milk one of them drew attention to a milk can of a shape seemingly unfamiliar to him which was of course the mountain milk now so much recommended by doctors the taller motorist who seemed in every way strangely ignorant of modern science and social life asked his companion where it came from receiving of course the reply that it is manufactured in the model village of peaceways under the personal superintendence of its distinguished and philanthropic inventor dr meadows upon this the taller person who appeared highly irresponsible actually bought the whole can observing as he tucked it under his arm that it would help him to remember the address later our readers will be glad to hear that the legend of the old ship sign has once more yielded to the wholesome scepticism of science our representative reached wyddington after the practical jokers or whatever they were had left but he searched the whole frontage of mr simmonss shop and we are in a position to assure the public that there is no trace of the alleged sign lord ivywood laid down the newspaper and looked at the rich and serpentine embroideries on the wall with the expression that a great general might have if he saw a chance of really ruining his enemy if he would also ruin all his previous plan of campaign his pallid and classic profile was as immovable as a cameo but anyone who had known him at all would have known that his brain was going like a motor car that has broken the speed limit long ago then he turned his head and said please tell hicks to bring round the long blue car in half an hour it can be fitted up for a sofa and ask the gardener to cut a pole of about four feet nine inches and put a crosspiece for a crutch im going up to london tonight mr levesons lower jaw literally fell with astonishment the doctor said three weeks he said if i may ask it where are you going st stephens westminster answered ivywood surely said mr leveson i could take a message you could take a message assented ivywood im afraid they would not allow you to make a speech it was a moment or two afterward that enid wimpole had come into the room and striven in vain to shake his decision then it was that joan had been brought out of the turret and saw philip standing sustained upon a crutch of garden timber and admired him as she had never admired him before while he was being helped downstairs while he was being propped in the car with such limited comfort as was possible she did really feel in him something worthy of his ancient roots worthy of such hills and of such a sea for she felt gods wind from nowhere which is called the will and is mans only excuse upon this earth in the small toot of the starting motor she could hear a hundred trumpets such as might have called her ancestors and his to the glories of the third crusade such imaginary military honours were not at least in the strategic sense undeserved lord ivywood really had seen the whole map of the situation in front of him and swiftly formed a plan to meet it in a manner not unworthy of napoleon the realities of the situation unrolled themselves before him and his mind was marking them one by one as with a pencil first he knew that dalroy would probably go to the model village it was just the sort of place he would go to he knew dalroy was almost constitutionally incapable of not kicking up some kind of row in a place of that kind second he knew that if he missed dalroy at this address it was very likely to be his last address he and mr pump were quite clever enough to leave no more hints behind third he guessed by careful consideration of map and clock that they could not get to so remote a region in so cheap a car under something like two days nor do anything very conclusive in less than three thus he had just time to turn round in fourth he realised that ever since that day when dalroy swung round the signboard and smote the policeman into the ditch dalroy had swung round the ivywood act on lord ivywood he lord ivywood had thought and might well have thought rightly that by restricting the old signposts to a few places so select that they can afford to be eccentric and forbidding such artistic symbols to all other places he could sweep fermented liquor for all practical purposes out of the land the arrangement was exactly that at which all such legislation is consciously or unconsciously aiming a signboard could be a favour granted by the governing class to itself if a gentleman wished to claim the liberties of a bohemian the path would be open if a bohemian wished to claim the liberties of a gentleman the path would be shut so gradually lord ivywood had thought the old signs which can alone sell alcohol will dwindle down to mere curiosities like audit ale or the mead that may still be found in the new forest the calculation was by no means unstatesmanlike but like many other statesmanlike calculations it did not take into account the idea of dead wood walking about so long as his flying foes might set up their sign anywhere it mattered little whether the result was enjoyment or disappointment for the populace in either case it must mean constant scandal or riot if there was one thing worse than the appearance of the old ship it was its disappearance he realised that his own law was letting them loose every time for the local authorities hesitated to act on the spot in defiance of a symbol now so exclusive and therefore impressive he realised that the law must be altered must be altered at once must be altered if possible before the fugitives broke away from the model village of peaceways he realised that it was thursday this was the day on which any private member of parliament could introduce any private bill of the kind called noncontentious and pass it without a division so long as no particular member made any particular fuss he realised that it was improbable that any particular member would make any particular fuss about lord ivywoods own improvement on lord ivywoods own act finally he realised that the whole case could be met by so slight an improvement as this change the words of the act which he knew by heart as happier men might know a song if such sign be present liquids containing alcohol can be sold on the premises to these other words liquids containing alcohol can be sold if previously preserved for three days on the premises it was mate in a few moves parliament could never reject or even examine so slight an emendation and the revolution of the old ship and the late king of ithaca would be crushed for ever it does undoubtedly show as we have said something napoleonic in the mans mind that the whole of this excellent and even successful plan was complete long before he saw the great glowing clock on the towers of westminster and knew he was in time it was unfortunate perhaps that about the same time or not long after another gentleman of the same rank and indirectly of the same family having left the restaurant in regent street and the tangle of piccadilly had drifted serenely down whitehall and had seen the same great golden goblins eye on the tall tower of st stephen the poet of the birds like most aesthetes had known as little of the real town as he had of the real country but he had remembered a good place for supper and as he passed certain great cold clubs built of stone and looking like assyrian sarcophagi he remembered that he belonged to many of them and so when he saw afar off sitting above the river what has been very erroneously described as the best club in london he suddenly remembered that he belonged to that too he could not at the moment recall what constituency in south england it was that he sat for but he knew he could walk into the place if he wanted to he might not so have expressed the matter but he knew that in an oligarchy things go by respect for persons and not for claims by visiting cards and not by voting cards he had not been near the place for years being permanently paired against a famous patriot who had accepted an important government appointment in a private madhouse even in his silliest days he had never pretended to feel any respect for modern politics and made all haste to put his leaders and the mad patriots leaders on the well selected list of the creatures whom man forgets he had made one really eloquent speech in the house on the subject of gorillas and then found he was speaking against his party it was an indescribable sort of place anyhow even lord ivywood did not go to it except to do some business that could be done nowhere else as was the case that night ivywood was what is called a peer by courtesy his place was in the commons and for the time being on the opposition side but though he visited the house but seldom he knew far too much about it to go into the chamber itself he limped into the smoking room though he did not smoke procured a needless cigarette and a muchneeded sheet of notepaper and composed a curt but careful note to the one member of the government whom he knew must be in the house having sent it up to him he waited outside mr dorian wimpole also waited leaning on the parapet of westminster bridge and looking down the river he was becoming one with the oysters in a more solemn and solid sense than he had hitherto conceived possible and also with a strictly vegetarian beverage which bears the noble and starry name of nuits he felt at peace with all things even in a manner with politics it was one of those magic hours of evening when the red and golden lights of men are already lit along the river and look like the lights of goblins but daylight still lingers in a cold and delicate green he felt about the river something of that smiling and glorious sadness which two englishmen have expressed under the figure of the white wood of an old ship fading like a phantom turner in painting and henry newbolt in poetry he had come back to earth like a man fallen from the moon he was at bottom not only a poet but a patriot and a patriot is always a little sad yet his melancholy was mixed up with that immutable yet meaningless faith which few englishmen even in modern times fail to feel at the unexpected sight either of westminster or of that height on which stands the temple of st paul while flows the sacred river while stands the sacred hill he murmured in some schoolboy echo of the ballad of lake regillus while flows the sacred river while stands the sacred hill the proud old pantaloons and nincompoops who yawn at the very length of their own lies in that accursed sanhedrim where people put each others hats on in a poisonous room with no more windows than hell shall have such honour still relieved by this rendering of macaulay in the style known among his cultured friends as vers libre or poesy set free from the shackles of formal metre he strolled toward the members entrance and went in lacking lord ivywoods experience he strolled into the commons chamber itself and sat down on a green bench under the impression that the house was not sitting he was however gradually able to distinguish some six or eight drowsy human forms from the seats on which they sat and to hear a senile voice with an essex accent saying all on one note and without beginning or end in a manner which it is quite impossible to punctuate no wish at all that this proposal should be regarded except in the right way and have tried to put it in the right way and cannot think the honourable member was altogether adding to his reputation in putting it in what those who think with me must of course consider the wrong way and i for one am free to say that if in his desire to settle this great question he takes this hasty course and this revolutionary course about slate pencils he may not be able to prevent the extremists behind him from applying it to lead pencils and while i should be the last to increase the heat and the excitement and the personalities of this debate if i could possibly help it i must confess that in my opinion the honourable gentleman has himself encouraged that heat and personality in a manner that he now doubtless regrets i have no desire to use abusive terms indeed you mr speaker would not allow me of course to use abusive terms but i must tell the honourable member face to face that the perambulators with which he has twitted me cannot be germane to this discussion i should be the last person dorian wimpole had softly risen to go when he was arrested by the sight of someone sliding into the house and handing a note to the solitary young man with heavy eyelids who was at that moment governing all england from the treasury bench seeing him go out dorian had a sickening sweetness of hope as he might have said in his earlier poems that something intelligible might happen after all and followed him out almost with alacrity the solitary and sleepy governor of great britain went down into the lower crypts of its temple of freedom and turned into an apartment where wimpole was astonished to see his cousin ivywood sitting at a little table with a large crutch leaning beside him as serene as long john silver the young man with the heavy eyelids sat down opposite him and they had a conversation which wimpole of course did not hear he withdrew into an adjoining room where he managed to procure coffee and a liqueur an excellent liqueur which he had forgotten and of which he had more than one glass but he had so posted himself that ivywood could not come out without passing him and he waited for what might happen with exquisite patience the only thing that seemed to him queer was that every now and then a bell rang in several rooms at once and whenever the bell rang lord ivywood nodded as if he were part of the electrical machinery and whenever lord ivywood nodded the young man turned and sped upstairs like a mountaineer returning in a short time to resume the conversation on the third occasion the poet began to observe that many others from the other rooms could be heard running upstairs at the sound of this bell and returning with the slightly less rapid step which expresses relief after a duty done yet did he not know that this duty was representative government and that it is thus that the cry of cumberland or cornwall can come to the ears of an english king suddenly the sleepy young man sprang erect uninspired by any bell and strode out once more the poet could not help hearing him say as he left the table jotting down something with a pencil alcohol can be sold if previously preserved for three days on the premises i think we can do it but you cant come on for half an hour saying this he darted upstairs again and when dorian saw ivywood come out laboriously afterward on his large country crutch he had exactly the same revulsion in his favour that joan had had jumping up from his table which was in one of the private diningrooms he touched the other on the elbow and said i want to apologise to you philip for my rudeness this afternoon honestly i am sorry pinewoods and prisoncells try a mans temper but i had no rag of excuse for not seeing that for neither of them were you to blame id no notion you were coming up to town tonight with your leg and all you mustnt knock yourself up like this do sit down a minute it seemed to him that the bleak face of philip softened a little how far he really softened will never be known until such men as he are understood by their fellows it is certain that he carefully unhooked himself from his crutch and sat down opposite his cousin whereupon his cousin struck the table so that it rang like a dinnerbell and called out waiter as if he were in a crowded restaurant then before lord ivywood could protest he said its awfully jolly that weve met i suppose youve come up to make a speech i should like to hear it we havent always agreed but by god if theres anything good left in literature its your speeches reported in a newspaper that thing of yours that ended death and the last shutting of the iron doors of defeat why you must go back to straffords last speech for such english do let me hear your speech ive got a seat upstairs you know if you wish it said ivywood hurriedly but i shant make much of a speech tonight and he looked at the wall behind wimpoles head with thunderous wrinkles thickening on his brow it was essential to his brilliant and rapid scheme of course that the commons should make no comment at all on his little alteration in the law an attendant hovered near in response to the demand for a waiter and was much impressed by the presence and condition of lord ivywood but as that exalted cripple resolutely refused anything in the way of liquor his cousin was so kind as to have a little more himself and resumed his remarks its about this publichouse affair of yours i suppose id like to hear you speak on that praps ill speak myself ive been thinking about it a good deal all day and a good deal of last night too now heres what i should say to the house if i were you to begin with can you abolish the publichouse are you important enough now to abolish the publichouse whether its right or wrong can you in the long run prevent haymakers having ale any more than you can prevent me having this glass of chartreuse the attendant hearing the word once more drew near but heard no further order or rather the orders he heard were such as he was less able to cope with remember the curate said dorian abstractedly shaking his head at the functionary remember the sensible little highchurch curate who when asked for a temperance sermon preached on the text suffer us not to be overwhelmed in the waterfloods indeed indeed philip you are in deeper waters than you know you will abolish ale you will make kent forget hoppoles and devonshire forget cider the fate of the inn is to be settled in that hot little room upstairs take care its fate and yours are not settled in the inn take care englishmen dont sit in judgment on you as they do on many another corpse at an inquest at a common publichouse take care that the one tavern that is really neglected and shut up and passed like a house of pestilence is not the tavern in which i drink tonight and that merely because it is the worst tavern on the kings highway take care this place where we sit does not get a name like any pub where sailors are hocussed or girls debauched that is what i shall say to them said he rising cheerfully thats what i shall say see you to it he cried with sudden passion and apparently to the waiter see you to it if the sign that is destroyed is not the sign of the old ship but the sign of the mace and bauble and in the words of a highly historical brewer if we see a dog bark at your going lord ivywood was observing him with a deathly quietude another idea had come into his fertile mind he knew his cousin though excited was not in the least intoxicated he knew he was quite capable of making a speech and even a good one he knew that any speech good or bad would wreck his whole plan and send the wild inn flying again but the orator had resumed his seat and drained his glass passing a hand across his brow and he remembered that a man who keeps a vigil in a wood all night and drinks wine on the following evening is liable to an accident that is not drunkenness but something much healthier i suppose your speech will come on pretty soon said dorian looking at the table youll let me know when it does of course really and truly i dont want to miss it and ive forgotten all the ways here and feel pretty tired youll let me know yes said lord ivywood stillness fell along all the rooms until lord ivywood broke it by saying debate is a most necessary thing but there are times when it rather impedes than assists parliamentary government he received no reply dorian still sat as if looking at the table but his eyelids had lightly fallen he was asleep almost at the same moment the member of government who was nearly asleep appeared at the entrance of the long room and made some sort of weary signal philip ivywood raised himself on his crutch and stood for a moment looking at the sleeping man then he and his crutch trailed out of the long room leaving the sleeping man behind nor was that the only thing that he left behind he also left behind an unlighted cigarette and his honour and all the england of his fathers everything that could really distinguish that high house beside the river from any tavern for the hocussing of sailors he went upstairs and did his business in twenty minutes in the only speech he had ever delivered without any trace of eloquence and from that hour forth he was the naked fanatic and could feed on nothing but the future chapter xviii the republic of peaceways in a hamlet round about windermere let us say or somewhere in wordsworths country there could be found a cottage in which could be found a cottager so far all is as it should be and the visitor would first be conscious of a hearty and even noisy elderly man with an apple face and a short white beard this person would then loudly proffer to the visitor the opportunity of seeing his father a somewhat more elderly man with a somewhat longer white beard but still up and about and these two together would then initiate the neophyte into the joys of the society of a grandfather who was more than a hundred years old and still very proud of the fact this miracle it seemed had been worked entirely on milk the subject of this diet the oldest of the three men continued to discuss in enormous detail for the rest it might be said that his pleasures were purely arithmetical some men count their years with dismay and he counted his with a juvenile vanity some men collect stamps or coins and he collected days newspaper men interviewed him about the historic times through which he had lived without eliciting anything whatever except that he had apparently taken to an exclusive milk diet at about the age when most of us leave it off asked if he was alive in he said that was the very year he found it wasnt any milk but must be mountain milk like dr meadows says nor would his calculating creed of life have allowed him to understand you if you had said that in a meadowland oversea that lies before the city of brussels boys of his old school in that year gained the love of the gods and died young it was the philanthropic dr meadows of course who discovered this deathless tribe and erected on it the whole of his great dietetic philosophy to say nothing of the houses and dairies of peaceways he attracted many pupils and backers among the wealthy and influential young men who were so to speak training for extreme old age infant old men embryo nonagenarians it would be an exaggeration to say that they watched joyfully for the first white hair as fascination fledgeby watched for his first whisker but it is quite true to say that they seemed to have scorned the beauty of woman and the feasting of friends and above all the old idea of death with glory in comparison with this vision of the sports of second childhood peaceways was in its essential plan much like what we call a garden city a ring of buildings where the work people did their work with a pretty ornamental town in the centre where they lived in the open country outside this was no doubt much healthier than the factory system in the great towns and may have partly accounted for the serene expression of dr meadows and his friends if any part of the credit can be spared from the splendours of mountain milk the place lay far from the common highways of england and its inhabitants were enabled to enjoy their quiet skies and level woods almost undisturbed and fully absorb whatever may be valuable in the meadows method and view until one day a small and very dirty motor drove into the middle of their town it stopped beside one of those triangular islets of grass that are common at forked roads and two men in goggles one tall and the other short got out and stood on the central space of grass as if they were buffoons about to do tricks as indeed they were before entering the town they had stopped by a splendid mountain stream quickening and thickening rapidly into a river unhelmed and otherwise eased themselves eaten a little bread bought at wyddington and drank the water of the widening current which opened on the valley of peaceways im beginning quite to like water said the taller of the two knights i used to think it a most dangerous drink in theory of course it ought only to be given to people who are fainting its really good for them much better than brandy besides think of wasting good brandy on people who are fainting but i dont go so far as i did i shouldnt insist on a doctors prescription before i allow people water that was the too severe morality of youth that was my innocence and goodness i thought that if i fell once waterdrinking might become a habit but i do see the good side of water now how good it is when youre really thirsty how it glitters and gurgles how alive it is after all its the best of drinks after the other as it says in the song feast on wine or fast on water and your honour shall stand sure god almightys son and daughter he the valiant she the pure if an angel out of heaven brings you other things to drink thank him for his kind intentions go and pour them down the sink tea is like the east he grows in a great yellow mandarin with urbanity of manner and unconsciousness of sin all the women like a harem at his pigtail troop along and like all the east he grows in he is poison when hes strong tea although an oriental is a gentleman at least cocoa is a cad and coward cocoa is a vulgar beast cocoa is a dull disloyal lying crawling cad and clown and may very well be grateful to the fool that takes him down as for all the windy waters they were rained like trumpets down when good drink had been dishonoured by the tipplers of the town when red wine had brought red ruin and the deathdance of our times heaven sent us soda water as a torment for our crimes upon my soul this water tastes quite nice i wonder what vintage now and he smacked his lips with solemnity it tastes just like the year tasted you can fancy anything in the tasting way returned his shorter companion mr jack who was always up to his tricks did serve plain water in those little glasses they drink liqueurs out of and everyone swore it was a delicious liqueur and wanted to know where they could get it all except old admiral guffin who said it tasted too strong of olives but waters much the best for our game certainly patrick nodded and then said i doubt if i could do it if it werent for the comfort of looking at that and he kicked the rumkeg and feeling we shall have a good swig at it some day it feels like a fairytale carrying that about as if rum were a pirates treasure as if it were molten gold besides we can have such fun with it with other people what was that joke i thought of this morning oh i remember wheres that milk can of mine for the next twenty minutes he was industriously occupied with his milk can and the cask pump watching him with an interest amounting to anxiety lifting his head however at the end of that time he knotted his red brows and said whats that whats what asked the other traveller that said captain patrick dalroy and pointed to a figure approaching on the road parallel to the river i mean whats it for the figure had a longish beard and very long hair falling far below its shoulders it had a serious and steadfast expression it was dressed in what the inexperienced mr pump at first took to be its nightgown but afterward learned to be its complete goats hair tunic unmixed even with a thread of the destructive and deadly wool of the sheep it had no boots on its feet it walked very swiftly to a particular turn of the stream and then turned very sharply since it had accomplished its constitutional and walked back toward the perfect town of peaceways i suppose its somebody from that milk place said humphrey pump indulgently they seem to be pretty mad i dont mind that so much said dalroy im mad myself sometimes but a madman has only one merit and last link with god a madman is always logical now what is the logical connection between living on milk and wearing your hair long most of us lived on milk when we had no hair at all how do they connect it up are there any heads even for a synopsis is it say milk water shavingwater shaving hair is it milk kindness unkindness convicts hair what is the logical connection between having too much hair and having far too few boots what can it be is it hair hairtrunk leathertrunk leatherboots is it hair beard oysters seaside paddling no boots man is liable to err especially when every mistake he makes is called a movement but why should all the lunacies live together because all the lunatics should live together said humphrey and if youd seen what happened up at crampton with the farmingout idea youd know its all very well captain but if people can prevent a guest of great importance being buried up to the neck in farm manure they will they will really he coughed almost apologetically he was about to attempt a resumption of the conversation when he saw his companion slap the milk can and keg back into the car and get into it himself you drive he said drive me where those things live you know hump they did not however arrive in the civic centre of such things without yet another delay they left the river and followed the man with the long hair and the goatskin frock and he stopped as it happened at a house on the outskirts of the village the adventurers stopped also out of curiosity and were at first relieved to see the man almost instantly reappear having transacted his business with a quickness that seemed incredible a second glance showed them it was not the man but another man dressed exactly like him a few minutes more of inquisitive delay showed them many of the kilty and goatish sect going in and out of this particular place each clad in his innocent uniform this must be the temple and chapel muttered patrick it must be here they sacrifice a glass of milk to a cow or whatever it is they do well the joke is pretty obvious but we must wait for a lull in the crowding of the congregation when the last longhaired phantom had faded up the road dalroy sprang from the car and drove the signboard deep into the earth with savage violence and then very quietly knocked at the door the apparent owner of the place of whom the two last of the longhaired and barefooted idealists were taking a rather hurried farewell was a man curiously illfitted for the part he seemed cast for in the only possible plot both pump and dalroy thought they had never seen a man look so sullen his face was of the rubicund sort that does not suggest jollity but merely a stagnant indigestion in the head his mustache hung heavy and dark his brows yet heavier and darker dalroy had seen something of the sort on the faces of defeated people disgracefully forced into submission but he could not make head or tail of it in connection with the priggish perfections of peaceways it was all the odder because he was manifestly prosperous his clothes were smartly cut in something of the sporting manner and the inside of his house was at least four times grander than the outside but what mystified them most was this that he did not so much exhibit the natural curiosity of a gentleman whose private house is entered by strangers but rather an embarrassed and restless expectation during dalroys eager apologies and courteous inquiries about the direction and accommodations of peaceways his eye which was of the boiled gooseberry order perpetually wandered from them to the cupboard and then again to the window and at last he got up and went to look out into the road oh yes sir very healthy place peaceways he said peering through the lattice very dash it what do they mean very healthy place of course they have their little ways only drink pure milk dont they asked dalroy the householder looked at him with a rather wild eye and grunted yes so they say and he went again to the window ive bought some of it said patrick patting his pet milk can which he carried under his arm as if unable to be separated from dr meadowss discovery have a glass of milk sir the mans boiled eye began to bulge in anger or some other emotion what do you want he muttered are you tecs or what agents and distributors of the meadowss mountain milk said the captain with simple pride taste it the dazed householder took a glass of the blameless liquid and sipped it and the change on his face was extraordinary well im jiggered he said with a broad and rather coarse grin thats a queer dodge youre in the joke i see then he went again restlessly to the window and added but if were all friends why the blazes dont the others come in ive never known trade so slow before who are the others asked mr pump oh the usual peaceways people said the other they generally come here before work dr meadows dont work them for very long hours that wouldnt be healthy or whatever he calls it but hes particular about their being punctual ive seen em running with all their pureminded togs on when the hooter gave the last call then he abruptly opened the front door and called out impatiently but not loudly come along in if youre coming youll give the show away if you play the fool out there patrick looked out also and the view of the road outside was certainly rather singular he was used to crowds large and small collecting outside houses which he had honoured with the sign of the old ship but they generally stared up at it in unaffected wonder and amusement but outside this open door some twenty or thirty persons in what pump had called their nightgowns were moving to and fro like somnambulists apparently blind to the presence of the sign looking at the other side of the road looking at the horizon looking at the clouds of morning and only occasionally stopping to whisper to each other but when the owner of the house called to one of these ostentatiously abstracted beings and asked him hoarsely what the devil was the matter it was natural for the milkfed one to turn his feeble eye toward the sign the gooseberry eyes followed his and the face to which they belonged was a study in apoplectic astonishment what the hell have you done to my house he demanded of course they cant come in if this things here ill take it down if you like said dalroy stepping out and picking it up like a flower from the front garden to the amazement of the men in the road who thought they had strayed into a nursery fairytale but i wish in return youd give me some idea of what the blazes all this means wait till ive served these men replied his host the goatgarbed persons went very sheepishly or goatishly into the now signless building and were rapidly served with raw spirits which mr pump suspected to be of no very superior quality when the last goat was gone captain dalroy said i mean that all this seems to me topsyturvy i understood that as the law stands now if theres a sign they are allowed to drink and if there isnt they arent the law said the man in a voice thick with scorn do you think these poor brutes are afraid of the law as they are of the doctor why should they be afraid of the doctor asked dalroy innocently i always heard that peaceways was a selfgoverning republic selfgoverning be damned was the illiberal reply dont he own all the houses and could turn em out in a snow storm dont e pay all the wages and could starve em stiff in a month the law and he snorted a moment after he squared his elbows on the table and began to explain more fully i was a brewer about here and had the biggest brewery in these parts there were only two houses which didnt belong to me and the magistrates took away their licenses after a time ten years ago you could see hugbys ales written beside every sign in the county then came these cursed radicals and our leader lord ivywood must go over to their side about it and let this doctor buy all the land under some new law that there shant be any pubs at all and so my business is ruined so that he can sell his milk luckily id done pretty well before and had some compensation of course and i still do a fair trade on the qt as you see but of course that dont amount to half the old one for theyre afraid of old meadows finding out snuffling old blighter and the gentleman with the good clothes spat on the carpet i am a radical myself said the irishman rather coldly for all information on the conservative party i must refer you to my friend mr pump who is of course in the inmost secrets of his leaders but it seems to me very rum sort of radicalism to eat and drink at the orders of a master who is a madman merely because hes also a millionaire liberty what very complicated and even unsatisfactory social developments are committed in thy name why dont they kick the old ass round the town a bit no boots is that why theyre allowed no boots oh roll him down hill in a milk can he cant object to that i dont know said pump in his ruminant way master christians aunt did but ladies are more particular of course look here cried dalroy in some excitement if i stick up that sign outside and stay here to help will you defy them youd be strictly within the law and any private coercion i can promise you they shall repent plant the sign and sell the stuff openly like a man and you may stand in english history like a deliverer mr hugby of hugbys ales only looked gloomily at the table his was not the sort of drinking nor the sort of drinkselling on which the revolutionary sentiment flourishes well said the captain will you come with me and say hear hear and how true what matchless eloquence if i make a speech in the marketplace come along theres room in our car well ill come with you if you like replied mr hugby heavily its true if yours is allowed we might get our trade back too and putting on a silk hat he followed the captain and the innkeeper out to their little car the model village was not an appropriate background for mr hugbys silk hat indeed the hat somehow seemed to bring out by contrast all that was fantastic in the place it was a superb morning some hours after sunrise the edges of the sky touching the ring of dim woods and distant hills were still jewelled with the tiny transparent clouds of daybreak delicate red and green or yellow but above the vault of heaven rose through turquoise into a torrid and solid blue in which the other clouds the colossal cumuli tumbled about like a celestial pillowfight the bulk of the houses were as white as the clouds so that it looked to use another simile as if some of the whitewashed cottages were flying and falling about the sky but most of the white houses were picked out here and there with bright colours here an ornament in orange or there a stripe of lemon yellow as if by the brush of a baby giant the houses had no thatching thatching is not hygienic but were mostly covered with a sort of peacock green tiles bought cheap at a preraphaelite bazaar or less frequently by some still more esoteric sort of terra cotta bricks the houses were not english nor homelike nor suited to the landscape for the houses had not been built by free men for themselves but at the fancy of a whimsical lord but considered as a sort of elfin city in a pantomime it was a really picturesque background for pantomimic proceedings i fear mr dalroys proceedings from the first rather deserved that name to begin with he left the sign the cask and the keg all wrapped and concealed in the car but removed all the wraps of his own disguise and stood on the central patch of grass in that green uniform that looked all the more insolent for being as ragged as the grass even that was less ragged than his red hair which no red jungle of the east could imitate then he took out almost tenderly the large milk can and deposited it almost reverently on the island of turf then he stood beside it like napoleon beside a gun with an expression of tremendous seriousness and even severity then he drew his sword and with that flashing weapon as with a flail lashed and thrashed the echoing metal can till the din was deafening and mr hugby hastily got out of the car and withdrew to a slight distance stopping his ears mr pump sat solidly at the steering wheel well knowing it might be necessary to start in some haste gather gather gather peaceways shouted patrick still banging on the can and lamenting the difficulties of adapting macgregors gathering to the name and occasion were landless landless landless peaceways two or three of the goatclad recognising mr hugby with a guilty look drew near with great caution and the captain shouted at them as if they were an army covering salisbury plain citizens he roared saying anything that came into his head try the only original unadulterated mountain milk for which alone mahomet came to the mountain the original milk of the land flowing with milk and honey the high quality of which could alone have popularised so unappetising a combination try our milk none others are genuine who can do without milk even whales cant do without milk if any lady or gentleman keeps a favourite whale at home nows their chance the early whale catches the milk just look at our milk if you say you cant look at the milk because its in the can well look at the can you must look at the can you simply must when duty whispers low thou must he bellowed at the top of his voice in a highly impromptu peroration when duty whispers low thou must the youth replies i can and with the word can he hit the can with a shocking and shattering noise like a peal of demoniac bells of steel this introductory speech is open to criticism from those who regard it as intended for the study rather than the stage the present chronicler who has no aim save truth is bound to record that for its own unscrupulous purpose it was extremely successful a great mass of the citizens of peaceways having been attracted by the noise of one man shouting like a crowd there are crowds who do not care to revolt but there are no crowds who do not like someone else to do it for them a fact which the safest oligarchs may be wise to learn but dalroys ultimate triumph i regret to say consisted in actually handing to a few of the foremost of his audience some samples of his blameless beverage the fact was certainly striking some were paralysed with surprise some were abruptly broken double with laughter many chuckled some cheered all looked radiantly toward the eccentric orator and yet the radiance died quietly and suddenly from their faces and only because one little old man had joined the group a little old man in white linen with a white pointed beard and a white powderpuff of hair like thistledown a man whom almost every man present could have killed with the left arm chapter xix the hospitality of the captain dr moses meadows whether that was his name or an anglicised version of it had certainly come in the first instance from a little town in germany and his first two books were written in german his first two books were his best for he began with a genuine enthusiasm for physical science and this was adulterated with nothing worse than a hatred of what he thought was superstition and what many of us think is the soul of the state the first enthusiasm was most notable in the first book which was concerned to show that in the female not upsprouting of the whiskers was from the therewith increasing arrested mentality derived in his second book he came more to grips with delusions and for some time he was held to have proved to everyone who agreed with him already that the time ghost had been walking particularly rapidly lately and that the christus mythus was by the alcoholic minds trouble explained then unfortunately he came across the institution called death and began to argue with it not seeing any rational explanation of this custom of dying so prevalent among his fellowcitizens he concluded that it was merely traditional which he thought meant effete and began to think of nothing but ways of evading or delaying it this had a rather narrowing effect on him and he lost much of that acrid ardour which had humanised the atheism of his youth when he would almost have committed suicide for the pleasure of taunting god with not being there his later idealism grew more and more into materialism and consisted of his changing hypotheses and discoveries about the healthiest foods there is no need to detain the reader over what has been called his oil period his seaweed period has been authoritatively expounded in professor nyms valuable little work and on the events of his glue period it is perhaps not very generous to dwell it was during his prolonged stay in england that he chanced on the instance of the longevity of milk consumers and built on it a theory which was at the beginning at least sincere unfortunately it was also successful wealth flowed in to the inventor and proprietor of mountain milk and he began to feel a fourth and last enthusiasm which also can come late in life and have a narrowing effect on the mind in the altercation which naturally followed on his discovery of the antics of mr patrick dalroy he was very dignified but naturally not very tolerant for he was quite unused to anything happening in spite of him or anything important even happening without him in the land that lay around at first he hinted severely that the captain had stolen the milk can from the milkproducing premises and sent several workmen to count the cans in each shed but dalroy soon put him right about that i bought it in a shop at wyddington he said and since then i have used no other youll hardly believe me he said with some truth but when i went into that shop i was quite a little man i had one glass of your mountain milk and look at me now you have no right to sell the milk here said dr meadows with the faintest trace of a german accent you are not in my employment i am not responsible for your methods you are not a representative of the business im an advertisement said the captain we advertise you all over england you see that lean skimpy little man over there pointing to the indignant mr pump hes before taking meadowss mountain milk im after added mr dalroy with satisfaction you shall laugh at the magistrate said the other with a thickening accent i shall agreed patrick well ill make a clean breast of it sir the truth is it isnt your milk at all it has quite a different taste these gentlemen will tell you so a smothered giggle sent all the blood to the eminent capitalists face then either you have stolen my can and are a thief he said stamping or you have introduced inferior substances into my discovery and are an adulterer er try adulteratist said dalroy kindly prince albert always said adulteratarian dear old albert it seems like yesterday but it is of course today and its as true as daylight that this stuff tastes different i cant tell you what the taste is subdued guffaws from the outskirts of the crowd its something between the taste of your first sugarstick and the fagend of your fathers cigar its as innocent as heaven and as hot as hell it tastes like a paradox it tastes like a prehistoric inconsistency i trust i make myself clear the men who taste it most are the simplest men that god has made and it always reminds them of the salt because it is made out of sugar have some and with a gesture of staggering hospitality he shot out his long arm with the little glass at the end of it the despotic curiosity in the prussian overcame even his despotic dignity he took a sip of the liquid and his eyes stood out from his face youve been mixing something with the milk were the first words that came to him yes answered dalroy and so have you unless youre a swindler why is your milk advertised as different from everyone elses milk if you havent made the difference why does a glass of your milk cost threepence and a glass of ordinary milk a penny if you havent put twopennorth of something into it now look here dr meadows the public analyst who would judge this happens to be an honest man i have a list of the twentyone and a half honest men still employed in such posts i make you a fair offer he shall decide what it is i add to the milk if you let him decide what it is you add to the milk you must add something to the milk or what can all these wheels and pumps and pulleys be for will you tell me here and now what you add to the milk which makes it so exceedingly mountain there was a long silence full of the same sense of submerged mirth in the mob but the philanthropist had fallen into a naked frenzy in the sunlight and shaking his fists aloft in a way unknown to all the english around him he cried out ach but i know what you add i know what you add it is the alcohol and you have no sign and you shall laugh at a magistrate dalroy with a bow retired to the car removed a number of wrappings and produced the prodigious wooden signpost of the old ship with its blue threedecker and red st georges cross conspicuously displayed this he planted on his narrow territory of turf and looked round serenely in this old oakpanelled inn of mine he said i will laugh at a million magistrates not that theres anything unhygienic about this inn no low ceilings or stuffiness here windows open everywhere except in the floor and as i hear some are saying there ought always to be food sold with fermented liquor why my dear dr meadows ive got a cheese here that will make another man of you at least well hope so we can but try but dr meadows was long past being merely angry the exhibition of the sign had put him into a serious difficulty like most sceptics like even the most genuine sceptics such as bradlaugh he was as legal as he was sceptical he had a profound fear which also had in it something better than fear of being ultimately found in the wrong in a police court or a public inquiry and he also suffered the tragedy of all such men living in modern england that he must always be certain to respect the law while never being certain of what it was he could only remember generally that lord ivywood when introducing or defending the great ivywood act on this matter had dwelt very strongly on the unique and significant nature of the sign and he could not be certain that if he disregarded it altogether he might not eventually be cast in heavy damages or even go to prison in spite of his success in business of course he knew quite well that he had a thousand answers to such nonsense that a patch of grass in the road couldnt be an inn that the sign wasnt even produced when the captain began to hand round the rum but he also knew quite well that in the black peril we call british law that is not the point he had heard points quite as obvious urged to a judge and urged in vain at the bottom of his mind he found this fact rich as he was lord ivywood had made him and on which side would lord ivywood be captain said humphrey pump speaking for the first time wed better be getting away i feel it in my bones inhospitable innkeeper cried the captain indignantly and after i have gone out of the way to license your premises why this is the dawn of peace in the great city of peaceways i dont despair of dr meadows tossing off another bumper before weve done for the moment brother hugby will engage as he spoke he served out milk and rum at random and still the doctor had too much terror of our legal technicalities to make a final interference but when mr hugby of hugbys ales heard his name called he first of all jumped so as almost to dislodge the silk hat then he stood quite still then he accepted a glass of the new mountain milk and then his very face became full of speech before he had spoken a word theres a motor coming along the road from the far hills said humphrey quietly itll be across the last bridge down stream in ten minutes and come up on this side well said the captain impatiently i suppose youve seen a motor before not in this valley all this morning answered pump mr chairman said mr hugby feeling a dim disposition to say mr vice in memory of old commercial banquets im sure were all lawabiding people here and wish to remain friends especially with our good friend the doctor may he never want a friend or a bottle that is in short anything he wants as we go up the hill of prosperity and so on but as our friend here with the signboard seems to be within his rights well i think the times come when we can look at these things more broadly so to speak now i know its quite true those dirty little pubs do a lot of harm to a property and you get a lot of ignorant people there who are just like pigs and i dont say our friend the doctor hasnt done good by clearing em away but a big wellmanaged business with plenty of capital behind it is quite another thing well friends you all know that i was originally in the trade though i have of course left off selling under the new regulations here the goats looked rather guiltily at their cloven hoofs but ive got my little bit and i wouldnt mind putting it into this old ship here if our friend would allow it to be run on business lines and especially if hed enlarge the premises a bit ha ha and if our good friend the doctor you rascal fellow spluttered meadows your goot friend the doctor will make you dance before a magistrate now dont be unbusinesslike reasoned the brewer it wont hurt your sales its quite a different public dont you see do talk like a business man i am not a business man said the scientist with fiery eyes i am a servant of humanity then said dalroy why do you never do what your master tells you the motor has crossed the river said humphrey pump you would undo all my works cried the doctor with sincere passion when i have built this town myself when i have made it sober and healthful myself when i am awake and about before anyone in the town myself watching over its interests you would ruin all to sell your barbaric and fundamentally beastly beer and then you call me a goot friend i am not a goot friend that i cant say growled hugby but if it comes to that arent you trying to sell a motor car drove up with a white explosion of dust and about six very dusty people got out of it even through the densest disguise of the swift motorist pump perceived in many of them the peculiar style and bodily carriage of the police the most evident exception was a long and more slender figure which on removing its cap and goggles disclosed the dark and drooping features of j leveson secretary he walked across to the little old millionaire who instantly recognized him and shook hands they confabulated for some little time turning over some official documents dr meadows cleared his throat and said to the whole crowd i am very glad to be able to announce to you all that this extraordinary outrage has been too late attempted lord ivywood with the promptitude he so invariably shows has immediately communicated to places of importance such as this a most just and right alteration of the law which exactly meets the present case we shall sleep in jail tonight said humphrey pump i know it in my bones it is enough to say proceeded the millionaire that by the law as it now stands any innkeeper even if he display a sign is subject to imprisonment if he sells alcohol on premises where it has not been previously kept for three days i thought it would be something like that muttered pump shall we give up captain or shall we try a bolt for it even the impudence of dalroy appeared for the instant dazed and stilled he was staring forlornly up into the abyss of sky above him as if like shelley he could get inspiration from the last and purest clouds and the perfect hues of the ends of heaven at last he said in a soft and meditative voice the single syllable sells pump looked at him sharply with a remarkable expression growing on his grim face but the doctor was far too rabidly rejoicing in his triumph to understand the captains meaning sells alcohol are the exact words he insisted brandishing the blue oblong of the new act of parliament so far as i am concerned they are inexact words said captain dalroy with polite indifference i have not been selling alcohol i have been giving it away has anybody here paid me money has anybody here seen anybody else pay me money im a philanthropist just like dr meadows im his living image mr leveson and dr meadows looked across at each other and on the face of the first was consternation and on the second a full return of all his terrors of the complicated law i shall remain here for several weeks continued the captain leaning elegantly on the can and shall give away gratis such supplies of this excellent drink as may be demanded by the citizens it appears that there is no such supply at present in this district and i feel sure that no person present can object to so strictly legal and highly charitable an arrangement in this he was apparently in error for several persons present seemed to object to it but curiously enough it was not the withered and fanatical face of the philanthropist meadows nor the dark and equine face of the official leveson which stood out most vividly as a picture of protest the face most strangely unsympathetic with this form of charity was that of the exproprietor of hugbys ales his gooseberry eyes were almost dropping from his head and his words sprang from his lips before he could stop them and you blooming well think you can come here like a big buffoon you beast and take away all my trade old meadows turned on him with the swiftness of an adder and what is your trade mr hugby he asked the brewer bubbled with a sort of bursting anger the goats all looked at the ground as is according to a roman poet the habit of the lower animals man in the character of mr patrick dalroy taking advantage of a free but fine translation of the latin passage looked aloft and with uplifted eyes beheld his own hereditary skies well all i can say is roared mr hugby if the police come all this way and cant lock up a dirty loafer whose coats all in rags theres an end of me paying these fat infernal taxes and yes said dalroy in a voice that fell like an axe there is an end of you please god its brewers like you that have made the inns stink with poison till even good men asked for no inns at all and you are worse than the teetotallers for you prevented what they never knew and as for you eminent man of science great philanthropist idealist and destroyer of inns let me give one cold fact for your information you are not respected you are obeyed why should i or anyone respect you particularly you say you built this town and get up at daybreak to watch this town you built it for money and you watch it for more money why should i respect you because you are fastidious about food that your poor old digestion may outlive the hearts of better men why should you be the god of this valley whose god is your belly merely because you do not even love your god but only fear him go home to your prayers old man for all men shall die read the bible if you like as they do in your german home and i suppose you once read it to pick texts as you now read it to pick holes i dont read it myself im afraid but i remember some words in old mulligans translation and i leave them with you unless god and he made a movement with his arm so natural and yet so vast that for an instant the town really looked like a toy of bright coloured cardboard at the feet of the giant unless god build the city their labour is but lost that build it unless god keep the city the watchman watcheth in vain it is lost labour that you rise up early in the morning and eat the bread of carefulness while he giveth his beloved sleep try and understand what that means and never mind whether its elohistic and now hump well away and away im tired of the green tiles over there come fill up my cup and he banged down the cask in the car come saddle my horses and call out my men and tremble gay goats in the midst of your glee for youve no seen the last of my milk can and me this song was joyously borne away with mr dalroy in the disappearing car and the motorists were miles beyond pursuit from peaceways before they thought of halting again but they were still beside the bank of that noble and enlarging river and in a place of deep fern and fairyribboned birches with the glowing and gleaming water behind them patrick asked his friend to stop the car by the way said humphrey suddenly there was one thing i didnt understand why was he so afraid of the public analyst what poison and chemicals does he put in the milk h answered the captain i take it without milk myself and he bent over as if to drink of the stream as he had done at daybreak chapter xx the turk and the futurists mr adrian crooke was a successful chemist whose shop was in the neighbourhood of victoria but his face expressed more than is generally required in a successful chemist it was a curious face prematurely old and like parchment but acute and decisive with real headwork in every line of it nor was his conversation when he did converse out of keeping with this he had lived in many countries and had a rich store of anecdote about the more quaint and sometimes the more sinister side of his work visions of the vapour of eastern drugs or guesses at the ingredients of renascence poisons he himself it need hardly be said was a most respectable and reliable apothecary or he would not have had the custom of families especially among the upper classes but he enjoyed as a hobby the study of the dark days and lands where his science had lain sometimes on the borders of magic and sometimes upon the borders of murder hence it often happened that persons who in their serious senses were well aware of his harmless and useful habits would leave his shop on some murky and foggy night with their heads so full of wild tales of the eating of hemp or the poisoning of roses they could hardly help fancying that the shop with its glowing moon of crimson or saffron like bowls of blood and sulphur was really a house of the black art it was doubtless for such conversational pleasures in part that hibbs however entered the shop as well as for a small glass of the same restorative medicine which he had been taking when leveson found him by the open window but this did not prevent hibbs from expressing considerable surprise and some embarrassment when leveson entered the same chemists and asked for the same chemical indeed leveson looked harassed and weary enough to want it youve been out of town havent you said leveson no luck they got away again on some quibble the police wouldnt make the arrest and even old meadows thought it might be illegal im sick of it where are you going i thought said mr hibbs of dropping in at this postfuturist exhibition i believe lord ivywood will be there he is showing it to the prophet i dont pretend to know much about art but i hear its very fine there was a long silence and mr leveson said people always prejudiced against new ideas then there was another long silence and mr hibbs said after all they said the same of whistler refreshed by this ritual mr leveson became conscious of the existence of crooke and said to him cheerfully thats so in your department too isnt it i suppose the greatest pioneers in chemistry were unpopular in their own time look at the borgias said mr crooke they got themselves quite disliked youre very flippant you know said leveson in a fatigued way well so long are you coming hibbs and the two gentlemen who were both attired in high hats and afternoon callers coats betook themselves down the street it was a fine sunny day the twin of the day before that had shone so brightly on the white town of peaceways and their walk was a pleasant one along a handsome street with high houses and small trees that overlooked the river all the way for the pictures were exhibited in a small but famous gallery a rather rococo building of which the entrance steps almost descended upon the thames the building was girt on both sides and behind with gaudy flowerbeds and on the top of the steps in front of the byzantine doorway stood their old friend misysra ammon smiling broadly and in an unusually sumptuous costume but even the sight of that fragrant eastern flower did not seem to revive altogether the spirits of the drooping secretary you have coome said the beaming prophet to see the decoration it is approoooved i haf approoooved it we came to see the postfuturist pictures began hibbs but leveson was silent there are no pictures said the turk simply if there had been i could not haf approoooved for those of our religion pictures are not gooood they are idols my friendss looook in there and he turned and darted a solemn forefinger just under his nose toward the gates of the gallery looook in there and you will find no idols no idols at all i have most carefully looooked into every one of the frames every one i have approoooved no trace of ze man form no trace of ze animal form all decoration as gooood as the goooodest of carpets it harms not lord ivywood smile of happiness for i tell him islam indeed progresses ze old moslems allow to draw the picture of the vegetable here i hunt even for the vegetable and there is no vegetable hibbs whose trade was tact naturally did not think it wise that the eminent misysra should go on lecturing from a tall flight of steps to the whole street and river so he had slipped past with a general proposal to go in and see the prophet and the secretary followed and all entered the outer hall where lord ivywood stood with the white face of a statue he was the only statue the new moslems were allowed to worship on a sofa like a purple island in the middle of the sea of floor sat enid wimpole talking eagerly to her cousin dorian doing in fact her best to prevent the family quarrel which threatened to follow hard on the incident at westminster in the deeper perspective of the rooms lady joan brett was floating about and if her attitude before the postfuturist pictures could not be called humble or even inquiring it is but just to that school to say that she seemed to be quite as bored with the floor that she walked on and the parasol she held bit by bit other figures or groups of that world drifted through the exhibition of the postfuturists it is a very small world but it is just big enough and just small enough to govern a country that is a country with no religion and it has all the vanity of a mob and all the reticence of a secret society leveson instantly went up to lord ivywood pulled papers from his pocket and was plainly telling him of the escape from peaceways ivywoods face hardly changed he was or felt above some things and one of them was blaming a servant before the servants social superiors but no one could say he looked less like cold marble than before i made all possible inquiries about their subsequent route the secretary was heard saying and the most serious feature is that they seem to have taken the road for london quite so replied the statue they will be easier to capture here lady enid by a series of assurances most of which were i regret to say lies had succeeded in preventing the scandal of her cousin dorian actually cutting her cousin philip but she knew very little of the masculine temper if she really thought she had prevented the profound intellectual revolt of the poet against the politician ever since he heard mr hibbs say yars yars and order his arrest by a common policeman the feelings of dorian wimpole had flowed for some four days and nights in a direction highly contrary to the ideals of mr hibbs and the sudden appearance of that blameless diplomatist quickened the mental current to a cataract but as he could not insult hibbs whom socially he did not even know and could not insult ivywood with whom he had just had a formal reconciliation it was absolutely necessary that he should insult something else instead all watchers for the dawn will be deeply distressed to know that the postfuturist school of painting received the full effects of this perverted wrath in vain did mr leveson affirm from time to time people always prejudiced against new ideas vainly did mr hibbs say at the proper intervals after all they said the same of whistler not by such decent formalities was the frenzy of dorian to be appeased that little turk has more sense than you have he said he passes it as a good wallpaper i should say it was a bad wallpaper the sort of wallpaper that gives a sick man fever when he hasnt got it but to call it pictures you might as well call it seats for the lord mayors show a seat isnt a seat if you cant see the lord mayors show a picture isnt a picture if you cant see any picture you can sit down at home more comfortably than you can at a procession and you can walk about at home more comfortably than you can at a picture gallery theres only one thing to be said for a street show or a picture show and that is whether there is anything to be shown now then show me something well said lord ivywood good humouredly motioning toward the wall in front of him let me show you the portrait of an old lady well said dorian stolidly which is it mr hibbs made a hasty gesture of identification but was so unfortunate as to point to the picture of rain in the apennines instead of the portrait of an old lady and his intervention increased the irritation of dorian wimpole most probably as mr hibbs afterward explained it was because a vivacious movement of the elbow of mr wimpole interfered with the exact pointing of the forefinger of mr hibbs in any case mr hibbs was sharply and horridly fixed by embarrassment so that he had to go away to the refreshment bar and eat three lobsterpatties and even drink a glass of that champagne that had once been his ruin but on this occasion he stopped at one glass and returned with a full diplomatic responsibility he returned to find that dorian wimpole had forgotten all the facts of time place and personal pride in an argument with lord ivywood exactly as he had forgotten such facts in an argument with patrick dalroy in a dark wood with a donkeycart and philip ivywood was interested also his cold eyes even shone for though his pleasure was almost purely intellectual it was utterly sincere and i do trust the untried i do follow the inexperienced he was saying quietly with his fine inflections of voice you say this is changing the very nature of art i want to change the very nature of art everything lives by turning into something else exaggeration is growth but exaggeration of what demanded dorian i cannot see a trace of exaggeration in these pictures because i cannot find a hint of what it is they want to exaggerate you cant exaggerate the feathers of a cow or the legs of a whale you can draw a cow with feathers or a whale with legs for a joke though i hardly think such jokes are in your line but dont you see my good philip that even then the joke depends on its looking like a cow and not only like a thing with feathers even then the joke depends on the whale as well as the legs you can combine up to a certain point you can distort up to a certain point after that you lose the identity and with that you lose everything a centaur is so much of a man with so much of a horse the centaur must not be hastily identified with the horsy man and the mermaid must be maidenly even if there is something fishy about her social conduct no said lord ivywood in the same quiet way i understand what you mean and i dont agree i should like the centaur to turn into something else that is neither man nor horse but not something that has nothing of either asked the poet yes answered ivywood with the same queer quiet gleam in his colourless eyes something that has nothing of either but whats the good argued dorian a thing that has changed entirely has not changed at all it has no bridge of crisis it can remember no change if you wake up tomorrow and you simply are mrs dope an old woman who lets lodgings at broadstairs well i dont doubt mrs dope is a saner and happier person than you are but in what way have you progressed what part of you is better dont you see this prime fact of identity is the limit set on all living things no said philip with suppressed but sudden violence i deny that any limit is set upon living things why then i understand said dorian why though you make such good speeches you have never written any poetry lady joan who was looking with tedium at a rich pattern of purple and green in which misysra attempted to interest her imploring her to disregard the mere title which idolatrously stated it as first communion in the snow abruptly turned her full face to dorian it was a face to which few men could feel indifferent especially when thus suddenly shown them why cant he write poetry she asked do you mean he would resent the limits of metre and rhyme and so on the poet reflected for a moment and then said well partly but i mean more than that too as one can be candid in the family i may say that what everyone says about him is that he has no humour but thats not my complaint at all i think my complaint is that he has no pathos that is he does not feel human limitations that is he will not write poetry lord ivywood was looking with his cold unconscious profile into a little black and yellow picture called enthusiasm but joan brett leaned across to him with swarthy eagerness and cried quite provocatively dorian says youve no pathos have you any pathos he says its a sense of human limitations ivywood did not remove his gaze from the picture of enthusiasm but simply said no i have no sense of human limitations then he put up his elderly eyeglass to examine the picture better then he dropped it again and confronted joan with a face paler than usual joan he said i would walk where no man has walked and find something beyond tears and laughter my road shall be my road indeed for i will make it like the romans and my adventures shall not be in the hedges and the gutters but in the borders of the ever advancing brain i will think what was unthinkable until i thought it i will love what never lived until i loved it i will be as lonely as the first man they say she said after a silence that the first man fell you mean the priests he answered yes but even they admit that he discovered good and evil so are these artists trying to discover some distinction that is still dark to us oh said joan looking at him with a real and unusual interest then you dont see anything in the pictures yourself i see the breaking of the barriers he answered beyond that i see nothing she looked at the floor for a little time and traced patterns with her parasol like one who has really received food for thought then she said suddenly but perhaps the breaking of barriers might be the breaking of everything the clear and colourless eyes looked at her quite steadily perhaps said lord ivywood dorian wimpole made a sudden movement a few yards off where he was looking at a picture and said hullo whats this mr hibbs was literally gaping in the direction of the entrance framed in that fine byzantine archway stood a great big bony man in threadbare but careful clothes with a harsh highfeatured intelligent face to which a dark beard under the chin gave something of the puritanic cast somehow his whole personality seemed to be pulled together and explained when he spoke with a north country accent weel lards he said genially thoose be main great on tpictures but i coom for suthin in a moog haw haw leveson and hibbs looked at each other then leveson rushed from the room lord ivywood did not move a finger but mr wimpole with a sort of poetic curiosity drew nearer to the stranger and studied him its perfectly awful cried enid wimpole in a loud whisper the man must be drunk na lass said the man with gallantry ave not been droonk nobbut at hurley fair these years and all am a decent lad and workin ma way back twharfdale no harm in a moog of ale lass are you quite sure asked dorian wimpole with a singular sort of delicate curiosity are you quite sure youre not drunk am not droonk said the man jovially even if these were licensed premises began dorian in the same diplomatic manner theres tsign on thoose said the stranger the black bewildered look on the face of joan brett suddenly altered she took four steps toward the doorway and then went back and sat on the purple ottoman but dorian seemed fascinated with his inquiry into the alleged decency of the lad who was working his way to wharfdale even if these were licensed premises he repeated drink could be refused you if you were drunk now are you really sure youre not drunk would you know if it was raining say aye said the man with conviction would you know any common object of your countryside inquired dorian scientifically a woman let us say an old woman aye said the man with good humour what on earth are you doing with the creature whispered enid feverishly i am trying answered the poet to prevent a very sensible man from smashing a very silly shop i beg your pardon sir as i was saying would you know these things in a picture now do you know what a landscape is and what a portrait is forgive my asking you see we are responsible while we keep the place going there soared up into the sky like a cloud of rooks the eager vanity of the north we collier lads are none so badly educated lad he said in the town a was born in there was a gallery of pictures as fine as lunnon aye and a knew em too thank you said wimpole pointing suddenly at the wall would you be so kind for instance as to look at those two pictures one represents an old woman and the other rain in the hills its a mere formality you shall have your drink when youve said which is which the northerner bowed his huge body before the two frames and peered into them patiently the long stillness that followed seemed to be something of a strain on joan who rose in a restless manner first went to look out of a window and then went out of the front door at length the artcritic lifted a large puzzled but still philosophical face soomehow or other he said a mun be droonk after all you have testified cried dorian with animation you have all but saved civilization and by god you shall have your drink and he brought from the refreshment table a huge bumper of the hibbsian champagne and declined payment by the rapid method of running out of the gallery on to the steps outside joan was already standing there out the little side window she had seen the incredible thing she expected to see which explained the ludicrous scene inside she saw the red and blue wooden flag of mr pump standing up in the flowerbeds in the sun as serenely as if it were a tall and tropical flower and yet in the brief interval between the window and the door it had vanished as if to remind her it was a flying dream but two men were in a little motor outside which was in the very act of starting they were in motoring disguise but she knew who they were all that was deep in her all that was sceptical all that was stoical all that was noble made her stand as still as one of the pillars of the porch but a dog bearing the name of quoodle sprang up in the moving car and barked with joy at the mere sight of her and though she had borne all else something in that bestial innocence of an animal suddenly blinded her with tears it could not however blind her to the extraordinary fact that followed mr dorian wimpole attired in anything but motoring costume dressed in that compromise between fashion and art which seems proper to the visiting of picturegalleries did not by any means stand as still as one of the pillars of the porch he rushed down the steps ran after the car and actually sprang into it without disarranging his whistlerian silk hat good afternoon he said to dalroy pleasantly you owe me a motorride you know chapter xxi the road to roundabout patrick dalroy looked at the invader with a heavy and yet humorous expression and merely said i didnt steal your car really i didnt oh no answered dorian ive heard all about it since and as youre rather the persecuted party so to speak it wouldnt be fair not to tell you that i dont agree much with ivywood about all this i disagree with him or rather to speak medically he disagrees with me he has ever since i woke up after an oyster supper and found myself in the house of commons with policemen calling out who goes home indeed inquired dalroy drawing his red bushy eyebrows together do the officials in parliament say who goes home yes answered wimpole indifferently its a part of some old custom in the days when members of parliament might be attacked in the street well inquired patrick in a rational tone why arent they attacked in the street there was a silence it is a holy mystery said the captain at last but who goes home that is uncommonly good the captain had received the poet into the car with all possible expressions of affability and satisfaction but the poet who was keensighted enough about people of his own sort could not help thinking that the captain was a little absentminded as they flew thundering through the mazes of south london for pump had crossed westminster bridge and was making for the surrey hills the big blue eyes of the big redhaired man rolled perpetually up and down the streets and after longer and longer silences he found expression for his thoughts doesnt it strike you that there are a very large number of chemists in london nowadays are there asked wimpole carelessly well there certainly are two very close to each other just over there yes and both the same name replied dalroy crooke and i saw the same mr crooke chemicalizing round the corner he seems to be a highly omnipresent deity a large business i suppose observed dorian wimpole too large for its profits i should say said dalroy what can people want with two chemists of the same sort within a few yards of each other do they put one leg into one shop and one into the other and have their corns done in both at once or do they take an acid in one shop and an alkali in the next and wait for the fizz or do they take the poison in the first shop and the emetic in the second shop it seems like carrying delicacy too far it almost amounts to living a double life but perhaps said dorian he is an uproariously popular chemist this mr crooke perhaps theres a rush on some specialty of his it seems to me said the captain that there are certain limitations to such popularity in the case of a chemist if a man sells very good tobacco people may smoke more and more of it from sheer selfindulgence but i never heard of anybody exceeding in codliver oil even castoroil i should say is regarded with respect rather than true affection after a few minutes of silence he said is it safe to stop here for an instant pump i think so replied humphrey if youll promise me not to have any adventures in the shop the motor car stopped before yet a fourth arsenal of mr crooke and his pharmacy and dalroy went in before pump and his companion could exchange a word the captain came out again with a curious expression on his countenance especially round the mouth mr wimpole said dalroy will you give us the pleasure of dining with us this evening many would consider it an unceremonious invitation to an unconventional meal and it may be necessary to eat it under a hedge or even up a tree but you are a man of taste and one does not apologise for humps rum or humps cheese to persons of taste we will eat and drink of our best tonight it is a banquet i am not very certain whether you and i are friends or enemies but at least there shall be peace tonight friends i hope said the poet smiling but why peace especially tonight because there will be war tomorrow answered patrick dalroy whichever side of it you may be on i have just made a singular discovery and he relapsed into his silence as they flew out of the fringe of london into the woods and hills beyond croydon dalroy remained in the same mood of brooding dorian was brushed by the butterfly wing of that fleeting slumber that will come on a man hurried through the air after long lounging in hot drawing rooms even the dog quoodle was asleep at the bottom of the car as for humphrey pump he very seldom talked when he had anything else to do thus it happened that long landscapes and perspectives were shot past them like suddenly shifted slides and long stretches of time elapsed before any of them spoke again the sky was changing from the pale golds and greens of evening to the burning blue of a strong summer night a night of strong stars the walls of woodland that flew past them like long assegais were mostly at first of the fenced and parklike sort endless oblong blocks of black pinewood shut in by boxes of thin grey wood but soon fences began to sink and pinewoods to straggle and roads to split and even to sprawl half an hour later dalroy had begun to realise something romantic and even faintly reminiscent in the roll of the country and humphrey pump had long known he was on the marches of his native land so far as the difference could be defined by a detail it seemed to consist not so much in the road rising as in the road perpetually winding it was more like a path and even where it was abrupt or aimless it seemed the more alive they appeared to be ascending a big dim hill that was built of a crowd of little hills with rounded tops it was like a cluster of domes among these domes the road climbed and curled in multitudinous curves and angles it was almost impossible to believe that it could turn itself and round on itself so often without tying itself in a knot and choking i say said dalroy breaking the silence suddenly this car will get giddy and fall down perhaps said dorian beaming at him my car as you may have noticed was much steadier patrick laughed but not without a shade of confusion i hope you got back your car all right he said this is really nothing for speed but its an uncommonly good little climber and it seems to have some climbing to do just now and even more wandering the roads certainly seem to be very irregular said dorian reflectively well cried patrick with a queer kind of impatience youre english and im not you ought to know why the road winds about like this why the saints deliver us he cried its one of the wrongs of ireland that she cant understand england england wont understand herself england wont tell us why these roads go wriggling about englishmen wont tell us you wont tell us dont be too sure said dorian with a quiet irony dalroy with an irony far from quiet emitted a loud yell of victory right he shouted more songs of the car club were all poets here i hope each shall write something about why the road jerks about so much so much as this for example he added as the whole vehicle nearly rolled over in a ditch for indeed pump appeared to be attacking such inclines as are more suitable for a goat than a small motor car this may have been exaggerated in the emotions of his companions who had both for different reasons seen much of mere flat country lately the sensation was like a combination of trying to get into the middle of the maze at hampton court and climbing the spiral staircase to the belfry at bruges this is the right way to roundabout said dalroy cheerfully charming place salubrious spot you cant miss it first to the left and right and straight on round the corner and back again thatll do for my poem get on you slackers why arent you writing your poems ill try one if you like said dorian treating his flattered egotism lightly but its too dark to write and getting darker indeed they had come under a shadow between them and the stars like the brim of a giants hat only through the holes and rents in which the summer stars could now look down on them the hill like a cluster of domes though smooth and even bare in its lower contours was topped with a tangle of spanning trees that sat above them like a bird brooding over its nest the wood was larger and vaguer than the clump that is the crown of the hill at chanctonbury but was rather like it and held much the same high and romantic position the next moment they were in the wood itself and winding in and out among the trees by a ribbon of paths the emerald twilight between the stems combined with the dragonlike contortions of the great grey roots of the beeches had a suggestion of monsters and the deep sea especially as a long litter of crimson and coppercoloured fungi which might well have been the more gorgeous types of anemone or jellyfish reddened the ground like a sunset dropped from the sky and yet contradictorily enough they had also a strong sense of being high up and even near to heaven and the brilliant summer stars that stared through the chinks of the leafy roof might almost have been white starry blossoms on the trees of the wood but though they had entered the wood as if it were a house their strongest sensation still was the rotatory it seemed as if that high green house went round and round like a revolving lighthouse or the whizgig temple in the old pantomimes the stars seemed to circle over their heads and dorian felt almost certain he had seen the same beechtree twice at length they came to a central place where the hill rose in a sort of cone in the thick of its trees lifting its trees with it here pump stopped the car and clambering up the slope came to the crawling colossal roots of a very large but very low beechtree it spread out to the four quarters of heaven more in the manner of an octopus than a tree and within its low crown of branches there was a kind of hollow like a cup into which mr humphrey pump of the old ship pebblewick suddenly and entirely disappeared when he appeared it was with a kind of rope ladder which he politely hung over the side for his companions to ascend by but the captain preferred to swing himself onto one of the octopine branches with a whirl of large wild legs worthy of a chimpanzee when they were established there each propped in the hollow against a branch almost as comfortably as in an arm chair humphrey himself descended once more and began to take out their simple stores the dog was still asleep in the car an old haunt of yours hump i suppose said the captain you seem quite at home i am at home answered pump with gravity at the sign of the old ship and he stuck the old blue and red signboard erect among the toadstools as if inviting the passerby to climb the trees for a drink the tree just topped the mound or clump of trees and from it they could see the whole champaign of the country they had passed with the silver roads roaming about in it like rivers they were so exalted they could almost fancy the stars would burn them those roads remind me of the songs youve all promised said dalroy at last lets have some supper hump and then recite humphrey had hung one of the motor lanterns onto a branch above him and proceeded by the light of it to tap the keg of rum and hand round the cheese what an extraordinary thing exclaimed dorian wimpole suddenly why im quite comfortable such a thing has never happened before i should imagine and how holy this cheese tastes it has gone on a pilgrimage answered dalroy or rather a crusade its a heroic a fighting cheese cheese of all cheeses cheeses of all the world as my compatriot mr yeats says to the somethingorother of battle its almost impossible that this cheese can have come out of such a coward as a cow i suppose he added wistfully i suppose it wouldnt do to explain that in this case hump had milked the bull that would be classed by scientists among irish legends those that have the celtic glamour and all that no i think this cheese must have come from that dun cow of dunsmore heath who had horns bigger than elephants tusks and who was so ferocious that one of the greatest of the old heroes of chivalry was required to do battle with it the rums good too ive earned this glass of rum earned it by christian humility for nearly a month ive lowered myself to the beasts of the field and gone about on all fours like a teetotaller hump circulate the bottle i mean the cask and let us have some of this poetry youre so keen about each poem must have the same title you know its a rattling good title its called an inquiry into the causes geological historical agricultural psychological psychical moral spiritual and theological of the alleged cases of double treble quadruple and other curvature in the english road conducted by a specially appointed secret commission in a hole in a tree by admittedly judicious and academic authorities specially appointed by themselves to report to the dog quoodle having power to add to their number and also to take away the number they first thought of god save the king having delivered this formula with blinding rapidity he added rather breathlessly thats the note to strike the lyric note for all his rather formless hilarity dalroy still impressed the poet as being more distrait than the others as if his mind were labouring with some bigger thing in the background he was in a sort of creative trance and humphrey pump who knew him like his own soul knew well that it was not mere literary creation rather it was a kind of creation which many modern moralists would call destruction for patrick dalroy was not a little to his misfortune what is called a man of action as captain dawson realised when he found his entire person a bright peagreen fond as he was of jokes and rhymes nothing he could write or even sing ever satisfied him like something he could do thus it happened that his contribution to the metrical inquiry into the crooked roads was avowedly hasty and flippant while dorian who was of the opposite temper the temper that receives impressions instead of pushing out to make them found his artists love of beauty fulfilled as it had never been before in that noble nest and was far more serious and human than usual patricks verses ran some say that guy of warwick the man that killed the cow and brake the mighty boar alive beyond the bridge at slough went up against a loathly worm that wasted all the downs and so the roads they twist and squirm if i may be allowed the term from the writhing of the stricken worm that died in seven towns i see no scientific proof that this idea is sound and i should say they wound about to find the town of roundabout the merry town of roundabout that makes the world go round some say that robin goodfellow whose lantern lights the meads to steal a phrase sir walter scott in heaven no longer needs such dance around the trystingplace the moonstruck lover leads which superstition i should scout there is more faith in honest doubt as tennyson has pointed out than in those nasty creeds but peace and righteousness st john in roundabout can kiss and since thats all thats found about the pleasant town of roundabout the roads they simply bound about to find out where it is some say that when sir lancelot went forth to find the grail grey merlin wrinkled up the roads for hope that he should fail all roads led back to lyonesse and camelot in the vale i cannot yield assent to this extravagant hypothesis the plain shrewd briton will dismiss such rumours daily mail but in the streets of roundabout are no such factions found or theories to expound about or roll upon the ground about in the happy town of roundabout that makes the world go round patrick dalroy relieved his feelings by finishing with a shout draining a stiff glass of his sailors wine turning restlessly on his elbow and looking across the landscape toward london dorian wimpole had been drinking golden rum and strong starlight and the fragrance of forests and though his verses too were burlesque he read them more emotionally than was his wont before the roman came to rye or out to severn strode the rolling english drunkard made the rolling english road a reeling road a rolling road that rambles round the shire and after him the parson ran the sexton and the squire a merry road a mazy road and such as we did tread that night we went to birmingham by way of beachy head i knew no harm of bonaparte and plenty of the squire and for to fight the frenchmen i did not much desire but i did bash their baggonets because they came arrayed to straighten out the crooked road an english drunkard made where you and i went down the lane with alemugs in our hands the night we went to glastonbury by way of goodwin sands his sins they were forgiven him or why do flowers run behind him and the hedges all strengthening in the sun the wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which but the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch god pardon us nor harden us we did not see so clear the night we went to bannockburn by way of brighton pier my friends we will not go again or ape an ancient rage or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age but walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth and see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death for there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen before we go to paradise by way of kensal green have you written one hump asked dalroy humphrey who had been scribbling hard under the lamp looked up with a dismal face yes he said but i write under a great disadvantage you see i know why the road curves about and he read very rapidly all on one note the road turned first toward the left where pinkers quarry made the cleft the path turned next toward the right because the mastiff used to bite then left because of slippery height and then again toward the right we could not take the left because it would have been against the laws squire closed it in king williams day because it was a right of way still right to dodge the ridge of chalk where parsons ghost it used to walk till someone parson used to know met him blind drunk in callao then left a long way round to skirt the good land where old doggy burt was owner of the crown and cup and would not give his freehold up right missing the old riverbed they tried to make him take instead right since they say sir gregory went mad and let the gypsies be and so they have their camp secure and though not honest they are poor and that is something then along and first to right no i am wrong second to right of course the first is what the holy sisters cursed and none defy their awful oaths since the policeman lost his clothes because of fairies right again what used to be high toby lane left by the double larch and right until the milestone is in sight because the road is firm and good from past the milestone to the wood and i was told by dr lowe whom mr wimpoles aunt would know who lives at oxford writing books and aint so silly as he looks the romans did that little bit and weve done all the rest of it by which we hardly seem to score left and then forward as before to where they nearly hanged miss browne who told them not to cut her down but loose the rope or let her swing because it was a waste of string left once again by hunkers cleft and right beyond the elm and left by pills right by nineteen nicks and left no no no hump hump hump cried dalroy in a sort of terror dont be exhaustive dont be a scientist hump and lay waste fairyland how long does it go on is there a lot more of it yes said pump in a stony manner there is a lot more of it and its all true inquired dorian wimpole with interest yes replied pump with a smile its all true my complaint exactly said the captain what you want is legends what you want is lies especially at this time of night and on rum like this and on our first and our last holiday what do you think about rum he asked wimpole about this particular rum in this particular tree at this particular moment answered wimpole i think it is the nectar of the younger gods if you ask me in a general synthetic sense what i think of rum well i think its rather rum you find it a trifle sweet i suppose said dalroy with some bitterness sybarite by the way he said abruptly what a silly word that word hedonist is the really selfindulgent people generally like sour things and not sweet bitter things like caviar and curries or what not its the saints who like the sweets at least ive known at least five women who were practically saints and they all preferred sweet champagne look here wimpole shall i tell you the ancient oral legend about the origin of rum i told you what you wanted was legends be careful to preserve this one and hand it on to your children for unfortunately my parents carelessly neglected the duty of handing it on to me after the words a farmer had three sons all that i owe to tradition ceases but when the three boys last met in the village marketplace they were all sucking sugarsticks nevertheless they were all discontented and on that day parted for ever one remained on his fathers farm hungering for his inheritance one went up to london to seek his fortune as fortunes are found today in that town forgotten of god the third ran away to sea and the first two flung away their sugarsticks in shame and he on the farm was always drinking smaller and sourer beer for the love of money and he that was in town was always drinking richer and richer wines that men might see that he was rich but he who ran away to sea actually ran on board with the sugarstick in his mouth and st peter or st andrew or whoever is the patron of men in boats touched it and turned it into a fountain for the comfort of men upon the sea that is the sailors theory of the origin of rum inquiry addressed to any busy captain with a new crew in the act of shipping an unprecedented cargo will elicit a sympathetic agreement your rum at least said dorian goodhumouredly may well produce a fairytale but indeed i think all this would have been a fairytale without it patrick raised himself from his arboreal throne and leaned against his branch with a curious and sincere sense of being rebuked yours was a good poem he said with seeming irrelevance and mine was a bad one mine was bad partly because im not a poet as you are but almost as much because i was trying to make up another song at the same time and it went to another tune you see he looked out over the rolling roads and said almost to himself in the city set upon slime and loam they cry in their parliament who goes home and there is no answer in arch or dome for none in the city of graves goes home yet these shall perish and understand for god has pity on this great land men that are men again who goes home tocsin and trumpeter who goes home for theres blood on the field and blood on the foam and blood on the body when man goes home and a voice valedictory who is for victory who is for liberty who goes home softly and idly as he had said this second rhyme there were circumstances about his attitude that must have troubled or interested anyone who did not know him well may i ask asked dorian laughing why it is necessary to draw your sword at this stage of the affair because we have left the place called roundabout answered patrick and we have come to a place called rightabout and he lifted his sword toward london and the grey glint upon it came from a low grey light in the east chapter xxii the chemistry of mr crooke when the celebrated hibbs next visited the shop of crooke that mystic and criminologist chemist he found the premises were impressively and even amazingly enlarged with decorations in the eastern style indeed it would not have been too much to say that mr crookes shop occupied the whole of one side of a showy street in the west end the other side being a blank faade of public buildings it would be no exaggeration to say that mr crooke was the only shopkeeper for some distance round mr crooke still served in his shop however and politely hastened to serve his customer with the medicine that was customary unfortunately for some reason or other history was in connection with this shop only too prone to repeat itself and after a vague but soothing conversation with the chemist on the subject of vitriol and its effects on human happiness mr hibbs experienced the acute annoyance of once more beholding his most intimate friend mr joseph leveson enter the same fashionable emporium but indeed levesons own annoyance was much too acute for him to notice any on the part of hibbs well he said stopping dead in the middle of the shop here is a fine confounded kettle of fish it is one of the tragedies of the diplomatic that they are not allowed to admit either knowledge or ignorance so hibbs looked gloomily wise and said pursing his lips you mean the general situation i mean the situation about this everlasting business of the innsigns said leveson impatiently lord ivywood went up specially when his leg was really bad to get it settled in the house in a small noncontentious bill providing that the sign shouldnt be enough if the liquor hadnt been on the spot three days oh but said hibbs sinking his voice to a soft solemnity as being one of the initiate a thing like that can be managed dont you know of course it can said the other still with the same slightly irritable air it was but it doesnt seem to occur to you any more than it did to his lordship that there is rather a weak point after all in this business of passing acts quietly because theyre unpopular has it ever occurred to you that if a law is really kept too quiet to be opposed it may also be kept too quiet to be obeyed its not so easy to hush it up from a big politician without running the risk of hushing it up even from a common policeman but surely that cant happen by the nature of things cant it by god said j leveson appealing to a less pantheistic authority he unfolded a number of papers from his pocket chiefly cheap local newspapers but some of them letters and telegrams listen to this he said a curious incident occurred in the village of poltwell in surrey yesterday morning the bakers shop of mr whiteman was suddenly besieged by a knot of the looser types of the locality who appear to have demanded beer instead of bread basing their claim on some ornamental object erected outside the shop which object they asserted to be a signboard within the meaning of the act there you see they havent even heard of the new act what do you think of this from the clapton conservator the contempt of socialists for the law was well illustrated yesterday when a crowd collected round some wooden ensign of socialism set up before mr dugdales drapery stores refused to disperse though told that their action was contrary to the law eventually the malcontents joined the procession following the wooden emblem and what do you say to this stoppress news a chemist in pimlico has been invaded by a huge crowd demanding beer and asserting the provision of it to be among his duties the chemist is of course well acquainted with his immunities in the matter especially under the new act but the old notion of the importance of the sign seems still to possess the populace and even to a certain extent to paralyze the police what do you say to that isnt it as plain as monday morning that this flying inn has flown a day in front of us as all such lies do there was a diplomatic silence well asked the still angry leveson of the still dubious hibbs what do you make of all that one illacquainted with that relativity essential to all modern minds might possibly have fancied that mr hibbs could not make much of it however that may be his explanations or incapacity for explanations were soon tested with a fairly positive test for lord ivywood actually walked into the shop of mr crooke good day gentlemen he said looking at them with an expression which they both thought baffling and even a little disconcerting good morning mr crooke i have a celebrated visitor for you and he introduced the smiling misysra the prophet had fallen back on a comparatively quiet costume this morning a mere matter of purple and orange or what not but his aged face was now perennially festive the cause progresses he said everywhere the cause progresses you heard his lordships beauutiful speech i have heard many said hibbs gracefully that can be so described the prophet means what i was saying about the ballot paper amendment act said ivywood casually it seems to be the alphabet of statesmanship to recognise now that the great oriental british empire has become one corporate whole with the occidental one look at our universities with their mohammedan students soon they may be a majority now are we he went on still more quietly are we to rule this country under the forms of representative government i do not pretend to believe in democracy as you know but i think it would be extremely unsettling and incalculable to destroy representative government if we are to give moslem britain representative government we must not make the mistake we made about the hindoos and military organization which led to the mutiny we must not ask them to make a cross on their ballot papers for though it seems a small thing it may offend them so i brought in a little bill to make it optional between the oldfashioned cross and an upward curved mark that might stand for a crescent and as its rather easier to make i believe it will be generally adopted and so said the radiant old turk the little light easily made curly mark is substituted for the hard difficult doublemade cutting both ways mark it is the more good for hygieene for you must know and indeed our good and wise chemist will tell you that the saracenic and the arabian and the turkish physicians were the first of all physicians and taught all medicals to the barbarians of the frankish territories and many of the moost modern the moost fashionable remedies are thus of the oriental origin yes that is quite true said crooke in his rather cryptic and unsympathetic way the powder called arenine lately popularised by mr boze now lord helvellyn who tried it first on birds is made of plain desert sand and what you see in prescriptions as cannabis indiensis is what our lively neighbours of asia describe more energetically as bhang and soo in the saame way said misysra making soothing passes with his brown hand like a mesmerist in the saame way the making of the crescent is hygienic the making of the cross is nonhygienic the crescent was a little wave as a leaf as a little curling feather and he waved his hand with real artistic enthusiasm toward the capering curves of the new turkish decoration which ivywood had made fashionable in many of the fashionable shops but when you make the cross you must make the one line soo and he swept the horizon with the brown hand and then you must go back and make the other line soo and he made an upward gesture suggestive of one constrained to lift a pinetree and then you become very ill as a matter of fact mr crooke said ivywood in his polite manner i brought the prophet here to consult you as the best authority on the very point you have just mentioned the use of hashish or the hempplant i have it on my conscience to decide whether these oriental stimulants or sedatives shall come under the general veto we are attempting to impose on the vulgar intoxicants of course one has heard of the horrible and voluptuous visions and a kind of insanity attributed to the assassins and the old man of the mountain but on the one hand we must clearly discount much for the illimitable prochristian bias with which the history of these eastern tribes is told in this country would you say the effect of hashish was extremely bad and he turned first to the prophet you will see mosques said that seer with candour many mosques more mosques taller and taller mosques till they reach the moon and you bear a dreadful voice in the very high mosque calling the muezzin and you will think it is allah then you will see wives many many wives more wives than you yet have then you will be rolled over and over in a great pink and purple sea which is still wives then you will go to sleep i have only done it once he concluded mildly and what do you think about hashish mr crooke asked ivywood thoughtfully i think its hemp at both ends said the chemist i fear said lord ivywood i dont quite understand you a hempen drink a murder and a hempen rope thats my experience in india said mr crooke it is true said ivywood yet more reflectively that the thing is not moslem in any sense in its origin there is that against the assassins always and of course he added with a simplicity that had something noble about it their connection with st louis discredits them rather after a space of silence he said suddenly looking at crooke so it isnt the sort of thing you chiefly sell no my lord it isnt what i chiefly sell said the chemist he also looked steadily and the wrinkles of his youngold face were like hieroglyphics the cause progress everywhere it progress cried misysra spreading his arms and relieving a momentary tension of which he was totally unaware the hygienic curve of the crescent will soon superimpose himself for your plus sign you already use him for the short syllables in your dactyl which is doubtless of oriental origin you see the new game he said this so suddenly that everyone turned round to see him produce from his purple clothing a brightly coloured and highly polished apparatus from one of the grand toyshops which on examination seemed to consist of a kind of blue slate in a red and yellow frame a number of divisions being already marked on the slate about seventeen slate pencils with covers of different colours and a vast number of printed instructions stating that it was but recently introduced from the remote east and was called naughts and crescents strangely enough lord ivywood with all his enthusiasm seemed almost annoyed at the emergence of this asiatic discovery more especially as he really wanted to look at mr crooke as hard as mr crooke was looking at him hibbs coughed considerately and said of course all our things came from the east and and he paused being suddenly unable to remember anything but curry to which he was very rightly attached he then remembered christianity and mentioned that too everything from the east is good of course he ended with an air of light omniscience those who in later ages and other fashions failed to understand how misysra had ever got a mental hold on men like lord ivywood left out two elements in the man which are very attractive especially to other men one was that there was no subject on which the little turk could not instantly produce a theory the other was that though the theories were crowded they were consistent he was never known to accept an illogical compliment you are in error he said solemnly to hibbs because you say all things from the east are good there is the east wind i do not like him he is not good and i think very much that all the warmth and all the wealthiness and the colours and the poems and the religiousness that the east was meant to give you have been much poisoned by this accident this east wind when you see the green flag of the prophet you do not think of a green field in summer you think of a green wave in your seas of winter for you think it blown by the east wind when you read of the moonfaced houris you think not of our moons like oranges but of your moons like snowballs here a new voice contributed to the conversation its contribution though imperfectly understood appeared to be nar why shd i wite for a little jew in is dressin gown little jews in their dressin gowns as their drinks and we as our drinks bitter miss the speaker who appeared to be a powerful person of the plastering occupation looked round for the unmarried female he had ceremonially addressed and seemed honestly abashed that she was not present ivywood looked at the man with that expression of one turned to stone which his physique made so effective in him but j leveson secretary could summon no such powers of selfpetrification upon his soul the slaughter red of that unhallowed eve arose when first the ship and he were foes when he discovered that the poor are human beings and therefore are polite and brutal within a comparatively short space of time he saw that two other men were standing behind the plastering person one of them apparently urging him to counsels of moderation which was an ominous sign and then he lifted his eyes and saw something worse than any omen all the glass frontage of the shop was a cloud of crowding faces they could not be clearly seen since night was closing in on the street and the dazzling fires of ruby and amethyst which the lighted shop gave to its great globes of liquid rather veiled than revealed them but the foremost actually flattened and whitened their noses on the glass and the most distant were nearer than mr leveson wanted them also he saw a shape erect outside the shop the shape of an upright staff and a square board he could not see what was on the board he did not need to see those who saw lord ivywood at such moments understood why he stood out so strongly in the history of his time in spite of his frozen face and his fanciful dogmas he had all the negative nobility that is possible to man unlike nelson and most of the great heroes he knew not fear thus he was never conquered by a surprise but was cold and collected when other men had lost their heads even if they had not lost their nerve i will not conceal from you gentlemen said lord ivywood that i have been expecting this i will not even conceal from you that i have been occupying mr crookes time until it occurred so far from excluding the crowd i suggest it would be an excellent thing if mr crooke could accommodate them all in this shop i want to tell as soon as possible as large a crowd as possible that the law is altered and this folly about the flying inn has ceased come in all of you come in and listen thank yer said a man connected in some way with motor buses who lurched in behind the plasterer thanky sir said a bright little clockmender from croydon who immediately followed him thanks said a rather bewildered clerk from camberwell who came next in the rather bewildered procession thank you said mr dorian wimpole who entered carrying a large round cheese thank you said captain dalroy who entered carrying a large cask of rum thank you very much said mr humphrey pump who entered the shop carrying the sign of the old ship i fear it must be recorded that the crowd which followed them dispensed with all expressions of gratitude but though the crowd filled the shop so that there was no standing room to spare leveson still lifted his gloomy eyes and beheld his gloomy omen for though there were very many more people standing in the shop there seemed to be no less people looking in at the window gentlemen said ivywood all jokes come to an end this one has gone so far as to be serious and it might have become impossible to correct public opinion and expound to lawabiding citizens the true state of the law had i not been able to meet so representative an assembly in so central a place it is not pertinent to my purpose to indicate what i think of the jest which captain dalroy and his friends have been playing upon you for the last few weeks but i think captain dalroy will himself concede that i am not jesting with all my heart said dalroy in a manner that was unusually serious and even sad then he added with a sigh and as you truly say my jest has come to an end that wooden sign said ivywood pointing at the queer blue ship can be cut up for firewood it shall lead decent citizens a devils dance no more understand it once and for all before you learn it from policemen or prison warders you are under a new law that sign is the sign of nothing you can no more buy and sell alcohol by having that outside your house than if it were a lamppost dyou meanter say guvner said the plasterer with a dawn of intelligence on his large face which was almost awful to watch that i aint to ave a glass o bitter try a glass of rum said patrick captain dalroy said lord ivywood if you give one drop from that cask to that man you are breaking the law and you shall sleep in jail are you quite sure asked dalroy with a strange sort of anxiety i might escape i am quite sure said ivywood i have posted the police with full powers for the purpose as you will find i mean that this business shall end here tonight if i find that pleeceman what told me i could ave a drink just now ill knock is elmet into a fancy necktie i will said the plasterer why aint people allowed to know the law they aint got no right to alter the law in the dark like that said the clockmender damn the new law what is the new law asked the clerk the words inserted by the recent act said lord ivywood with the cold courtesy of the conqueror are to the effect that alcohol cannot be sold even under a lawful sign unless alcoholic liquors have been kept for three days on the premises captain dalroy that cask of yours has not i think been three days on these premises i command you to seal it up and take it away surely said patrick with an innocent air the best remedy would be to wait till it has been three days on the premises we might all get to know each other better and he looked round at the everincreasing multitude with hazy benevolence you shall do nothing of the kind said his lordship with sudden fierceness well answered patrick wearily now i come to think of it perhaps i wont ill have one drink here and go home to bed like a good little boy and the constables shall arrest you thundered ivywood why nothing seems to suit you said the surprised dalroy thank you however for explaining the new law so clearly unless alcoholic liquors have been three days on the premises i shall remember it now you always explain such things so clearly you only made one legal slip the constables will not arrest me and why not demanded the nobleman white with passion because cried patrick dalroy and his voice lifted itself like a lonely trumpet before the charge because i shall not have broken the law because alcoholic liquors have been three days on these premises three months more likely because this is a common grogshop philip ivywood because that man behind the counter lives by selling spirits to all the cowards and hypocrites who are rich enough to bribe a bad doctor and he pointed suddenly at the small medicine glass on the counter by hibbs and leveson what is that man drinking he demanded hibbs put out his hand hastily for his glass but the indignant clockmender had snatched it first and drained it at a gulp scortch he said and dashed the glass to atoms on the floor right you are too roared the plasterer seizing a big medicine bottle in each hand were goin to ave a little of the fun now we are whats in that big red bowl up there i reckon its port fetch it down bill ivywood turned to crooke and said scarcely moving his lips of marble this is a lie it is the truth answered crooke looking back at him with equal steadiness do you think you made the world that you should make it over again so easily the world was made badly said philip with a terrible note in his voice and i will make it over again almost as he spoke the glass front of the shop fell inward shattered and there was wreckage among the moonlike coloured bowls almost as if spheres of celestial crystal cracked at his blasphemy through the broken windows came the roar of that confused tongue that is more terrible than the elements the cry that the deaf kings have heard at last the terrible voice of mankind all the way down the long fashionable street lined with the crooke plateglass that glass was crashing amid the cries of a crowd rivers of gold and purple wines sprawled about the pavement out in the open shouted dalroy rushing out of the shop signboard in hand the dog quoodle barking furiously at his heels while dorian with the cheese and humphrey with the keg followed as rapidly as they could goodnight my lord perhaps our meeting next may fall at tomworth in your castle hall come along friends and form up dont waste time destroying property were all to start now where are we all going to asked the plasterer were all going into parliament answered the captain as he went to the head of the crowd the marching crowd turned two or three corners and at the end of the next long street dorian wimpole who was toward the tail of the procession saw again the grey cyclops tower of st stephens with its one great golden eye as he had seen it against that pale green sunset that was at once quiet and volcanic on the night he was betrayed by sleep and by a friend almost as far off at the head of the procession he could see the sign with the ship and the cross going before them like an ensign and hear a great voice singing men that are men again who goes home tocsin and trumpeter who goes home the voice valedictory who is for victory who is for liberty who goes home chapter xxiii the march on ivywood that stormspirit or eagle of liberty which is the sudden soul in a crowd had descended upon london after a foreign tour of some centuries in which it had commonly alighted upon other capitals it is always impossible to define the instant and the turn of mood which makes the whole difference between danger being worse than endurance and endurance being worse than danger the actual outbreak generally has a symbolic or artistic or what some would call whimsical cause somebody fires off a pistol or appears in an unpopular uniform or refers in a loud voice to a scandal that is never mentioned in the newspapers somebody takes off his hat or somebody doesnt take off his hat and a city is sacked before midnight when the everswelling army of revolt smashed a whole street full of the shops of mr crooke the chemist and then went on to parliament the tower of london and the road to the sea the sociologists hiding in their coalcellars could think in that clarifying darkness of many material and spiritual explanations of such a storm in human souls but of none that explained it quite enough doubtless there was a great deal of sheer drunkenness when the urns and goblets of aesculapius were reclaimed as belonging to bacchus and many who went roaring down that road were merely stored with rich wines and liqueurs which are more comfortably and quietly digested at a city banquet or a west end restaurant but many of these had been blind drunk twenty times without a thought of rebellion you could not stretch the material explanation to cover a corner of the case much more general was a savage sense of the meanness of crookes wealthy patrons in keeping a door open for themselves which they had wantonly shut on less happy people but no explanation can explain it and no man can say when it will come dorian wimpole was at the tail of the procession which grew more and more crowded every moment for one space of the march he even had the misfortune to lose it altogether owing to the startling activity which the rotund cheese when it escaped from his hands showed in descending a somewhat steep road toward the river but in recent days he had gained a pleasure in practical events which was like a second youth he managed to find a stray taxicab and had little difficulty in picking up again the trail of the extraordinary cortge inquiries addressed to a policeman with a black eye outside the house of commons informed him sufficiently of the rebels line of retreat or advance or whatever it was and in a very short time he beheld the unmistakable legion once more it was unmistakable because in front of it there walked a redheaded giant apparently carrying with him a wooden portion of some public building and also because so big a crowd had never followed any man in england for a long time past but except for such things the unmistakable crowd might well have been mistaken for another one its aspect had been altered almost as much as if it had grown horns or tusks for many of the company walked with outlandish weapons like iron teeth or horns bills and pole axes and spears with strangely shaped heads what was stranger still whole rows and rows of them had rifles and even marched with a certain discipline and yet again others seemed to have snatched up household or workshop tools meat axes pick axes hammers and even carving knives such things need be none the less deadly because they are domestic they have figured in millions of private murders before they appeared in any public war dorian was so fortunate as to meet the flamehaired captain almost face to face and easily fell into step with him at the head of the march humphrey pump walked on the other side with the celebrated cask suspended round his neck by something resembling braces as if it were a drum mr wimpole had himself taken the opportunity of his brief estrangement to carry the cheese somewhat more easily in a very large loose waterproof knapsack on his shoulders the effect in both cases was to suggest dreadful deformities in two persons who happened to be exceptionally cleanly built the captain who seemed to be in tearing and towering spirits gained great pleasure from this but dorian had his sources of amusement too what have you been doing with yourselves since you lost my judicious guidance he asked laughing and why are parts of you a dull review and parts of you a fancy dress ball what have you been up to weve been shopping said mr patrick dalroy with some pride we are country cousins i know all about shopping let us see what are the phrases about it look at those rifles now we got them quite at a bargain we went to all the best gunsmiths in london and we didnt pay much in fact we didnt pay anything thats what is called a bargain isnt it surely ive seen in those things they send to ladies something about giving them away then we went to a remnant sale at least it was a remnant sale when we left and we bought that piece of stuff weve tied round the sign surely it must be what ladies called chiffon dorian lifted his eyes and perceived that a very coarse strip of red rag possibly collected from a dust bin had been tied round the wooden signpost by way of a red flag of revolution not what ladies call chiffon inquired the captain with anxiety well anyhow it is what chiffoniers call it but as im going to call on a lady shortly ill try to remember the distinction is your shopping over may i ask asked mr wimpole all but one thing answered the other i must find a music shop you know what i mean place where they sell pianos and things of that sort look here said dorian this cheese is pretty heavy as it is have i got to carry a piano too you misunderstand me said the captain calmly and as he had never thought of music shops until his eye had caught one an instant before he darted into the doorway returning almost immediately with a long parcel under his arm he resumed the conversation did you go anywhere else asked dorian except to shops anywhere else cried patrick indignantly havent you got any country cousins of course we went to all the right places we went to the houses of parliament but parliament isnt sitting so there are no eggs of the quality suitable for elections we went to the tower of london you cant tire country cousins like us we took away some curiosities of steel and iron we even took away the halberds from the beefeaters we pointed out that for the purpose of eating beef their only avowed public object knives and forks had always been found more convenient to tell the truth they seemed rather relieved to be relieved of them and may i ask said the other with a smile where you are off to now another beauty spot cried the captain boisterously no tiring the country cousin i am going to show my young friends from the provinces what is perhaps the finest old country house in england we are going to ivywood not far from that big watering place they call pebblewick i see said dorian and for the first time looked back with intelligent trouble on his face on the marching ranks behind him captain dalroy said dorian wimpole in a slightly altered tone there is one thing that puzzles me ivywood talked about having set the police to catch us and though this is a pretty big crowd i simply cannot believe that the police as i knew them in my youth could not catch us but where are the police you seem to have marched through half london with much if youll excuse me of the appearance of carrying murderous weapons lord ivywood threatened that the police would stop us well why didnt they stop us your subject said patrick cheerfully divides itself into three heads i hope not said dorian there really are three reasons why the police should not be prominent in this business as their worst enemy cannot say that they were he began ticking off the three on his own huge fingers and seemed to be quite serious about it first he said you have been a long time away from town probably you do not know a policeman when you see him they do not wear helmets as our line regiments did after the prussians had won they wear fezzes because the turks have won shortly i have little doubt they will wear pigtails because the chinese have won it is a very interesting branch of moral science it is called efficiency second explained the captain you have perhaps omitted to notice that a very considerable number of those wearing such fezzes are walking just behind us oh yes its quite true dont you remember that the whole french revolution really began because a sort of city militia refused to fire on their own fathers and wives and even showed some slight traces of a taste for firing on the other side youll see lots of them behind and you can tell them by their revolver belts and their walking in step but dont look back on them too much it makes them nervous and the third reason asked dorian for the real reason answered patrick i am not fighting a hopeless fight people who have fought in real fights dont as a rule but i noticed something singular about the very point you mention why are there no more police why are there no more soldiers i will tell you there really are very few policemen or soldiers left in england today surely that said wimpole is an unusual complaint but very clear said the captain gravely to anyone who has ever seen sailors or soldiers i will tell you the truth our rulers have come to count on the bare bodily cowardice of a mass of englishmen as a sheep dog counts on the cowardice of a flock of sheep now look here mr wimpole wouldnt a shepherd be wise to limit the number of his dogs if he could make his sheep pay by it at the end you might find millions of sheep managed by a solitary dog but that is because they are sheep suppose the sheep were turned by a miracle into wolves there are very few dogs they could not tear in pieces but what is my practical point there are really very few dogs to tear you dont mean said dorian that the british army is practically disbanded there are the sentinels outside whitehall replied patrick in a low voice but indeed your question puts me in a difficulty no the army is not entirely disbanded of course but the british army did you ever hear wimpole of the great destiny of the empire i seem to have heard the phrase replied his companion it is in four acts said dalroy victory over barbarians employment of barbarians alliance with barbarians conquest by barbarians that is the great destiny of empire i think i begin to see what you mean returned dorian wimpole of course ivywood and the authorities do seem very prone to rely on the sepoy troops and other troops as well said patrick i think you will be surprised when you see them he tramped on for a while in silence and then said with some air of abruptness which yet did not seem to be entirely a changing of the subject do you know the man who lives now on the estate next to ivywood no replied dorian i am told he keeps himself very much to himself and his estate too said patrick rather gloomily if you would climb his gardenwall wimpole i think you would find an answer to a good many of your questions oh yes the right honourable gentlemen are making full provision for public order and national defence in a way he fell into an almost sullen silence again and several villages had been passed before he spoke again they tramped through the darkness and dawn surprised them somewhere in the wilder and more wooded parts where the roads began to rise and roam dalroy gave an exclamation of pleasure and pointed ahead drawing the attention of dorian to the distance against the silver and scarlet bars of the daybreak could be seen afar a dark purple dome with a crown of dark green leaves the place they had called roundabout dalroys spirit seemed to revive at the sight with the customary accompaniment of the threat of vocalism been making any poems lately he asked of wimpole nothing particular replied the poet then said the captain portentously clearing his throat you shall listen to one of mine whether you like it or not nay the more you dislike it the longer and longer it will be i begin to understand why soldiers want to sing when on the march and also why they put up with such rotten songs the druids waved their golden knives and danced around the oak when they had sacrificed a man but though the learnd search and scan no single modern person can entirely see the joke but though they cut the throats of men they cut not down the tree and from the blood the saplings sprang of oakwoods yet to be but ivywood lord ivywood he rots the tree as ivy would he clings and crawls as ivy would about the sacred tree king charles he fled from worcester fight and hid him in an oak in convent schools no man of tact would trace and praise his every act or argue that he was in fact a strict and sainted bloke but not by him the sacred woods have lost their fancies free and though he was extremely big he did not break the tree but ivywood lord ivywood he breaks the tree as ivy would and eats the woods as ivy would between us and the sea great collingwood walked down the glade and flung the acorns free that oaks might still be in the grove as oaken as the beams above when the great lover sailors love was kissed by death at sea but though for him the oaktrees fell to build the oaken ships the woodman worshipped what he smote and honoured even the chips but ivywood lord ivywood he hates the tree as ivy would as the dragon of the ivy would that has us in his grips they were ascending a sloping road walled in on both sides by solemn woods which somehow seemed as watchful as owls awake though daybreak was going over them with banners scrolls of scarlet and gold and with a wind like trumpets of triumph the dark woods seemed to hold their secret like dark cool cellars nor was the strong sunlight seen in them save in one or two brilliant shafts that looked like splintered emeralds i should not wonder said dorian if the ivy does not find the tree knows a thing or two also the tree does assented the captain the trouble was that until a little while ago the tree did not know that it knew there was a silence and as they went up the incline grew steeper and steeper and the tall trees seemed more and more to be guarding something from sight as with the grey shields of giants do you remember this road hump asked dalroy of the innkeeper yes answered humphrey pump and said no more but few have ever heard such fulness in an affirmative they marched on in silence and about two hours afterward toward eleven oclock dalroy called a halt in the forest and said that everybody had better have a few hours sleep the impenetrable quality in the woods and the comparative softness of the carpet of beechmast made the spot as appropriate as the time was inappropriate and if anyone thinks that common people casually picked up in a street could not follow a random leader on such a journey or sleep at his command in such a spot given the state of the soul then someone knows no history im afraid said dalroy youll have to have your supper for breakfast i know an excellent place for having breakfast but its too exposed for sleep and sleep you must have so we wont unpack the stores just now well lie down like babes in the wood and any bird of an industrious disposition is free to start covering me with leaves really there are things coming before which you will want sleep when they resumed the march it was nearly the middle of the afternoon and the meal which dalroy insisted buoyantly on describing as breakfast was taken about that mysterious hour when ladies die without tea the steep road had consistently grown steeper and steeper and steeper and at last dalroy said to dorian wimpole dont drop that cheese again just here or it will roll right away down into the woods i know it will no scientific calculations of grades and angles are necessary because i have seen it do so myself in fact i have run after it wimpole realised they were mounting to the sharp edge of a ridge and in a few moments he knew by the oddness in the shape of the trees what it had been that the trees were hiding they had been walking along a swelling woodland path beside the sea on a particular high plateau projecting above the shore stood some dwarfed and crippled appletrees of whose apples no man alive would have eaten so sour and salt they must be all the rest of the plateau was bald and featureless but pump looked at every inch of it as if at an inhabited place this is where well have breakfast he said pointing to the naked grassy waste its the best inn in england some of his audience began to laugh but somehow suddenly ceased doing so as dalroy strode forward and planted the sign of the old ship on the desolate seashore and now he said you have charge of the stores we brought hump and we will picnic as it said in a song i once sang the saracens head out of araby came king richard riding in arms like flame and where he established his folk to be fed he set up his spear and the saracens head it was nearly dusk before the mob much swelled by the many discontented on the ivywood estates reached the gates of ivywood house strategically and for the purposes of a night surprise this might have done credit to the captains military capacity but the use to which he put it actually was what some might call eccentric when he had disposed his forces with strict injunctions of silence for the first few minutes he turned to pump and said and now before we do anything else im going to make a noise and he produced from under brown paper what appeared to be a musical instrument a summons to parley inquired dorian with interest a trumpet of defiance or something of that kind no said patrick a serenade chapter xxiv the enigmas of lady joan on an evening when the sky was clear and only its fringes embroidered with the purple arabesques of the sunset joan brett was walking on the upper lawn of the terraced garden at ivywood where the peacocks trail themselves about she was not unlike one of the peacocks herself in beauty and some might have said in inutility she had the proud head and the sweeping train nor was she in these days devoid of the occasional disposition to scream for indeed for some time past she had felt her existence closing round her with an incomprehensible quietude and that is harder for the patience than an incomprehensible noise whenever she looked at the old yew hedges of the garden they seemed to be higher than when she saw them last as if those living walls could still grow to shut her in whenever from the turret windows she had a sight of the sea it seemed to be farther away indeed the whole closing of the end of the turret wing with the new wall of eastern woodwork seemed to symbolise all her shapeless sensations in her childhood the wing had ended with a brokendown door and a disused staircase they led to an uncultivated copse and an abandoned railway tunnel to which neither she nor anyone else ever wanted to go still she knew what they led to now it seemed that this scrap of land had been sold and added to the adjoining estate and about the adjoining estate nobody seemed to know anything in particular the sense of things closing in increased upon her all sorts of silly little details magnified the sensation she could discover nothing about this new landlord next door so to speak since he was it seemed an elderly man who preferred to live in the greatest privacy miss browning lord ivywoods secretary could give her no further information than that he was a gentleman from the mediterranean coast which singular form of words seemed to have been put into her mouth as a mediterranean gentleman might mean anything from an american gentleman living in venice to a black african on the edge of the atlas the description did not illuminate and probably was not intended to do so she occasionally saw his liveried servants going about and their liveries were not like english liveries she was also in her somewhat morbid state annoyed by the fact that the uniforms of the old pebblewick militia had been changed under the influence of the turkish prestige in the recent war they wore fezzes like the french zouaves which were certainly much more practical than the heavy helmets they used to wear it was a small matter but it annoyed lady joan who was like so many clever women at once subtle and conservative it made her feel as if the whole world was being altered outside and she was not allowed to know about it but she had deeper spiritual troubles also while under the pathetic entreaties of old lady ivywood and her own sick mother she stayed on week after week at ivywood house if the matter be stated cynically as she herself was quite capable of stating it she was engaged in the established feminine occupation of trying to like a man but the cynicism would have been false as cynicism nearly always is for during the most crucial days of that period she had really liked the man she had liked him when he was brought in with pumps bullet in his leg and was still the strongest and calmest man in the room she had liked him when the hurt took a dangerous turn and when he bore pain to admiration she had liked him when he showed no malice against the angry dorian she had liked him with something like enthusiasm on the night he rose rigid on his rude crutch and crushing all remonstrance made his rash and swift rush to london but despite the queer closinginsensations of which we have spoken she never liked him better than that evening when he lifted himself laboriously on his crutch up the terraces of the old garden and came to speak to her as she stood among the peacocks he even tried to pat a peacock in a hazy way as if it were a dog he told her that these beautiful birds were of course imported from the east by the semieastern empire of macedonia but all the same joan had a dim suspicion that he had never noticed before that there were any peacocks at ivywood his greatest fault was a pride in the faultlessness of his mental and moral strength but if he had only known something faintly comic in the unconscious side of him did him more good with the woman than all the rest they were said to be the birds of juno he said but i have little doubt that juno like so much else of the homeric mythology has also an asiatic origin i always thought said joan that juno was rather too stately for the seraglio you ought to know replied ivywood with a courteous gesture for i never saw anyone who looked so like juno as you do but indeed there is a great deal of misunderstanding about the arabian or indian view of women it is somehow too simple and solid for our paradoxical christendom to comprehend even the vulgar joke against the turks that they like their brides fat has in it a sort of distorted shadow of what i mean they do not look so much at the individual as at womanhood and the power of nature i sometimes think said joan that these fascinating theories are a little strained your friend misysra told me the other day that women had the highest freedom in turkey as they were allowed to wear trousers ivywood smiled his rare and dry smile the prophet has something of a simplicity often found with genius he answered i will not deny that some of the arguments he has employed have seemed to me crude and even fanciful but he is right at the root there is a kind of freedom that consists in never rebelling against nature and i think they understand it in the orient better than we do in the west you see joan it is all very well to talk about love in our narrow personal romantic way but there is something higher than the love of a lover or the love of love what is that asked joan looking down the love of fate said lord ivywood with something like spiritual passion in his eyes doesnt nietzsche say somewhere that the delight in destiny is the mark of the hero we are mistaken if we think that the heroes and saints of islam say kismet with bowed heads and in sorrow they say kismet with a shout of joy that which is fitting that is what they really mean in the arabian tales the most perfect prince is wedded to the most perfect princess because it is fitting the spiritual giants the genii achieve it that is the purposes of nature in the selfish sentimental european novels the loveliest princess on earth might have run away with her middleaged drawingmaster these things are not in the path the turk rides out to wed the fairest queen of the earth he conquers empires to do it and he is not ashamed of his laurels the crumpled violet clouds around the edge of the silver evening looked to lady joan more and more like vivid violet embroideries hemming some silver curtain in the closed corridor at ivywood the peacocks looked more lustrous and beautiful than they ever had before but for the first time she really felt they came out of the land of the arabian nights joan said philip ivywood very softly in the twilight i am not ashamed of my laurels i see no meaning in what these christians call humility i will be the greatest man in the world if i can and i think i can therefore something that is higher than love itself fate and what is fitting make it right that i should wed the most beautiful woman in the world and she stands among the peacocks and is more beautiful and more proud than they joans troubled eyes were on the violet horizon and her troubled lips could utter nothing but something like dont joan said philip again i have told you you are the woman one of the great heroes could have desired let me now tell you something i could have told no one to whom i had not thus spoken of love and betrothal when i was twenty years old in a town in germany pursuing my education i did what the west calls falling in love she was a fishergirl from the coast for this town was near the sea my story might have ended there i could not have entered diplomacy with such a wife but i should not have minded then but a little while after i wandered into the edges of flanders and found myself standing above some of the last grand reaches of the rhine and things came over me but for which i might be crying stinking fish to this day i thought how many holy or lovely nooks that river had left behind and gone on it might anywhere in switzerland have spent its weak youth in a spirit over a high crag or anywhere in the rhinelands lost itself in a marsh covered with flowers but it went on to the perfect sea which is the fulfilment of a river again joan could not speak and again it was philip who went on here is yet another thing that could not be said till the hand of the prince had been offered to the princess it may be that in the east they carry too far this matter of infant marriages but look round on the mad young marriages that go to pieces everywhere and ask yourself whether you dont wish they had been infant marriages people talk in the newspapers of the heartlessness of royal marriages but you and i do not believe the newspapers i suppose we know there is no king in england nor has been since his head fell before whitehall you know that you and i and the families are the kings of england and our marriages are royal marriages let the suburbs call them heartless let us say they need the brave heart that is the only badge of aristocracy joan he said very gently perhaps you have been near a crag in switzerland or a marsh covered with flowers perhaps you have known a fishergirl but there is something greater and simpler than all that something you find in the great epics of the east the beautiful woman and the great man and fate my lord said joan using the formal phrase by an unfathomable instinct will you allow me a little more time to think of this and let there be no notion of disloyalty if my decision is one way or the other why of course said ivywood bowing over his crutch and he limped off picking his way among the peacocks for days afterward joan tried to build the foundations of her earthly destiny she was still quite young but she felt as if she had lived thousands of years worrying over the same question she told herself again and again and truly that many a better woman than she had taken a secondbest which was not so firstclass a secondbest but there was something complicated in the very atmosphere she liked listening to philip ivywood at his best as anyone likes listening to a man who can really play the violin but the great trouble always is that at certain awful moments you cannot be certain whether it is the violin or the man moreover there was a curious tone and spirit in the ivywood household especially after the wound and convalescence of ivywood about which she could say nothing except that it annoyed her somehow there was something in it glorious but also languorous by an impulse by no means uncommon among intelligent fashionable people she felt a desire to talk to a sensible woman of the middle or lower classes and almost threw herself on the bosom of miss browning for sympathy but miss browning with her curling reddish hair and white very clever face struck the same indescribable note lord ivywood was assumed as a first principle as if he were father time or the clerk of the weather he was called he the fifth time he was called he joan could not understand why she seemed to smell the plants in the hot conservatory you see said miss browning we mustnt interfere with his career that is the important thing and really i think the quieter we keep about everything the better i am sure he is maturing very big plans you heard what the prophet said the other night the last thing the prophet said to me said the darker lady in a dogged manner was that when we english see the english youth we cry out he is crescent but when we see the english aged man we cry out he is cross a lady with so clever a face could not but laugh faintly but she continued on a determined theme the prophet said you know that all real love had in it an element of fate and i am sure that is his view too people cluster round a centre as little stars do round a star because a star is a magnet you are never wrong when destiny blows behind you like a great big wind and i think many things have been judged unfairly that way its all very well to talk about the infant marriages in india miss browning said joan are you interested in the infant marriages in india well said miss browning is your sister interested in them ill run and ask her cried joan plunging across the room to where mrs mackintosh was sitting at a table scribbling secretarial notes well said mrs mackintosh turning up a richhaired resolute head more handsome than her sisters i believe the indian way is the best when people are left to themselves in early youth any of them might marry anything we might have married a nigger or a fishwife or a criminal now mrs mackintosh said joan with blackbrowed severity you well know you would never have married a fishwife where is enid she ended suddenly lady enid said miss browning is looking out music in the music room i think joan walked swiftly through several long salons and found her fairhaired and pallid relative actually at the piano enid cried joan you know ive always been fond of you for gods sake tell me what is the matter with this house i admire philip as everybody does but what is the matter with the house why do all these rooms and gardens seem to be shutting me in and in and in why does everything look more and more the same why does everybody say the same thing oh i dont often talk metaphysics but there is a purpose in this thats the only way of putting it there is a purpose and i dont know what it is lady enid wimpole played a preliminary bar or two on the piano then she said nor do i joan i dont indeed i know exactly what you mean but its just because there is a purpose that i have faith in him and trust him she began softly to play a ballad tune of the rhineland and perhaps the music suggested her next remark suppose you were looking at some of the last reaches of the rhine where it flows enid cried joan if you say into the north sea i shall scream scream do you hear louder than all the peacocks together well expostulated lady enid looking up rather wildly the rhine does flow into the north sea doesnt it i dare say said joan recklessly but the rhine might have flowed into the round pond before you would have known or cared until until what asked enid and her music suddenly ceased until something happened that i cannot understand said joan moving away you are something i cannot understand said enid wimpole but i will play something else if this annoys you and she fingered the music again with an eye to choice joan walked back through the corridor of the music room and restlessly resumed her seat in the room with the two lady secretaries well asked the redhaired and goodhumoured mrs mackintosh without looking up from her work of scribbling have you discovered anything for some moments joan appeared to be in a blacker state of brooding than usual then she said in a candid and friendly tone which somehow contrasted with her knit and swarthy brows no really at least i think ive only found out two things and they are only things about myself ive discovered that i do like heroism but i dont like hero worship surely said miss browning in the girton manner the one always flows from the other i hope not said joan but what else can you do with the hero asked mrs mackintosh still without looking up from her writing except worship him you might crucify him said joan with a sudden return of savage restlessness as she rose from her chair things seem to happen then arent you tired asked the miss browning who had the clever face yes said joan and the worst sort of tiredness when you dont even know what youre tired of to tell the honest truth i think im tired of this house its very old of course and parts of it are still dismal said miss browning but he has enormously improved it the decoration with the moon and stars down in the wing with the turret is really away in the distant music room lady enid having found the music she preferred was fingering its prelude on the piano at the first few notes of it joan brett stood up like a tigress thanks she said with a hoarse softness thats it of course and thats just what we all are shes found the right tune now what tune is it asked the wondering secretary the tune of harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of music said joan softly and fiercely when we shall bow down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king has set up girls women do you know what this place is do you know why it is all doors within doors and lattice behind lattice and everything is curtained and cushioned and why the flowers that are so fragrant here are not the flowers of our hills from the distant and slowly darkening music room enid wimpoles song came thin and clear less than the dust beneath thy chariot wheel less than the rust that never stained thy sword do you know what we are demanded joan brett again we are a harem why what can you mean cried the younger girl in great agitation why lord ivywood has never i know he has never i am not sure said joan even whether he would ever i shall never understand that man nor will anybody else but i tell you that is the spirit that is what we are and this room stinks of polygamy as certainly as it smells of tuberoses why joan cried lady enid entering the room like a wellbred ghost what on earth is the matter with you you all look as white as sheets joan took no heed of her but went on with her own obstinate argument and besides she said if theres one thing we do know about him it is that he believes on principle in doing things slowly he calls it evolution and relativity and the expanding of an idea into larger ideas how do we know he isnt doing that slowly getting us accustomed to living like this so that it may be the less shock when he goes further steeping us in the atmosphere before he actually introduces and she shuddered the institution is it any more calmly outrageous a scheme than any other of ivywoods schemes than a sepoy commanderinchief or misysra preaching in westminster abbey or the destruction of all the inns in england i will not wait and expand i will not be evolved i will not develop into something that is not me my feet shall be outside these walls if i walk the roads for it afterward or i will scream as i would scream trapped in any den by the docks she swept down the rooms toward the turret with a sudden passion for solitude but as she passed the astronomical woodcarving that had closed up the end of the old wing enid saw her strike it with her clinched hand it was in the turret that she had a strange experience she was again later on using its isolation to worry out the best way of having it out with philip when he should return from his visit to london for to tell old lady ivywood what was on her mind would be about as kind and useful as describing chinese tortures to a baby the evening was very quiet of the pale grey sort and all that side of ivywood lay before her eyes undisturbed she was the more surprised when her dreaming took note of a sort of stirring in the greypurple dusk of the bushes of whisperings and of many footsteps then the silence settled down again and then it was startlingly broken by a big voice singing in the dark distance it was accompanied by faint sounds that might have been from the fingering of some lute or viol lady the light is dying in the skies lady and let us die when honour dies your dear dropped glove was like a gauntlet flung when you and i were young for something more than splendour stood and ease was not the only good about the woods in ivywood when you and i were young lady the stars are falling pale and small lady we will not live if life be all forgetting those good stars in heaven hung when all the world was young for more than gold was in a ring and love was not a little thing between the trees in ivywood when all the world was young the singing ceased and the bustle in the bushes could hardly be called more than a whisper but sounds of the same sort and somewhat louder seemed wafted round corners from other sides of the house and the whole night seemed full of something that was alive but was more than a single man she heard a cry behind her and enid rushed into the room as white as one of the lilies what awful thing is happening she cried the courtyard is full of men shouting and there are torches everywhere and joan heard a tramp of men marching and heard afar off another song sung on a more derisive note something like but ivywood lord ivywood he rots the tree as ivy would i think said joan thoughtfully it is the end of the world but where are the police wailed her cousin they dont seem to be anywhere about since they wore those fezzes we shall be murdered or three thundering and measured blows shook the decorative wood panelling at the end of the wing as if admittance were demanded with the club of a giant enid remembered that she had thought joans little blow energetic and shuddered both the girls stared at the stars and moons and suns blazoned on that sacred wall that leapt and shuddered under the strokes of the doom then the sun fell from heaven and the moon and stars dropped down and were scattered about the persian carpet and by the opening of the end of the world patrick dalroy came in carrying a mandolin chapter xxv the finding of the superman ive brought you a little dog said mr dalroy introducing the rampant quoodle i had him brought down here in a large hamper labelled explosives a title which appears to have been well selected he had bowed to lady enid on entering and taken joans hand with the least suggestion that he wanted to do something else with it but he resolutely resumed his conversation which was on the subject of dogs people who bring back dogs he said are always under a cloud of suspicion sometimes it is hideously hinted that the citizen who brings the dog back with him is identical with the citizen who took the dog away with him in my case of course such conduct is inconceivable but the returners of dogs that prosperous and increasing class are also accused he went on looking straight at joan with blank blue eyes of coming back for a reward there is more truth in this charge then with a change of manner more extraordinary than any revolution even the revolution that was roaring round the house he took her hand again and kissed it saying with a confounding seriousness i know at least that you will pray for my soul you had better pray for mine if i have one answered joan but why now because said patrick you will hear from outside you may even see from that turret window something which in brute fact has never been seen in england since poor monmouths army went down in spirit and in truth it has not happened since saladin and coeur de lion crashed together i only add one thing and that you know already i have lived loving you and i shall die loving you it is the only dimension of the universe in which i have not wandered and gone astray i leave the dog to guard you and he disappeared down the old broken staircase lady enid was much mystified that no popular pursuit assailed this stair or invaded the house but lady joan knew better she had gone on the suggestion she most cared about into the turret room and looked out of its many windows on to the abandoned copse and tunnel which were now fenced off with high walls the boundary of the mysterious property next door across that high barrier she could not even see the tunnel and barely the tops of the tallest trees which hid its entrance from sight but in an instant she knew that dalroy was not hurling his forces on ivywood at all but on the house and estate beyond it and then followed a sight that was not an experience but rather a revolving vision she could never describe it afterward nor could any of those involved in so violent and mystical a wheel she had seen a huge wall of a breaker wash all over the parade at pebblewick and wondered that so huge a hammer could be made merely of water she had never had a notion of what it is like when it is made of men the palisade put up by the new landlord in front of the old tangled ground by the tunnel she had long regarded as something as settled and ordinary as one of the walls of the drawing room it swung and split and sprang into a thousand pieces under the mere blow of human bodies bursting with rage and the great wave crested the obstacle more clearly than she had ever seen any great wave crest the parade only when the fence was broken she saw behind it something that robbed her of reason so that she seemed to be living in all ages and all lands at once she never could describe the vision afterward but she always denied it was a dream she said it was worse it was something more real than reality it was a line of real soldiers which is always a magnificent sight but they might have been the soldiers of hannibal or of attila they might have been dug up from the cemeteries of sidon and babylon for all joan had to do with them there encamped in english meadows with a hawthorntree in front of them and three beeches behind was something that has never been in camp nearer than some leagues south of paris since that carolus called the hammer broke it backward at tours there flew the green standard of that great faith and strong civilization which has so often almost entered the great cities of the west which long encircled vienna which was barely barred from paris but which had never before been seen in arms on the soil of england at one end of the line stood philip ivywood in a uniform of his own special creation a compromise between the sepoy and the turkish uniform the compromise worked more and more wildly in joans mind if any impression remained it was merely that england had conquered india and turkey had conquered england then she saw that ivywood for all his uniform was not the commander of these forces for an old man with a great scar on his face which was not a european face set himself in the front of the battle as if it had been a battle in the old epics and crossed swords with patrick dalroy he had come to return the scar upon his forehead and he returned it with many wounds though at last it was he who sank under the sword thrust he fell on his face and dalroy looked at him with something that is much more great than pity blood was flowing from patricks wrist and forehead but he made a salute with his sword as he was doing so the corpse as it appeared laboriously lifted a face with feeble eyelids and seeming to understand the quarters of the sky by instinct oman pasha dragged himself a foot or so to the left and fell with his face toward mecca after that the turret turned round and round about joan and she knew not whether the things she saw were history or prophecy something in that last fact of being crushed by the weapons of brown men and yellow secretly entrenched in english meadows had made the english what they had not been for centuries the hawthorntree was twisted and broken as it was at the battle of ashdown when alfred led his first charge against the danes the beechtrees were splashed up to their lowest branches with the mingling of brave heathen and brave christian blood she knew no more than that when a column of the christian rebels led by humphrey of the sign of the ship burst through the choked and forgotten tunnel and took the turkish regiment in the rear it was the end that violent and revolving vision became something beyond the human voice or human ear she could not intelligently hear even the shots and shouts round the last magnificent rally of the turks it was natural therefore that she should not hear the words lord ivywood addressed to his nextdoor neighbour a turkish officer or rather to himself but his words were i have gone where god has never dared to go i am above the silly supermen as they are above mere men where i walk in the heavens no man has walked before me and i am alone in a garden all this passing about me is like the lonely plucking of garden flowers i will have this blossom i will have that the sentence ended so suddenly that the officer looked at him as if expecting him to speak but he did not speak but patrick and joan wandering together in a world made warm and fresh again as it can be for few in a world that calls courage frenzy and love superstition feeling every branching tree as a friend with arms open for the man or every sweeping slope as a great train trailing behind the woman did one day climb up to the little white cottage that was now the home of the superman he sat playing with a pale reposeful face with scraps of flower and weed put before him on a wooden table he did not notice them nor anything else around him scarcely even enid wimpole who attended to all his wants he is perfectly happy she said quietly joan with the glow on her dark face could not prevent herself from replying and we are so happy yes said enid but his happiness will last and she wept i understand said joan and kissed her cousin not without tears of her own
