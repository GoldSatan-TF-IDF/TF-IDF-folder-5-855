the headswoman i it was a bland sunny morning of a medival may an oldstyle may of the most typical quality and the council of the little town of st radegonde were assembled as was their wont at that hour in the picturesque upper chamber of the htel de ville for the dispatch of the usual municipal business though the date was early sixteenth century the members of this particular towncouncil possessed considerable resemblance to those of similar assemblies in the seventeenth eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries in a general absence of any characteristic at all unless a pervading hopeless insignificance can be considered as such all the character in the room indeed seemed to be concentrated in the girl who stood before the table erect yet at her ease facing the members in general and mr mayor in particular a delicatehanded handsome girl of some eighteen summers whose tall supple figure was well set off by the quiet though tasteful mourning in which she was clad well gentlemen the mayor was saying this little business appears to be er quite in order and it only remains for me to er review the facts you are aware that the town has lately had the misfortune to lose its executioner a gentleman who i may say performed the duties of his office with neatness and dispatch and gave the fullest satisfaction to all with whom he er came in contact but the council has already in a vote of condolence expressed its sense of the er striking qualities of the deceased you are doubtless also aware that the office is hereditary being secured to a particular family in this town so long as any one of its members is ready and willing to take it up the deed lies before me and appears to be er quite in order it is true that on this occasion the council might have been called upon to consider and examine the title of the claimant the late lamented official having only left a daughter she who now stands before you but i am happy to say that jeanne the young lady in question with what i am bound to call great goodfeeling on her part has saved us all trouble in that respect by formally applying for the family post with all its er duties privileges and emoluments and her application appears to be er quite in order there is therefore under the circumstances nothing left for us to do but to declare the said applicant duly elected i would wish however before i er sit down to make it quite clear to the er fair petitioner that if a laudable desire to save the council trouble in the matter has led her to a er hasty conclusion it is quite open to her to reconsider her position should she determine not to press her claim the succession to the post would then apparently devolve upon her cousin enguerrand well known to you all as a practising advocate in the courts of this town though the youth has not i admit up to now proved a conspicuous success in the profession he has chosen still there is no reason why a bad lawyer should not make an excellent executioner and in view of the close friendship may i even say attachment existing between the cousins it is possible that this young lady may in due course practically enjoy the solid emoluments of the position without the necessity of discharging its to some girls uncongenial duties and so though not the rose herself she would still be er near the rose and the mayor resumed his seat chuckling over his little pleasantry which the keener wits of the council proceeded to explain at length to the more obtuse permit me mr mayor said the girl quietly first to thank you for what was evidently the outcome of a kindly though misdirected feeling on your part and then to set you right as to the grounds of my application for the post to which you admit my hereditary claim as to my cousin your conjecture as to the feeling between us is greatly exaggerated and i may further say at once from my knowledge of his character that he is little qualified either to adorn or to dignify an important position such as this a man who has achieved such indifferent success in a minor and less exacting walk of life is hardly likely to shine in an occupation demanding punctuality concentration judgment all the qualities in fine that go to make a good business man but this is beside the question my motive gentlemen in demanding what is my due is a simple and i trust an honest one and i desire that there should be no misunderstanding it is my wish to be dependent on no one i am both willing and able to work and i only ask for what is the common right of humanity admission to the labour market how many poor toiling women would simply jump at a chance like this which fortune by the accident of birth lays open to me and shall i from any false deference to that conventional voice which proclaims this thing as nice and that thing as not nice reject a handicraft which promises me both artistic satisfaction and a competence no gentlemen my claim is a small one only a fair days wage for a fair days work but i can accept nothing less nor consent to forgo my rights even for any contingent remainder of possible cousinly favour there was a touch of scorn in her fine contralto voice as she finished speaking the mayor himself beamed approval he was not wealthy and had a large family of daughters so jeannes sentiments seemed to him entirely right and laudable well gentlemen he began briskly then all weve got to do is to beg pardon your worship put in master robinet the tanner who had been sitting with a petrified billthelizard sort of expression during the speechifying but are we to understand as how this here young lady is going to be the public executioner of this here town really neighbour robinet said the mayor somewhat pettishly youve got ears like the rest of us i suppose and you know the contents of the deed and youve had my assurance that its er quite in order and as its getting towards lunchtime but its unheard of protested honest robinet there hasnt ever been no such thing leastways not as ive heard tell illustration you see i am familiar with the routine goodmorning gentlemen well well well said the mayor everything must have a beginning i suppose times are different now you know theres the march of intellect and er all that sort of thing we must advance with the times dont you see robinet advance with the times well im began the tanner but no one heard on this occasion the tanners opinion as to his condition physical or spiritual for the clear contralto cut short his obtestations if theres really nothing more to be said mr mayor she remarked i need not trespass longer on your valuable time i propose to take up the duties of my office tomorrow morning at the usual hour the salary will i assume be reckoned from the same date and i shall make the customary quarterly application for such additional emoluments as may have accrued to me during that period you see i am familiar with the routine goodmorning gentlemen and as she passed from the council chamber her small head held erect even the tanner felt that she took with her a large portion of the may sunshine which was condescending that morning to gild their deliberations ii one evening a few weeks later jeanne was taking a stroll on the ramparts of the town a favourite and customary walk of hers when business cares were over the pleasant expanse of country that lay spread beneath her the rich sunset the gleaming sinuous river and the noble old chteau that dominated both town and pasture from its adjacent height all served to stir and bring out in her those poetic impulses which had lain dormant during the working day while the cool evening breeze smoothed out and obliterated any little jars or worries which might have ensued during the practice of a profession in which she was still something of a novice this evening she felt fairly happy and content true business was rather brisk and her days had been fully occupied but this mattered little so long as her modest efforts were appreciated and she was now really beginning to feel that with practice her work was creditably and artistically done in a satisfied somewhat dreamy mood she was drinking in the various sweet influences of the evening when she perceived her cousin approaching goodevening enguerrand cried jeanne pleasantly she was thinking that since she had begun to work for her living she had hardly seen him and they used to be such good friends could anything have occurred to offend him enguerrand drew near somewhat moodily but could not help allowing his expression to relax at sight of her fair young face set in its framework of rich brown hair wherein the sunset seemed to have tangled itself and to cling reluctant to leave it sit down enguerrand continued jeanne and tell me what youve been doing this long time been very busy and winning forensic fame and gold well not exactly said enguerrand moody once more the fact is theres so much interest required nowadays at the courts that unassisted talent never gets a chance and you jeanne oh i dont complain answered jeanne lightly of course its fairtime just now you know and were always busy then but work will be lighter soon and then ill get a day off and well have a delightful ramble and picnic in the woods as we used to do when we were children what fun we had in those old days enguerrand do you remember when we were quite little tots and used to play at executions in the backgarden and you were a bandit and a buccaneer and all sorts of dreadful things and i used to chop off your head with a paperknife how pleased dear father used to be jeanne said enguerrand with some hesitation youve touched upon the very subject that i came to speak to you about do you know dear i cant help feeling it may be unreasonable but still the feeling is there that the profession you have adopted is not quite is just a little now enguerrand said jeanne an angry flash sparkling in her eyes she was a little touchy on this subject the word she most affected to despise being also the one she most dreaded the adjective unladylike dont misunderstand me jeanne went on enguerrand imploringly you may naturally think that because i should have succeeded to the post with its income and perquisites had you relinquished your claim there is therefore some personal feeling in my remonstrances believe me it is not so my own interests do not weigh with me for a moment it is on your account jeanne and yours alone that i ask you to consider whether the higher sthetic qualities which i know you possess may not become cramped and thwarted by the trivial round the common task which you have lightly undertaken however laudable a professional life may be one always feels that with a delicate organism such as woman some of the bloom may possibly get rubbed off the peach well enguerrand said jeanne composing herself with an effort though her lips were set hard i will do you the justice to believe that personal advantage does not influence you and i will try to reason calmly with you and convince you that you are simply hidebound by oldworld prejudice now take yourself for instance who come here to instruct me what does your profession amount to when alls said and done a mass of lies quibbles dodges and tricks that would make any selfrespecting executioner blush and even with the dirty weapons at your command you make but a poor show of it there was that wretched fellow you defended only two days ago i was in court during the trial professional interest you know well he had his regular alibi all ready as clear as clear could be only you must needs go and mess and bungle the thing up so that just as i expected all along he was passed on to me for treatment in due course you may like to have his opinion that of a shrewd though unlettered person its a real pleasure miss he said to be handled by you you knows your work and you does your work though praps i ses it as shouldnt if that blooming fool of a mouthpiece of mine he was referring to you dear in your capacity of advocate had known his business half as well as you do yours i shouldnt a bin here now and you know enguerrand he was perfectly right well perhaps he was admitted enguerrand you see i had been working at a sonnet the night before and i couldnt get the rhymes right and they would keep coming into my head in court and mixing themselves up with the alibi but look here jeanne when you saw i was going off the track you might have given me a friendly hint you know for old times sake if not for the prisoners i daresay replied jeanne calmly perhaps youll tell me why i should sacrifice my interests because youre unable to look after yours you forget that i receive a bonus over and above my salary upon each exercise of my functions true said enguerrand gloomily i did forget that i wish i had your business aptitudes jeanne i daresay you do remarked jeanne but you see dear how all your arguments fall to the ground you mistake a prepossession for a logical base now if i had gone like that clairette you used to dangle after and been waitingwoman to some grand lady in a chteau a thinblooded compound of drudge and sycophant then i suppose youd have been perfectly satisfied so feminine so genteel shes not a bad sort of girl little claire said enguerrand reflectively thereby angering jeanne afresh but putting her aside of course you could always beat me at argument jeanne youd have made a much better lawyer than i but you know dear how much i care about you and i did hope that on that account even a prejudice however unreasonable might have some little weight and im not alone let me tell you in my views there was a fellow in court only today who was saying that yours was only a succs destime and that woman as a naturally talkative and hopelessly unpunctual animal could never be more than a clever amateur in the profession you have chosen that will do enguerrand said jeanne proudly it seems that when argument fails you can stoop so low as to insult me through my sex you men are all alike steeped in brutish masculine prejudice now go away and dont mention the subject to me again till youre quite reasonable and nice iii jeanne passed a somewhat restless night after her small scene with her cousin waking depressed and unrefreshed though she had carried matters with so high a hand and had scored so distinctly all around she had been more agitated than she had cared to show she liked enguerrand and more especially did she like his admiration for her and that chance allusion to clairette contained possibilities that were alarming in embracing a professional career she had never thought for a moment that it could militate against that due share of admiration to which as a girl she was justly entitled and enguerrands views seemed this morning all the more narrow and inexcusable she rose languidly and as soon as she was dressed sent off a little note to the mayor saying that she had a nervous headache and felt out of sorts and begging to be excused from attendance on that day and the missive reached the mayor just as he was taking his usual place at the head of the board dear dear said the kindhearted old man as soon as he had read the letter to his fellowcouncilmen im very sorry poor girl here one of you fellows just run round and tell the gaoler there wont be any business today jeannes seedy its put off till tomorrow and now gentlemen the agenda really your worship exploded robinet this is simply ridiculous upon my word robinet said the mayor i dont know whats the matter with you heres a poor girl unwell and a more hardworking girl isnt in the town and instead of sympathising with her and saying youre sorry you call it ridiculous suppose you had a headache yourself you wouldnt like but it is ridiculous maintained the tanner stoutly who ever heard of an executioner having a nervous headache theres no precedent for it and out of sorts too suppose the criminals said they were out of sorts and didnt feel up to being executed well suppose they did replied the mayor wed try and meet them halfway i daresay theyd have to be executed some time or other you know why on earth are you so captious about trifles the prisoners wont mind and i dont mind nobodys inconvenienced and everybodys happy youre right there mr mayor put in another councilman this executing business used to give the town a lot of trouble and bother now its all as easy as kissyourhand instead of objecting as they used to do and wanting to argue the point and kick up a row the fellows as is told off for execution come skipping along in the morning like a lot of lambs in maytime and then the fun there is on the scaffold the jokes the back answers the repartees and never a word to shock a baby why my little girl as goes through the marketplace every morning on her way to school you know she says to me only yesterday she says why father she says its as good as the playactors she says there again persisted robinet i object to that too they ought to show a properer feeling playing at mummers is one thing and being executed is another and people ought to keep em separate in my fathers time that sort of thing wasnt thought good taste and i dont hold with newfangled notions well really neighbour said the mayor i think youre out of sorts yourself today you must have got out of bed the wrong side this morning as for a little joke more or less we all know a maiden loves a merry jest when shes certain of having the last word but ill tell you what ill do if itll please you ill go round and see jeanne myself on my way home and tell her quite nicely you know that once in a way doesnt matter but that if she feels her health wont let her keep regular business hours she mustnt think of going on with anything thats bad for her like that dont you see and now gentlemen lets read the minutes thus it came about that jeanne took her usual walk that evening with a ruffled brow and a swelling heart and her little hand opened and shut angrily as she paced the ramparts she couldnt stand being found fault with how could she help having a headache those clods of citizens didnt know what a highly strung sensitive organisation was absorbed in her reflections she had taken several turns up and down the grassy footway before she became aware that she was not alone a youth of richer dress and more elegant bearing than the general run of the radegundians was leaning in an embrasure watching the graceful figure with evident interest something has vexed you fair maiden he observed coming forward deferentially as soon as he perceived he was noticed and care sits but awkwardly on that smooth young brow nay it is nothing kind sir replied jeanne we girls who work for our living must not be too sensitive my employers have been somewhat exigent that is all i did wrong to take it to heart tis the way of the bloated capitalist rejoined the young man lightly as he turned to walk by her side they grind us they grind us perhaps some day they will come under your hands in turn and then you can pay them out and so you toil and spin fair lily and yet methinks those delicate hands show little trace of labour you wrong me indeed sir replied jeanne merrily these hands of mine that you are so good as to admire do great execution i can well believe that your victims are numerous he replied may i be permitted to rank myself among the latest of them i wish you a better fortune kind sir answered jeanne demurely i can imagine no more delightful one he replied and where do you ply your daily task fair mistress not entirely out of sight and access i trust illustration au revoir sir if you should happen to be in the marketplace any morning nay sir laughed jeanne i work in the marketplace most mornings and there is no charge for admission and access is far from difficult indeed some complain but that is no business of mine and now i must be wishing you a goodevening nay for he would have detained her it is not seemly for an unprotected maiden to tarry in converse with a stranger at this hour au revoir sir if you should happen to be in the marketplace any morning and she tripped lightly away the youth gazing after her retreating figure confessed himself strangely fascinated by this fair unknown whose particular employment by the way he had forgotten to ask while jeanne as she sped homewards could not help reflecting that for style and distinction this new acquaintance threw into the shade all the enguerrands and others she had met hitherto even in the course of business iv the next morning was bright and breezy and jeanne was early at her post feeling quite a different girl the busy little marketplace was full of colour and movement and the gay patches of flowers and fruit the strings of fluttering kerchiefs and the piles of red and yellow pottery formed an artistic setting to the quiet impressive scaffold which they framed jeanne was in short sleeves according to the etiquette of her office and her round graceful arms showed snowily against her dark blue skirt and scarlet tightfitting bodice her assistant looked at her with admiration hope youre better miss he said respectfully it was just as well you didnt put yourself out to come yesterday there was nothing particular to do only one fellow and he said he didnt care anything to oblige a lady well i wish hed hurry up now to oblige a lady said jeanne swinging her axe carelessly to and fro ten minutes past the hour i shall have to talk to the mayor about this its a pity there aint a better show this morning pursued the assistant as he leant over the rail of the scaffold and spat meditatively into the busy throng below they do say as how the young seigneur arrived at the chteau yesterday him as has been finishing his education in paris you know hes as likely as not to be in the marketplace today and if hes disappointed he may go off to paris again which would be a pity seeing the chteaus been empty so long but he may go to paris or anywhere else hes a mind to he wont see better workmanship than in this here little town well my good raoul said jeanne colouring slightly at the obvious compliment quality not quantity is what we aim at here you know if a paris education has been properly assimilated by the seigneur he will not fail to make all the necessary allowances but see the prisondoors are opening at last illustration endeavouring to convey the tardy prisoner to the scaffold they both looked across the little square to the prison which fronted the scaffold and sure enough a small body of men the sheriff at their head was issuing from the building conveying or endeavouring to convey the tardy prisoner to the scaffold that gentleman however seemed to be in a different and less obliging frame of mind from that of the previous day and at every pace one or other of the guards was shot violently into the middle of the square propelled by a vigorous kick or blow from the struggling captive the crowd unaccustomed of late to such demonstrations of feeling and resenting the prisoners want of taste hooted loudly but it was not until that ingenious medival arrangement known as la marche aux crapauds had been brought to bear on him that the reluctant convict could be prevailed upon to present himself before the young lady he had already so unwarrantably detained jeannes profession had both accustomed her to surprises and taught her the futility of considering her clients as drawn from any one particular class yet she could hardly help feeling some astonishment on recognising her new acquaintance of the previous evening that with all his evident amiability of character he should come to this end was not in itself a special subject for wonder but that he should have been conversing with her on the ramparts at the hour when after courteously excusing her attendance on the scaffold he was cooling his heels in prison for another day seemed hardly to be accounted for at first sight jeanne however reflected that the reconciling of apparent contradictions was not included in her official duties the sheriff wiping his heated brow now read the formal procs delivering over the prisoner to the executioners hands and a nice job weve had to get him here he added on his own account and the young man who had remained perfectly tractable since his arrival stepped forward and bowed politely now that we have been properly introduced said he courteously allow me to apologise for any inconvenience you have been put to by my delay the fault was entirely mine and these gentlemen are in no way to blame had i known whom i was to have the pleasure of meeting wings could not have conveyed me swiftly enough do not mention i pray the word inconvenience replied jeanne with that timid grace which so well became her i only trust that any slight discomfort it may be my duty to cause you before we part will be as easily pardoned and now for the morning alas advances any little advice or assistance that i can offer is quite at your service for the situation is possibly new and you may have had but little experience faith none worth mentioning said the prisoner gaily treat me as a raw beginner though our acquaintance has been but brief i have the utmost confidence in you then sir said jeanne blushing suppose i were to assist you in removing this gay doublet so as to give both of us more freedom and less responsibility a perquisite of the office queried the prisoner with a smile as he slipped one arm out of its sleeve a flush came over jeannes fair brow that was ungenerous she said nay pardon me sweet one said he laughing twas but a poor jest of mine in bad taste i willingly admit illustration nay pardon me sweet one twas but a jest of mine i was sure you did not mean to hurt me she replied kindly while her fingers were busy in turning back the collar of his shirt it was composed she noticed of the finest point lace and she could not help a feeling of regret that some slight error as must from what she knew exist somewhere should compel her to take a course so at variance with her real feelings her only comfort was that the youth himself seemed entirely satisfied with his situation he hummed the last air from paris during her ministrations and when she had quite finished kissed the pretty fingers with a metropolitan grace and now sir said jeanne if you will kindly come this way and please to mind the step so now if you will have the goodness to kneel here nay the sawdust is perfectly clean you are my first client this morning on the other side of the block you will find a nick more or less adapted to the human chin though a perfect fit cannot of course be guaranteed in every case so are you pretty comfortable a bed of roses replied the prisoner and what a really admirable view one gets of the valley and the river from just this particular point charming is it not replied jeanne im so glad you do justice to it some of your predecessors have really quite vexed me by their inability to appreciate that view its worth coming here to see it and now to return to business for one moment would you prefer to give the word yourself some people do its a mere matter of taste or will you leave yourself entirely in my hands oh in your fair hands replied her client which i beg you to consider respectfully kissed once more by your faithful servant to command jeanne blushing rosily stepped back a pace moistening her palms as she grasped her axe when a puffing and blowing behind caused her to turn her head and she perceived the mayor hastily ascending the scaffold hold on a minute jeanne my girl he gasped dont be in a hurry theres been some little mistake jeanne drew herself up with dignity im afraid i dont quite understand you mr mayor she replied in freezing accents theres been no little mistake on my part that im aware of no no no said the mayor apologetically but on somebody elses there has you see it happened in this way this here young fellow was going round the town last night and hed been dining i should say and he was carrying on rather free i will only say so much in your presence that he was carrying on decidedly free so the townguard happened to come across him and he was very high and very haughty he was and wouldnt give his name nor yet his address as a gentleman should you know when hes been dining and carrying on free so our fellows just ran him in and it took the pick of them all their time to do it too well then the other chap who was in prison the gentleman who obliged you yesterday you know what does he do but slip out and run away in the middle of all the row and confusion and very inconsiderate and ungentlemanly it was of him to take advantage of us in that mean way just when we wanted a little sympathy and forbearance well the sheriff comes this morning to fetch out his man for execution and he knows theres only one man to execute and he sees theres only one man in prison and it all seems as simple as a b c he never was much of a mathematician you know so he fetches our friend here along quite gaily and and thats how it came about you see hinc ill lachrym as the roman poet has it so now i shall just give this young fellow a good talking to and discharge him with a caution and we shant require you any more today jeanne my girl now look here mr mayor said jeanne severely you utterly fail to grasp the situation in its true light all these little details may be interesting in themselves and doubtless the press will take note of them but they are entirely beside the point with the muddleheadedness of your officials which i have frequently remarked upon i have nothing whatever to do all i know is that this young gentleman has been formally handed over to me for execution with all the necessary legal requirements and executed he has got to be when my duty has been performed you are at liberty to reopen the case if you like and any little mistake that may have occurred through your stupidity you can then rectify at your leisure meantime youve no locus standi here at all in fact youve no business whatever lumbering up my scaffold so shut up and clear out now jeanne do be reasonable implored the mayor you women are so precise you never will make any allowance for the necessary margin of error in things if i were to allow the necessary margin for all your errors mayor replied jeanne coolly the edition would have to be a largepaper one and even then the text would stand a poor chance and now if you dont allow me the necessary margin to swing my axe there may be another little mistake illustration but at this point a hubbub arose at the foot of the scaffold but at this point a hubbub arose at the foot of the scaffold and jeanne leaning over perceived sundry tall fellows clad in the livery of the seigneur engaged in dispersing the municipal guard by the agency of welldirected kicks applied with heartiness and anatomical knowledge a moment later there strode on to the scaffold clad in black velvet and adorned with his gold chain of office the stately old seneschal of the chteau evidently in a towering passion now mark my words you miserable little bladderolard he roared at the mayor whose bald head certainly shone provokingly in the morning sun see if i dont take this out of your skin presently and he passed on to where the youth was still kneeling apparently quite absorbed in the view my lord he said firmly though respectfully your hairbrained folly really passes all bounds have you entirely lost your head faith nearly said the young man rising and stretching himself is that you old thibault ow what a crick ive got in my neck but that view of the valley was really delightful did you come here simply to admire the view my lord inquired thibault severely illustration now mark my words you miserable little bladderolard see if i dont take this out of your skin presently i came because my horse would come replied the young seigneur lightly that is these gentlemen here were so pressing they would not hear of any refusal and besides they forgot to mention what my attendance was required in such a hurry for and when i got here thibault old fellow and saw that divine creature nay a goddess dea cert so graceful so modest so anxious to acquit herself with credit well you know my weakness i never could bear to disappoint a woman she had evidently set her heart on taking my head and as she had my heart already i think my lord said thibault with some severity you had better let me escort you back to the chteau this appears to be hardly a safe place for lightheaded and susceptible persons jeanne as was natural had the last word understand me mr mayor said she these proceedings are entirely irregular i decline to recognise them and when the quarter expires i shall claim the usual bonus v when an hour or two later an invitation arrived courteously worded but significantly backed by an escort of halfadozen tall archers for both jeanne and the mayor to attend at the chteau without delay jeanne for her part received it with neither surprise nor reluctance she had felt it especially hard that the only two interviews fate had granted her with the one man who had made some impression on her heart should be hampered the one by considerations of propriety the other by the conflicting claims of her profession and its duties on this occasion now she would have an excellent chaperon in the mayor and business being over for the day they could meet and unbend on a common social footing the mayor was not at all surprised either considering what had gone before but he was exceedingly terrified and sought some consolation from jeanne as they proceeded together to the chteau that young ladys remarks however could hardly be called exactly comforting illustration an invitation arrived backed by an escort of halfadozen tall archers i always thought youd put your foot in it some day mayor she said you are so hopelessly wanting in system and method really under the present happygolucky police arrangements i never know whom i may not be called upon to execute between you and my cousin enguerrand life is hardly safe in this town and the worst of it is that we other officials on the staff have to share in the discredit what do you think theyll do to me jeanne whimpered the mayor perspiring freely cant say im sure pursued the candid jeanne of course if its anything in the rack line of business i shall have to superintend the arrangements and then you can feel sure youre in capable hands but probably theyll only fine you pretty smartly give you a month or two in the dungeons and dismiss you from your post and you will hardly grudge any slight personal inconvenience resulting from an arrangement so much to the advantage of the town this was hardly reassuring but the mayors official reprimand of the previous day still rankled in this unforgiving young persons mind on their reaching the chteau the mayor was conducted aside to be dealt with by thibault and from the sounds of agonised protestation and lament which shortly reached jeannes ears it was evident that he was having a mauvais quart dheure the young lady was shown respectfully into a chamber apart where she had hardly had time to admire sufficiently the good taste of the furniture and the magnificence of the tapestry with which the walls were hung when the seigneur entered and welcomed her with a cordial grace that put her entirely at her ease your punctuality puts me to shame fair mistress he said considering how unwarrantably i kept you waiting this morning and how i tested your patience by my ignorance and awkwardness he had changed his dress and the lace round his neck was even richer than before jeanne had always considered one of the chief marks of a wellbred man to be a fine disregard for the amount of his washingbill and then with what good taste he referred to recent events putting himself in the wrong as a gentleman should indeed my lord she replied modestly i was only too anxious to hear from your own lips that you bore me no illwill for the part forced on me by circumstances in our recent interview your lordship has sufficient critical good sense i feel sure to distinguish between the woman and the official true jeanne he replied drawing nearer and while i shrink from expressing in their fulness all the feelings that the woman inspires in me i have no hesitation for i know it will give you pleasure in acquainting you with the entire artistic satisfaction with which i watched you at your task but indeed said jeanne you did not see me at my best in fact i cant help wishing its ridiculous i know because the thing is hardly practicable but if i could only have carried my performance quite through and put the last finishing touches to it you would not have been judging me now by the mere blockingin of what promised to be a masterpiece yes i wish it could have been arranged somehow said the seigneur reflectively but perhaps its better as it is i am content to let the artist remain for the present on trust if i may only take over fully paid up the woman i adore jeanne felt strangely weak the official seemed oozing out at her fingers and toes while the womans heart beat even more distressingly i have one little question to ask he murmured his arm was about her now do i understand that you still claim your bonus jeanne felt like water in his strong embrace but she nerved herself to answer faintly but firmly yes then so do i he replied as his lips met hers executions continued to occur in st radegonde the radegundians being conservative and very human but much of the innocent enjoyment that formerly attended them departed after the fair chtelaine had ceased to officiate enguerrand on succeeding to the post wedded clairette she being he was heard to say a more suitable match in mind and temper than others of whom he would name no names rumour had it that he found his match and something over while as for temper and mind which she gave him in bits but the domestic trials of highplaced officials have a right to be held sacred the profession in spite of his best endeavours languished nevertheless some said that the scaffold lacked its old attraction for criminals of spirit others more unkindly that the headsman was the innocent cause and that enguerrand was less fatal in his new sphere than formerly when practising in the criminal court as advocate for the defence illustration the end
