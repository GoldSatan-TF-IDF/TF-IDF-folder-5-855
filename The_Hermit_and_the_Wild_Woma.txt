edith wharton new york mcmviii table of contents i the hermit and the wild woman ii the last asset iii in trust iv the pretext v the verdict vi the potboiler vii the best man the hermit and the wild woman i the hermit lived in a cave in the hollow of a hill below him was a glen with a stream in a coppice of oaks and alders and on the farther side of the valley half a days journey distant another hill steep and bristling which raised aloft a little walled town with ghibelline swallowtails notched against the sky when the hermit was a lad and lived in the town the crenellations of the walls had been squaretopped and a guelf lord had flown his standard from the keep then one day a steelcoloured line of menatarms rode across the valley wound up the hill and battered in the gates stones and greek fire rained from the ramparts shields clashed in the streets blade sprang at blade in passages and stairways pikes and lances dripped above huddled flesh and all the still familiar place was a stew of dying bodies the boy fled from it in horror he had seen his father go forth and not come back his mother drop dead from an arquebuse shot as she leaned from the platform of the tower his little sister fall with a slit throat across the altar steps of the chapel and he ran ran for his life through the slippery streets over warm twitching bodies between legs of soldiers carousing out of the gates past burning farmsteads trampled wheatfields orchards stripped and broken till the still woods received him and he fell face down on the unmutilated earth he had no wish to go back his longing was to live hidden from life up the hillside he found a hollow in the rock and built before it a porch of boughs bound together with withies he fed on nuts and roots and on trout which he caught with his hands under the stones in the stream he had always been a quiet boy liking to sit at his mothers feet and watch the flowers grow on her embroidery frame while the chaplain read aloud the histories of the desert fathers from a great silverclasped volume he would rather have been bred a clerk and scholar than a knights son and his happiest moments were when he served mass for the chaplain in the early morning and felt his heart flutter up and up like a lark up and up till it was lost in infinite space and brightness almost as happy were the hours when he sat beside the foreign painter who came over the mountains to paint the chapel and under whose brush celestial faces grew out of the rough wall as if he had sown some magic seed which flowered while you watched it with the appearing of every goldrimmed face the boy felt he had won another friend a friend who would come and bend above him at night keeping off the ugly visions which haunted his pillow visions of the gnawing monsters about the churchporch evilfaced bats and dragons giant worms and winged bristling hogs a devils flock who crept down from the stonework at night and hunted the souls of sinful children through the town with the growth of the picture the bright mailed angels thronged so close about the boys bed that between their interwoven wings not a snout or a claw could force itself and he would turn over sighing on his pillow which felt as soft and warm as if it had been lined with down from those sheltering pinions all these thoughts came back to him now in his cave on the cliffside the stillness seemed to enclose him with wings to fold him away from life and evil he was never restless or discontented he loved the long silent empty days each one as like the other as pearls in a wellmatched string above all he liked to have time to save his soul he had been greatly troubled about his soul since a band of flagellants had passed through the town exhibiting their gaunt scourged bodies and exhorting the people to turn from soft raiment and delicate fare from marriage and moneygetting and dancing and games and think only how they might escape the devils talons and the great red blaze of hell for days that red blaze hung on the edge of the boys thoughts like the light of a burning city across a plain there seemed to be so many pitfalls to avoid so many things were wicked which one might have supposed to be harmless how could a child of his age tell he dared not for a moment think of anything else and the scene of sack and slaughter from which he had fled gave shape and distinctness to that bloodred vision hell was like that only a million million times worse now he knew how flesh looked when devils pincers tore it how the shrieks of the damned sounded and how roasting bodies smelled how could a christian spare one moment of his days and nights from the long long struggle to keep safe from the wrath to come gradually the horror faded leaving only a tranquil pleasure in the minute performance of his religious duties his mind was not naturally given to the contemplation of evil and in the blessed solitude of his new life his thoughts dwelt more and more on the beauty of holiness his desire was to be perfectly good and to live in love and charity with his fellowmen and how could one do this without fleeing from them at first his life was difficult for in the winter season he was put to great straits to feed himself and there were nights when the sky was like an iron vault and a hoarse wind rattled the oakwood in the valley and a great fear came on him that was worse than any cold but in time it became known to his townsfolk and to the peasants in the neighbouring valleys that he had withdrawn to the wilderness to lead a godly life and after that his worst hardships were over for pious persons brought him gifts of oil and dried fruit one good woman gave him seeds from her garden another spun for him a hodden gown and others would have brought him all manner of food and clothing had he not refused to accept anything but for his bare needs the good woman who had given him the seeds showed him also how to build a little garden on the southern ledge of his cliff and all one summer the hermit carried up soil from the streamside and the next he carried up water to keep his garden green after that the fear of solitude quite passed from him for he was so busy all day long that at night he had much ado to fight off the demon of sleep which saint arsenius the abbot has denounced as the chief foe of the solitary his memory kept good store of prayers and litanies besides long passages from the mass and other offices and he marked the hours of his day by different acts of devotion on sundays and feast days when the wind was set his way he could hear the church bells from his native town and these helped him to follow the worship of the faithful and to bear in mind the seasons of the liturgical year and what with carrying up water from the river digging in the garden gathering fagots for his fire observing his religious duties and keeping his thoughts continually upon the salvation of his soul the hermit knew not a moments idleness at first during his night vigils he had felt a great fear of the stars which seemed to set a cruel watch upon him as though they spied out the frailty of his heart and took the measure of his littleness but one day a wandering clerk to whom he chanced to give a nights shelter explained to him that in the opinion of the most learned doctors of theology the stars were inhabited by the spirits of the blessed and this thought brought great consolation to the hermit even on winter nights when the eagles wings clanged among the peaks and he heard the long howl of wolves about the sheepcotes in the valley he no longer felt any fear but thought of those sounds as representing the evil voices of the world and hugged himself in the solitude of his cave sometimes to keep himself awake he composed lauds in honour of christ and the saints and they seemed to him so pleasant that he feared to forget them so after much debate with himself he decided to ask a friendly priest from the valley who sometimes visited him to write down the lauds and the priest wrote them down on comely sheepskin which the hermit dried and prepared with his own hands when the hermit saw them written down they appeared to him so beautiful that he feared to commit the sin of vanity if he looked at them too often so he hid them between two smooth stones in his cave and vowed that he would take them out only once in the year at easter when our lord has risen and it is meet that christians should rejoice and this vow he faithfully kept but alas when easter drew near he found he was looking forward to the blessed festival less because of our lords rising than because he should then be able to read his pleasant lauds written on fair sheepskin and thereupon he took a vow that he would not look upon the lauds till he lay dying so the hermit for many years lived to the glory of god and in great peace of mind ii one day he resolved to set forth on a visit to the saint of the rock who lived on the other side of the mountains travellers had brought the hermit report of this solitary how he lived in great holiness and austerity in a desert place among the hills where snow lay all winter and in summer the sun beat down cruelly the saint it appeared had vowed that he would withdraw from the world to a spot where there was neither shade nor water lest he should be tempted to take his ease and think less continually upon his maker but wherever he went he found a spreading tree or a gushing spring till at last he climbed up to the bare heights where nothing grows and where the only water comes from the melting of the snow in spring here he found a tall rock rising from the ground and in it he scooped a hollow with his own hands labouring for five years and wearing his fingers to the bone then he seated himself in the hollow which faced the west so that in winter he should have small warmth of the sun and in summer be consumed by it and there he had sat without moving for years beyond number the hermit was greatly drawn by the tale of such austerities which in his humility he did not dream of emulating but desired for his souls good to contemplate and praise so one day he bound sandals to his feet cut an alder staff from the stream and set out to visit the saint of the rock it was the pleasant spring season when seeds are shooting and the bud is on the tree the hermit was troubled at the thought of leaving his plants without water but he could not travel in winter by reason of the snows and in summer he feared the garden would suffer even more from his absence so he set out praying that rain might fall while he was away and hoping to return again in five days the peasants labouring in the fields left their work to ask his blessing and they would even have followed him in great numbers had he not told them that he was bound on a pilgrimage to the saint of the rock and that it behoved him to go alone as one solitary seeking another so they respected his wish and he went on and entered the forest in the forest he walked for two days and slept for two nights he heard the wolves crying and foxes rustling in the covert and once at twilight a shaggy brown man peered at him through the leaves and galloped away with a soft padding of hoofs but the hermit feared neither wild beasts nor evildoers nor even the fauns and satyrs who linger in unhallowed forest depths where the cross has not been raised for he said if i die i die to the glory of god and if i live it must be to the same end only he felt a secret pang at the thought that he might die without seeing his lauds again but the third day without misadventure he came out on another valley then he began to climb the mountain first through brown woods of beech and oak then through pine and broom and then across red stony ledges where only a pinched growth of lentisk and briar spread in patches over the rock by this time he thought to have reached his goal but for two more days he fared on through the same scene with the sky close over him and the green valleys of earth receding far below sometimes for hours he saw only the red glistering slopes tufted with thin bushes and the hard blue heaven so close that it seemed his hand could touch it then at a turn of the path the rocks rolled apart the eye plunged down a long pineclad defile and beyond it the forest flowed in mighty undulations to a plain shining with cities and another mountainrange many days journey away to some eyes this would have been a terrible spectacle reminding the wayfarer of his remoteness from his kind and of the perils which lurk in waste places and the weakness of man against them but the hermit was so mated to solitude and felt such love for all things created that to him the bare rocks sang of their maker and the vast distance bore witness to his greatness so his servant journeyed on unafraid but one morning after a long climb over steep and difficult slopes the wayfarer halted suddenly at a bend of the way for beyond the defile at his feet there was no plain shining with cities but a bare expanse of shaken silver that reached away to the rim of the world and the hermit knew it was the sea fear seized him then for it was terrible to see that great plain move like a heaving bosom and as he looked on it the earth seemed also to heave beneath him but presently he remembered how christ had walked the waves and how even saint mary of egypt who was a great sinner had crossed the waters of jordan dryshod to receive the sacrament from the abbot zosimus and then the hermits heart grew still and he sang as he went down the mountain the sea shall praise thee o lord all day he kept seeing it and then losing it but toward night he came to a cleft of the hills and lay down in a pinewood to sleep he had now been six days gone and once and again he thought anxiously of his herbs but he said to himself what though my garden perish if i see a holy man face to face and praise god in his company so he was never long cast down before daylight he was afoot under the stars and leaving the wood where he had slept began climbing the face of a tall cliff where he had to clutch the jutting ledges with his hands and with every step he gained a rock seemed thrust forth to hurl him back so footsore and bleeding he reached a little stony plain as the sun dropped to the sea and in the red light he saw a hollow rock and the saint sitting in the hollow the hermit fell on his knees praising god then he rose and ran across the plain to the rock as he drew near he saw that the saint was a very old man clad in goatskin with a long white beard he sat motionless his hands on his knees and two red eyesockets turned to the sunset near him was a young boy in skins who brushed the flies from his face but they always came back and settled on the rheum which ran from his eyes he did not appear to hear or see the approach of the hermit but sat quite still till the boy said father here is a pilgrim then he lifted up his voice and asked angrily who was there and what the stranger sought the hermit answered father the report of your holy practices came to me a long way off and being myself a solitary though not worthy to be named with you for godliness it seemed fitting that i should cross the mountains to visit you that we might sit together and speak in praise of solitude the saint replied you fool how can two sit together and praise solitude since by so doing they put an end to the thing they pretend to honour the hermit at that was sorely abashed for he had thought his speech out on the way reciting it many times over and now it appeared to him vainer than the crackling of thorns under a pot nevertheless he took heart and said true father but may not two sinners sit together and praise christ who has taught them the blessings of solitude but the other only answered if you had really learned the blessings of solitude you would not squander them in idle wandering and the hermit not knowing how to reply he said again if two sinners meet they can best praise christ by going each his own way in silence after that he shut his lips and continued motionless while the boy brushed the flies from his eyesockets but the hermits heart sank and for the first time he felt all the weariness of the way he had fared and the great distance dividing him from home he had meant to take counsel with the saint concerning his lauds and whether he ought to destroy them but now he had no heart to say another word and turning away he began to descend the mountain presently he heard steps running behind him and the boy came up and pressed a honeycomb in his hand you have come a long way and must be hungry he said but before the hermit could thank him he had hastened back to his task so the hermit crept down the mountain till he reached the wood where he had slept before and there he made his bed again but he had no mind to eat before sleeping for his heart hungered more than his body and his salt tears made the honeycomb bitter iii on the fourteenth day he came to the valley below his cliff and saw the walls of his native town against the sky he was footsore and heavy of heart for his long pilgrimage had brought him only weariness and humiliation and as no drop of rain had fallen he knew that his garden must have perished so he climbed the cliff heavily and reached his cave at the angelus but there a great wonder awaited him for though the scant earth of the hillside was parched and crumbling his gardensoil reeked with moisture and his plants had shot up fresh and glistening to a height they had never before attained more wonderful still the tendrils of the gourd had been trained about his door and kneeling down he saw that the earth had been loosened between the rows of sprouting vegetables and that every leaf sparkled with drops as though the rain had but newly ceased then it appeared to the hermit that he beheld a miracle but doubting his own deserts he refused to believe himself worthy of such grace and went within doors to ponder on what had befallen him and on his bed of rushes he saw a young woman sleeping clad in an outlandish garment with strange amulets about her neck the sight was very terrifying to the hermit for he recalled how often the demon in tempting the desert fathers had taken the form of a woman for their undoing but he reflected that since there was nothing pleasing to him in the sight of this female who was brown as a nut and lean with wayfaring he ran no great danger in looking at her at first he took her for a wandering egyptian but as he looked he perceived among the heathen charms an agnus dei in her bosom and this so surprised him that he bent over and called on her to wake she sprang up with a start but seeing the hermits gown and staff and his face above her lay quiet and said to him i have watered your garden daily in return for the beans and oil that i took from your store who are you and how do you come here asked the hermit she said i am a wild woman and live in the woods and when he pressed her again to tell him why she had sought shelter in his cave she said that the land to the south whence she came was full of armed companies and bands of marauders and that great license and bloodshed prevailed there and this the hermit knew to be true for he had heard of it on his homeward journey the wild woman went on to tell him that she had been hunted through the woods like an animal by a band of drunken menatarms lansknechts from the north by their barbarous dress and speech and at length starving and spent had come on his cave and hidden herself from her pursuers for she said i fear neither wild beasts nor the woodland people charcoal burners egyptians wandering minstrels or chapmen even the highway robbers do not touch me because i am poor and brown but these armed men flown with blood and wine are more terrible than wolves and tigers and the hermits heart melted for he thought of his little sister lying with her throat slit across the altar steps and of the scenes of blood and rapine from which he had fled away into the wilderness so he said to the stranger that it was not meet he should house her in his cave but that he would send a messenger to the town across the valley and beg a pious woman there to give her lodging and work in her household for said he i perceive by the blessed image about your neck that you are not a heathen wilding but a child of christ though so far astray from him in the desert yes she said i am a christian and know as many prayers as you but i will never set foot in city walls again lest i be caught and put back into the convent what cried the hermit with a start you are a runagate nun and he crossed himself and again thought of the demon she smiled and said it is true i was once a cloistered woman but i will never willingly be one again now drive me forth if you like but i cannot go far for i have a wounded foot which i got in climbing the cliff with water for your garden and she pointed to a deep cut in her foot at that for all his fear the hermit was moved to pity and washed the cut and bound it up and as he did so he bethought him that perhaps his strange visitor had been sent to him not for his souls undoing but for her own salvation and from that hour he earnestly yearned to save her but it was not fitting that she should remain in his cave so having given her water to drink and a handful of lentils he raised her up and putting his staff in her hand guided her to a hollow not far off in the face of the cliff and while he was doing this he heard the sunset bells ring across the valley and set about reciting the angelus domini nuntiavit mariae and she joined in very piously with her hands folded not missing a word nevertheless the thought of her wickedness weighed on him and the next day when he went to carry her food he asked her to tell him how it came about that she had fallen into such abominable sin and this is the story she told iv i was born said she in the north country where the winters are long and cold where snow sometimes falls in the valleys and the high mountains for months are white with it my fathers castle is in a tall green wood where the winds always rustle and a cold river runs down from the icegorges south of us was the wide plain glowing with heat but above us were stony passes where the eagle nests and the storms howl in winter great fires roared in our chimneys and even in summer there was always a cool air off the gorges but when i was a child my mother went southward in the great empresss train and i went with her we travelled many days across plains and mountains and saw rome where the pope lives in a golden palace and many other cities till we came to the great emperors court there for two years or more we lived in pomp and merriment for it was a wonderful court full of mimes magicians philosophers and poets and the empresss ladies spent their days in mirth and music dressed in light silken garments walking in gardens of roses and bathing in a great cool marble tank while the emperors eunuchs guarded the approach to the gardens oh those baths in the marble tank my father i used to lie awake through the whole hot southern night and think of that plunge at sunrise under the last stars for we were in a burning country and i pined for the tall green woods and the cold stream of my fathers valley and when i had cooled my limbs in the tank i lay all day in the scant cypress shade and dreamed of my next bath my mother pined for the coolness till she died then the empress put me in a convent and i was forgotten the convent was on the side of a bare yellow hill where bees made a hot buzzing in the thyme below was the sea blazing with a million shafts of light and overhead a blinding sky which reflected the suns glitter like a huge baldric of steel now the convent was built on the site of an old pleasurehouse which a holy princess had given to our order and a part of the house was left standing with its court and garden the nuns had built all about the garden but they left the cypresses in the middle and the long marble tank where the princess and her ladies had bathed the tank however as you may conceive was no longer used as a bath for the washing of the body is an indulgence forbidden to cloistered virgins and our abbess who was famed for her austerities boasted that like holy sylvia the nun she never touched water save to bathe her fingertips before receiving the sacrament with such an example before them the nuns were obliged to conform to the same pious rule and many having been bred in the convent from infancy regarded all ablutions with horror and felt no temptation to cleanse the filth from their flesh but i who had bathed daily had the freshness of clear water in my veins and perished slowly for want of it like your garden herbs in a drought my cell did not look on the garden but on the steep mulepath leading up the cliff where all day long the sun beat as if with flails of fire and i saw the sweating peasants toil up and down behind their thirsty asses and the beggars whining and scraping their sores in the heat oh how i hated to look out through the bars on that burning world i used to turn away from it sick with disgust and lying on my hard bed stare up by the hour at the ceiling of my cell but flies crawled in hundreds on the ceiling and the hot noise they made was worse than the glare sometimes at an hour when i knew myself unobserved i tore off my stifling gown and hung it over the grated window that i might no longer see the shaft of hot sunlight lying across my cell and the dust dancing in it like fat in the fire but the darkness choked me and i struggled for breath as though i lay at the bottom of a pit so that at last i would spring up and dragging down the dress fling myself on my knees before the cross and entreat our lord to give me the gift of holiness that i might escape the everlasting fires of hell of which this heat was like an awful foretaste for if i could not endure the scorching of a summers day with what constancy could i meet the thought of the flame that dieth not this longing to escape the heat of hell made me apply myself to a devouter way of living and i reflected that if my bodily distress were somewhat eased i should be able to throw myself with greater zeal into the practice of vigils and austerities and at length having set forth to the abbess that the sultry air of my cell induced in me a grievous heaviness of sleep i prevailed on her to lodge me in that part of the building which overlooked the garden for a few days i was quite happy for instead of the dusty mountainside and the sight of the sweating peasants and their asses i looked out on dark cypresses and rows of budding vegetables but presently i found i had not bettered myself for with the approach of midsummer the garden being all enclosed with buildings grew as stifling as my cell all the green things in it withered and dried off leaving trenches of bare red earth across which the cypresses cast strips of shade too narrow to cool the aching heads of the nuns who sought shelter there and i began to think sorrowfully of my former cell where now and then there came a seabreeze hot and languid yet alive and where at least i could look out upon the sea but this was not the worst for when the dogdays came i found that the sun at a certain hour cast on the ceiling of my cell the reflection of the ripples on the gardentank and to say how i suffered from this sight is not within the power of speech it was indeed agony to watch the clear water rippling and washing above my head yet feel no solace of it on my limbs as though i had been a senseless brazen image lying at the bottom of a well but the image if it felt no refreshment would have suffered no torture whereas every inch of my skin throbbed with thirst and every vein was a mouth of dives praying for a drop of water oh father how shall i tell you the grievous pains that i endured sometimes i so feared the sight of the mocking ripples overhead that i hid my eyes from their approach lying face down on my burning bed till i knew that they were gone yet on cloudy days when they did not come the heat was even worse to bear by day i hardly dared trust myself in the garden for the nuns walked there and one fiery noon they found me hanging so close above the tank that they snatched me away crying out that i had tried to destroy myself the scandal of this reaching the abbess she sent for me to know what demon had beset me and when i wept and said the longing to bathe my burning body she broke into great anger and cried out do you not know that this is a sin wellnigh as great as the other and condemned by all the greatest saints for a nun may be tempted to take her life through excess of selfscrutiny and despair of her own worthiness but this desire to indulge the despicable body is one of the lusts of the flesh to be classed with concupiscence and adultery and she ordered me to sleep every night for a month in my heavy gown with a veil upon my face now father i believe it was this penance that drove me to sin for we were in the dogdays and it was more than flesh could bear and on the third night after the portress had passed and the lights were out i rose and flung off my veil and gown and knelt in my window fainting there was no moon but the sky was full of stars at first the garden was all blackness but as i looked i saw a faint twinkle between the cypresstrunks and i knew it was the starlight on the tank the water the water it was there close to me only a few bolts and bars were between us the portress was a heavy sleeper and i knew where her keys hung on a nail just within the door of her cell i stole thither unlatched the door seized the keys and crept barefoot down the corridor the bolts of the cloisterdoor were stiff and heavy and i dragged at them till the veins in my wrists were bursting then i turned the key and it cried out in the ward i stood still my whole body beating with fear lest the hinges too should have a voice but no one stirred and i pushed open the door and slipped out the garden was as airless as a pit but at least i could stretch my arms in it and oh my father the sweetness of the stars the stones in the path cut my feet as i ran but i thought of the joy of bathing them in the tank and that made the wounds sweet to me my father i have heard of the temptations which in times past assailed the holy solitaries of the desert flattering the reluctant flesh beyond resistance but none i think could have surpassed in ecstasy that first touch of the water on my limbs to prolong the joy i let myself slip in slowly resting my hands on the edge of the tank and smiling to see my body as i lowered it break up the shining black surface and shatter the starbeams into splinters and the water my father seemed to crave me as i craved it its ripples rose about me first in furtive touches then in a long embrace that clung and drew me down till at length they lay like kisses on my lips it was no frank comrade like the mountain pools of my childhood but a secret playmate compassionating my pains and soothing them with noiseless hands from the first i thought of it as an accomplice its whisper seemed to promise me secrecy if i would promise it love and i went back and back to it my father all day i lived in the thought of it each night i stole to it with fresh thirst but at length the old portress died and a young laysister took her place she was a light sleeper and keeneared and i knew the danger of venturing to her cell i knew the danger but when darkness came i felt the water drawing me the first night i fought on my bed and held out but the second i crept to her door she made no motion when i entered but rose up secretly and stole after me and the second night she warned the abbess and the two came on me as i stood by the tank i was punished with terrible penances fasting scourging imprisonment and the privation of drinking water for the abbess stood amazed at the obduracy of my sin and was resolved to make me an example to my fellows for a month i endured the pains of hell then one night the saracen pirates fell on our convent on a sudden the darkness was full of flames and blood but while the other nuns ran hither and thither clinging to the abbesss feet or shrieking on the steps of the altar i slipped through an unwatched postern and made my way to the hills the next day the emperors soldiery descended on the carousing heathen slew them and burned their vessels on the beach the abbess and nuns were rescued the convent walls rebuilt and peace restored to the holy precincts all this i heard from a shepherdess of the hills who found me in my hiding and brought me honeycomb and water in her simplicity she offered to lead me home to the convent but while she slept i laid off my wimple and scapular and stealing her cloak fled away lest she should betray me and since then i have wandered alone over the face of the world living in woods and desert places often hungry often cold and sometimes fearful yet resigned to any hardship and with a front for any peril if only i may sleep under the free heaven and wash the dust from my body in cool water v the hermit as may be supposed was much perturbed by this story and dismayed that such sinfulness should cross his path his first motion was to drive the woman forth for he knew the heinousness of the craving for water and how saint jerome saint augustine and other holy doctors have taught that they who would purify the soul must not be distraught by the vain cares of bodily cleanliness yet remembering the lust that drew him to his lauds he dared not judge his sisters fault too harshly moreover he was moved by the wild womans story of the hardships she had suffered and the godless company she had been driven to keep egyptians jugglers outlaws and even sorcerers who are masters of the pagan lore of the east and still practice their dark rites among the simple folk of the hills yet she would not have him think wholly ill of this vagrant people from whom she had often received food and comfort and her worst danger as he learned with shame had come from the girovaghi or wandering monks who are the scourge and dishonour of christendom carrying their ribald idleness from one monastery to another and leaving on their way a trail of thieving revelry and worse once or twice the wild woman had nearly fallen into their hands but had been saved by her own quick wit and skill in woodcraft once so she assured the hermit she had found refuge with a faun and his female who fed and sheltered her in their cave where she slept on a bed of leaves with their shaggy nurslings and in this cave she had seen a stock or idol of wood extremely seamed and ancient before which the woodcreatures when they thought she slept laid garlands and the wild bees honeycomb she told him also of a hillvillage of weavers where she lived many weeks and learned to ply their trade in return for her lodging and where wayfaring men in the guise of cobblers charcoalburners or goatherds came and taught strange doctrines at midnight in the poor hovels what they taught she could not clearly tell save that they believed each soul could commune directly with its maker without need of priest or intercessor also she had heard from some of their disciples that there are two gods one of good and one of evil and that the god of evil has his throne in the popes palace in rome but in spite of these dark teachings they were a mild and merciful folk full of lovingkindness toward poor persons and wayfarers so that her heart grieved for them when one day a dominican monk appeared in the village with a company of soldiers and some of the weavers were seized and dragged to prison while others with their wives and babes fled to the winter woods she fled with them fearing to be charged with their heresy and for months they lay hid in desert places the older and weaker who fell sick from want and exposure being devoutly ministered to by their brethren and dying in the sure faith of heaven all this she related modestly and simply not as one who joys in a godless life but as having been drawn into it through misadventure and she told the hermit that when she heard the sound of church bells she never failed to say an ave or a pater and that often as she lay in the midnight darkness of the forest she had hushed her fears by reciting the versicles from the evening hour keep us o lord as the apple of the eye protect us under the shadow of thy wings the wound in her foot healed slowly and the hermit while it was mending repaired daily to her cave reasoning with her in love and charity and exhorting her to return to the cloister but this she persistently refused to do and fearing lest she attempt to fly before her foot was healed and so expose herself to hunger and illusage he promised not to betray her presence or to take any measures toward restoring her to her order he began indeed to doubt whether she had any calling to the life enclosed yet her gentleness and innocency of mind made him feel that she might be won back to holy living if only her freedom were assured so after many inward struggles since his promise forbade his taking counsel with any concerning her he resolved to let her remain in the cave till some light should come to him and one day visiting her about the hour of nones for it became his pious habit to say the evening office with her he found her engaged with a little goatherd who in a sudden seizure had fallen from a rock above her cave and lay senseless and full of blood at her feet and the hermit saw with wonder how skilfully she bound up his cuts and restored his senses giving him to drink of a liquor she had distilled from the wild simples of the mountain whereat the boy opened his eyes and praised god as one restored by heaven now it was known that this lad was subject to possessions and had more than once dropped lifeless while he heeded his flock and the hermit knowing that only great saints or unclean necromancers can loosen devils feared that the wild woman had exorcised the spirits by means of unholy spells but she told him that the goatherds sickness was caused only by the heat of the sun and that such seizures being common in the hot countries whence she came she had learned from a wise woman how to stay them by a decoction of the carduus benedictus made in the third night of the waxing moon but without the aid of magic but she continued you need not fear my bringing scandal on your holy retreat for by the arts of the same wise woman my own wound is wellnigh healed and tonight at sunset i set forth on my travels the hermits heart grew heavy as she spoke and it seemed to him that her own look was sorrowful and suddenly his perplexities were lifted from him and he saw what was gods purpose with the wild woman why said he do you fly from this place where you are safe from molestation and can look to the saving of your soul is it that your feet weary for the road and your spirits are heavy for lack of worldly discourse she replied that she had no wish to travel and felt no repugnance to solitude but said she i must go forth to beg my bread since in this wilderness there is none but yourself to feed me and moreover when it is known that i have healed the goatherd curious folk and scandalmongers may seek me out and learning whence i come drag me back to the cloister then the hermit answered her and said in the early days when the faith of christ was first preached there were holy women who fled to the desert and lived there in solitude to the glory of god and the edification of their sex if you are minded to embrace so austere a life contenting you with such sustenance as the wilderness yields and wearing out your days in prayer and vigil it may be that you shall make amends for the great sin you have committed and live and die in the peace of the lord jesus he spoke thus knowing that if she left him and returned to her roaming hunger and fear might drive her to fresh sin whereas in a life of penance and reclusion her eyes might be opened to her iniquity and her soul snatched back from ruin he saw that his words moved her and she seemed about to consent and embrace a life of holiness but suddenly she fell silent and looked down on the valley at their feet a stream flows in the glen below us she said do you forbid me to bathe in it in the heat of summer it is not i that forbid you my daughter but the laws of god said the hermit yet see how miraculously heaven protects you for in the hot season when your lust is upon you our stream runs dry and temptation will be removed from you moreover on these heights there is no excess of heat to madden the body but always before dawn and at the angelus a cool breeze which refreshes it like water and after thinking long on this and again receiving his promise not to betray her the wild woman agreed to embrace a life of reclusion and the hermit fell on his knees worshipping god and rejoicing to think that if he saved his sister from sin his own term of probation would be shortened vi thereafter for two years the hermit and the wild woman lived side by side meeting together to pray on the great feastdays of the year but on all other days dwelling apart engaged in pious practices at first the hermit knowing the weakness of woman and her little aptitude for the life apart had feared that he might be disturbed by the nearness of his penitent but she faithfully held to his commands abstaining from all sight of him save on the days of obligation and when they met so modest and devout was her demeanour that she raised his soul to fresh fervency and gradually it grew sweet to him to think that near by though unseen was one who performed the same tasks at the same hours so that whether he tended his garden or recited his chaplet or rose under the stars to repeat the midnight office he had a companion in all his labours and devotions meanwhile the report had spread abroad that a holy woman who cast out devils had made her dwelling in the hermits cliff and many sick persons from the valley sought her out and went away restored by her these poor pilgrims brought her oil and flour and with her own hands she made a garden like the hermits and planted it with corn and lentils but she would never take a trout from the brook or receive the gift of a snared wildfowl for she said that in her vagrant life the wild creatures of the wood had befriended her and as she had slept in peace among them so now she would never suffer them to be molested in the third year came a plague and death walked the cities and many poor peasants fled to the hills to escape it these the hermit and his penitent faithfully tended and so skilful were the wild womans ministrations that the report of them reached the town across the valley and a deputation of burgesses came with rich offerings and besought her to descend and comfort their sick the hermit seeing her depart on so dangerous a mission would have accompanied her but she bade him remain and tend those who fled to the hills and for many days his heart was consumed in prayer for her and he feared lest every fugitive should bring him word of her death but at length she returned weariedout but whole and covered with the blessings of the townsfolk and thereafter her name for holiness spread as wide as the hermits seeing how constant she remained in her chosen life and what advance she had made in the way of perfection the hermit now felt that it behoved him to exhort her again to return to the convent and more than once he resolved to speak with her but his heart hung back at length he bethought him that by failing in this duty he imperilled his own soul and thereupon on the next feastday when they met he reminded her that in spite of her good works she still lived in sin and excommunicate and that now she had once more tasted the sweets of godliness it was her duty to confess her fault and give herself up to her superiors she heard him meekly but when he had spoken she was silent and her tears ran over and looking at her he wept also and said no more and they prayed together and returned each to his cave it was not till late winter that the plague abated and the spring and early summer following were heavy with rains and great heat when the hermit visited his penitent at the feast of pentecost she appeared to him so weak and wasted that when they had recited the veni sancte spiritus and the proper psalms he taxed her with too great rigour of penitential practices but she replied that her weakness was not due to an excess of discipline but that she had brought back from her labours among the sick a heaviness of body which the intemperance of the season no doubt increased the evil rains continued falling chiefly at night while by day the land reeked with heat and vapours so that lassitude fell on the hermit also and he could hardly drag himself down to the spring whence he drew his drinkingwater thus he fell into the habit of going down to the glen before cockcrow after he had recited matins for at that hour the rain commonly ceased and a faint air was stirring now because of the wet season the stream had not gone dry and instead of replenishing his flagon slowly at the trickling spring the hermit went down to the waterside to fill it and once as he descended the steep slope of the glen he heard the covert rustle and saw the leaves stir as though something moved behind them as he looked silence fell and the leaves grew still but his heart was shaken for it seemed to him that what he had seen in the dusk had a human semblance such as the woodpeople wear and he was loth to think that such unhallowed beings haunted the glen a few days passed and again descending to the stream he saw a figure flit by him through the covert and this time a deeper fear entered into him but he put away the thought and prayed fervently for all souls in temptation and when he spoke with the wild woman again on the feast of the seven maccabees which falls on the first day of august he was smitten with fear to see her wasted looks and besought her to cease from labouring and let him minister to her in her weakness but she denied him gently and replied that all she asked of him was to keep her steadfastly in his prayers before the feast of the assumption the rains ceased and the plague which had begun to show itself was stayed but the ardency of the sun grew greater and the hermits cliff was a fiery furnace never had such heat been known in those regions but the people did not murmur for with the cessation of the rain their crops were saved and the pestilence banished and these mercies they ascribed in great part to the prayers and macerations of the two holy anchorets therefore on the eve of the assumption they sent a messenger to the hermit saying that at daylight on the morrow the townspeople and all the dwellers in the valley would come forth led by their bishop who bore the popes blessing to the two solitaries and who was mindful to celebrate the mass of the assumption in the hermits cave in the cliffside at the blessed word the hermit was wellnigh distraught with joy for he felt this to be a sign from heaven that his prayers were heard and that he had won the wild womans grace as well as his own and all night he prayed that on the morrow she might confess her fault and receive the sacrament with him before dawn he recited the psalms of the proper nocturn then he girded on his gown and sandals and went forth to meet the bishop in the valley as he went downward daylight stood on the mountains and he thought he had never seen so fair a dawn it filled the farthest heaven with brightness and penetrated even to the woody crevices of the glen as the grace of god had entered into the obscurest folds of his heart the morning airs were hushed and he heard only the sound of his own footfall and the murmur of the stream which though diminished still poured a swift current between the rocks but as he reached the bottom of the glen a sound of chanting came to him and he knew that the pilgrims were at hand his heart leapt up and his feet hastened forward but at the streamside they were suddenly stayed for in a pool where the water was still deep he saw the shining of a womans body and on a stone hard by lay the wild womans gown and sandals fear and rage possessed the hermits heart and he stood as one smitten speechless covering his eyes from the shame but the song of the approaching pilgrims swelled ever louder and nearer and finding voice he cried to the wild woman to come forth and hide herself from the people she made no answer but in the dusk he saw her limbs sway with the swaying of the water and her eyes were turned to him as if in mockery at the sight blind fury filled him and clambering over the rocks to the pools edge he bent down and caught her by the shoulder at that moment he could have strangled her with his hands so abhorrent to him was the touch of her flesh but as he cried out on her heaping her with cruel names he saw that her eyes returned his look without wavering and suddenly it came to him that she was dead then through all his anger and fear a great pang smote him for here was his work undone and one he had loved in christ laid low in her sin in spite of all his labours one moment pity possessed him the next he bethought him how the people would find him bending above the body of a naked woman whom he had held up to them as holy but whom they might now well take for the secret instrument of his undoing and beholding how at her touch all the slow edifice of his holiness was demolished and his soul in mortal jeopardy he felt the earth reel round him and his sight grew red already the head of the procession had entered the glen and the stillness shook with the great sound of the salve regina when the hermit opened his eyes once more the air was quivering with thronged candleflames which glittered on the gold thread of priestly vestments and on the blazing monstrance beneath its canopy and close above him was bent the bishops face the hermit struggled to his knees my father in god he cried behold for my sins i have been visited by a demon but as he spoke he perceived that those about him no longer heeded him and that the bishop and all his clergy had fallen on their knees about the pool then the hermit following their gaze saw that the brown waters of the pool covered the wild womans limbs as with a garment and that about her floating head a great light floated and to the utmost edges of the throng a cry of praise went up for many were there whom the wild woman had healed and comforted and who read gods mercy in this wonder but fresh fear fell on the hermit for he had cursed a dying saint and denounced her aloud to all the people and this new anguish coming so close upon the other smote down his weakened frame so that his limbs failed him and he sank once more to the ground again the earth reeled about him and the bending faces grew remote but as he forced his weak voice once more to proclaim his sins he felt the blessed touch of absolution and the holy oils of the last voyage laid on his lips and eyes peace returned to him then and with it a great longing to look once more upon his lauds as he had dreamed of doing at his last hour but he was too far gone to make this longing known and so tried to banish it from his mind yet in his weakness the wish held him and the tears ran down his face then as he lay there feeling the earth slip from under him and the everlasting arms replace it he heard a great peal of voices that seemed to come down from the sky and mingle with the singing of the throng and the words of the chant were the words of his own lauds so long hidden in the secret of his breast and now rejoicing above him through the spheres and his soul rose on the chant and soared with it to the seat of mercy the last asset i the devil paul garnett exclaimed as he reread his note and the dry old gentleman who was at the moment his only neighbour in the quiet restaurant they both frequented remarked with a smile you dont seem particularly annoyed at meeting him garnett returned the smile i dont know why i apostrophized him for hes not in the least present except inasmuch as he may prove to be at the bottom of anything unexpected the old gentleman who like garnett was an american and spoke in the thin rarefied voice which seems best fitted to emit sententious truths twisted his lean neck toward the younger man and cackled out shrewdly ah its generally a woman who is at the bottom of the unexpected not he added leaning forward with deliberation to select a toothpick that that precludes the devils being there too garnett uttered the requisite laugh and his neighbour pushing back his plate called out with a perfectly unbending american intonation gassong laddition silver play his repast as usual had been a simple one and he left only thirty centimes in the plate on which his account was presented but the waiter to whom he was evidently a familiar presence received the tribute with latin affability and hovered helpfully about the table while the old gentleman cut and lighted his cigar yes the latter proceeded revolving the cigar meditatively between his thin lips theyre generally both in the same hole like the owl and the prairiedog in the natural history books of my youth i believe it was all a mistake about the owl and the prairiedog but it isnt about the unexpected the fact is the unexpected is the devil the sooner you find that out the happier youll be he leaned back tilting his smooth bald head against the blotched mirror behind him and rambling on with gentle garrulity while garnett attacked his omelet get your life down to routine eliminate surprises arrange things so that when you get up in the morning youll know exactly what is going to happen to you during the day and the next day and the next i dont say its funny it aint but its better than being hit on the head by a brickbat thats why i always take my meals at this restaurant i know just how much onion they put in things if i went to the next place i shouldnt and i always take the same streets to come here ive been doing it for ten years now i know at which crossings to look out i know what im going to see in the shopwindows it saves a lot of wear and tear to know whats coming for a good many years i never did know from one minute to another and now i like to think that everythings cutanddried and nothing unexpected can jump out at me like a tramp from a ditch he paused calmly to knock the ashes from his cigar and garnett said with a smile doesnt such a plan of life cut off nearly all the possibilities the old gentleman made a contemptuous motion possibilities of what of being multifariously miserable there are lots of ways of being miserable but theres only one way of being comfortable and that is to stop running round after happiness if you make up your mind not to be happy theres no reason why you shouldnt have a fairly good time that was schopenhauers idea i believe the young man said pouring his wine with the smile of youthful incredulity i guess he hadnt the monopoly responded his friend lots of people have found out the secret the trouble is that so few live up to it he rose from his seat pushing the table forward and standing passive while the waiter advanced with his shabby overcoat and umbrella then he nodded to garnett lifted his hat politely to the broadbosomed lady behind the desk and passed out into the street garnett looked after him with a musing smile the two had exchanged views on life for two years without so much as knowing each others names garnett was a newspaper correspondent whose work kept him mainly in london but on his periodic visits to paris he lodged in a dingy hotel of the latin quarter the chief merit of which was its nearness to the cheap and excellent restaurant where the two americans had made acquaintance but garnetts assiduity in frequenting the place arose in the end less from the excellence of the food than from the enjoyment of his old friends conversation amid the flashy sophistications of the parisian life to which garnetts trade introduced him the american sages conversation had the crisp and homely flavor of a native dish one of the domestic compounds for which the exiled palate is supposed to yearn it was a mark of the old mans impersonality that in spite of the interest he inspired garnett had never got beyond idly wondering who he might be where he lived and what his occupations were he was presumably a bachelor a man of family ties however relaxed though he might have been as often absent from home would not have been as regularly present in the same place and there was about him a boundless desultoriness which renewed garnetts conviction that there is no one on earth as idle as an american who is not busy from certain allusions it was plain that he had lived many years in paris yet he had not taken the trouble to adapt his tongue to the local inflections but spoke french with the accent of one who has formed his conception of the language from a phrasebook the city itself seemed to have made as little impression on him as its speech he appeared to have no artistic or intellectual curiosities to remain untouched by the complex appeal of paris while preserving perhaps the more strikingly from his very detachment that odd american astuteness which seems the fruit of innocence rather than of experience his nationality revealed itself again in a mild interest in the political problems of his adopted country though they appeared to preoccupy him only as illustrating the boundless perversity of mankind the exhibition of human folly never ceased to divert him and though his examples of it seemed mainly drawn from the columns of one exiguous daily paper he found there matter for endless variations on his favorite theme if this monotony of topic did not weary the younger man it was because he fancied he could detect under it the tragic implication of the fixed idea of some great moral upheaval which had flung his friend stripped and starving on the desert island of the little cafe where they met he hardly knew wherein he read this revelation whether in the resigned shabbiness of the sages dress the impartial courtesy of his manner or the shade of apprehension which lurked indescribably in his guileless yet suspicious eye there were moments when garnett could only define him by saying that he looked like a man who had seen a ghost ii an apparition almost as startling had come to garnett himself in the shape of the mauve note received from his concierge as he was leaving the hotel for luncheon not that on the face of it a missive announcing mrs sam newells arrival at ritzs and her need of his presence there that afternoon at five carried any special mark of the portentous it was not her being at ritzs that surprised him the fact that she was chronically hard up and had once or twice lately been so brutally confronted with the consequences as to accept indeed solicit a loan of five pounds from him this circumstance as garnett knew would never be allowed to affect the general tenor of her existence if one came to paris where could one go but to ritzs did he see her in some grubby hole across the river or in a family pension near the place de letoile there was no affectation in her tendency to gravitate toward what was costliest and most conspicuous in doing so she obeyed one of the profoundest instincts of her nature and it was another instinct which taught her to gratify the first at any cost even to that of dipping into the pocket of an impecunious newspaper correspondent it was a part of her strength and of her charm too that she did such things naturally openly without any of the ugly grimaces of dissimulation or compunction her recourse to garnett had of course marked a specially low ebb in her fortunes save in moments of exceptional dearth she had richer sources of supply and he was nearly sure that by running over the society column of the paris herald he should find an explanation not perhaps of her presence at ritzs but of her means of subsistence there what really perplexed him was not the financial but the social aspect of the case when mrs newell had left london in july she had told him that between cowes and scotland she and hermy were provided for till the middle of october after that as she put it they would have to look about why then when she had in her hand the opportunity of living for three months at the expense of the british aristocracy did she rush off to paris at heaven knew whose expense in the beginning of september she was not a woman to act incoherently if she made mistakes they were not of that kind garnett felt sure she would never willingly relax her hold on her distinguished friends was it possible that it was they who had somewhat violently let go of her as garnett reviewed the situation he began to see that this possibility had for some time been latent in it he had felt that something might happen at any moment and was not this the something he had obscurely foreseen mrs newell really moved too fast her position was as perilous as that of an invading army without a base of supplies she used up everything too quickly friends credit influence forbearance it was so easy for her to acquire all these what a pity she had never learned to keep them he himself for instance the most insignificant of her acquisitions was beginning to feel like a squeezed sponge at the mere thought of her and it was this sense of exhaustion of the inability to provide more either materially or morally which had provoked his exclamation on opening her note from the first days of their acquaintance her prodigality had amazed him but he had believed it to be surpassed by the infinity of her resources if she exhausted old supplies she always found new ones to replace them when one set of people began to find her impossible another was always beginning to find her indispensable yes but there were limits there were only so many sets of people at least in her social classification and when she came to an end of them what then was this flight to paris a sign that she had come to an end was she going to try paris because london had failed her the time of year precluded such a conjecture mrs newells paris was nonexistent in september the town was a desert of gaping trippers he could as soon think of her seeking social restoration at margate for a moment it occurred to him that she might have to come over to replenish her wardrobe but he knew her dates too well to dwell long on this hope it was in april and december that she visited the dressmakers before december he had heard her explain one got nothing but the american fashions mrs newells scorn of all things american was somewhat illogically coupled with the determination to use her own americanism to the utmost as a means of social advance she had found out long ago that on certain lines it paid in london to be american and she had manufactured for herself a personality independent of geographical or social demarcations and presenting that remarkable blend of plantation dialect bowery slang and hyperbolic statement which is the british nobilitys favorite idea of an unadulterated americanism mrs newell for all her talents was not naturally either humorous or hyperbolic and there were times when it would doubtless have been a relief to her to be as monumentally stolid as some of the persons whose dulness it was her fate to enliven it was perhaps the need of relaxing which had drawn her into her odd intimacy with garnett with whom she did not have to be either scrupulously english or artificially american since the impression she made on him was of no more consequence than that which she produced on her footman garnett was perfectly aware that he owed his success to his insignificance but the fact affected him only as adding one more element to his knowledge of mrs newells character he was as ready to sacrifice his personal vanity in such a cause as he had been at the outset of their acquaintance to sacrifice his professional pride to the opportunity of knowing her when he had accepted the position of london correspondent with an occasional sideglance at paris to the new york searchlight he had not understood that his work was to include the obligation of interviewing indeed had the possibility presented itself in advance he would have met it by unpacking his valise and returning to the drudgery of his assistanteditorship in new york but when after three months in europe he received a letter from his chief suggesting that he should enliven the sunday searchlight by a series of talks with smart americans in london beginning say with mrs sam newell the change of focus already enabled him to view the proposal without passion for his life on the edge of the great worldcaldron of art politics and pleasure of that highspiced brew which is nowhere else so subtly and variously compounded had bred in him an eager appetite to taste of the heady mixture he knew he should never have the full spoon at his lips but he recalled the peasantgirl in one of brownings plays who has once eaten polenta cut with a knife which has carved an ortolan might not mrs newell who had so successfully cut a way into the dense and succulent mass of english society serve as the knife to season his polenta he had expected as the result of the interview to which she promptly almost eagerly assented no more than the glimpse of brightly lit vistas which a waiting messenger may catch through open doors but instead he had found himself drawn at once into the inner sanctuary not of london society but of mrs newells relation to it she had been candidly charmed by the idea of the interview it struck him that she was conscious of the need of being freshened up her appearance was brilliantly fresh with the inveterate freshness of the toilettable her paint was as impenetrable as armor but her personality was a little tarnished she was in want of social renovation she had been doing and saying the same things for too long a time london cowes homburg scotland monte carlo that had been the round since hermy was a baby hermy was her daughter miss hermione newell who was called in presently to be shown off to the interviewer and add a paragraph to the celebration of her mothers charms miss newells appearance was so full of an unassisted freshness that for a moment garnett made the mistake of fancying that she could fill a paragraph of her own but he soon found that her vague personality was merely tributary to her parents that her youth and grace were in some mysterious way her mothers rather than her own she smiled obediently on garnett but could contribute little beyond her smile and the general sweetness of her presence to the picture of mrs newells existence which it was the young mans business to draw and presently he found that she had left the room without his noticing it he learned in time that this unnoticeableness was the most conspicuous thing about her burning at best with a mild light she became invisible in the glare of her mothers personality it was in fact only as a product of her environment that poor hermione struck the imagination with the smartest woman in london as her guide and example she had never developed a taste for dress and with opportunities for enlightenment from which garnetts fancy recoiled she remained simple unsuspicious and tender with an inclination to good works and afternoon church a taste for the society of dull girls and a clinging fidelity to old governesses and retired nursemaids mrs newell whose boast it was that she looked facts in the face frankly owned that she had not been able to make anything of hermione if she has a role i havent discovered it she confessed to garnett ive tried everything but she doesnt fit in anywhere mrs newell spoke as if her daughter were a piece of furniture acquired without due reflection and for which no suitable place could be found she got of course what she could out of hermione who wrote her notes ran her errands saw tiresome people for her and occupied an intermediate office between that of ladys maid and secretary but such small returns on her investment were not what mrs newell had counted on what was the use of producing and educating a handsome daughter if she did not in some more positive way contribute to her parents advancement iii its about hermy mrs newell said rising from the heap of embroidered cushions which formed the background of her afternoon repose her sittingroom at ritzs was full of penetrating warmth and fragrance longstemmed roses filled the vases on the chimneypiece in which a fire sparkled with that effect of luxury which fires produce when the weather is not cold enough to justify them on the writingtable among notes and cards and signed photographs of celebrities mrs newells gold inkstand her jewelled penholder her heavilymonogrammed despatchbox gave back from their expensive surfaces the glint of the flame which sought out and magnified the orient of the pearls among the ladys laces and found a mirror in the pinky polish of her fingertips it was just such a scene as a little september fire lit for show and not for warmth would delight to dwell on and pick out in all its opulent details and even garnett inured to mrs newells capacity for extracting manna from the desert reflected that she must have found new fields to glean its about hermy she repeated making room for him among the cushions i had to see you at once we came over yesterday from london garnett seating himself continued his leisurely survey of the room in the glitter of mrs newells magnificence hermione as usual faded out of sight and he hardly noticed her mothers allusion i have never seen you more resplendent he remarked she received the tribute with complacency the rooms are not bad are they we came over with the woolsey hubbards youve heard of them of course theyre from detroit and really they do things very decently their motorcar met us at boulogne and the courier always wires ahead to have the rooms filled with flowers this salon is really a part of their suite i simply couldnt have afforded it myself she delivered these facts in a high decisive voice which had a note akin to the clink of her many bracelets and the rattle of her ringed hands against the enamelled cigarettecase which she extended to garnett after helping herself from its contents you are always meeting such charming people said garnett with mild irony and reverting to her first remark he bethought himself to add i hope miss hermione is not ill ill she was never ill in her life exclaimed mrs newell as though her daughter had been accused of an indelicacy it was only that you said you had come over on her account so i have hermione is to be married mrs newell brought out the words impressively drawing back to observe their effect on her visitor it was such that he received them with a long silent stare which finally passed into a cry of wonder married for heavens sake to whom mrs newell continued to regard him with a smile so serene and victorious that he saw she took his somewhat unseemly astonishment as a merited tribute to her genius presently she extended a glittering hand and took a sheet of note paper from the blotter you can have that put in tomorrows herald she said garnett receiving the paper read in hermiones own finished hand a marriage has been arranged and will shortly take place between the comte louis du trayas son of the marquis du trayas de la baume and miss hermione newell daughter of samuel c newell esqre of elmira n y comte louis du trayas belongs to one of the oldest and most distinguished families in france and is equally well connected in england being the nephew of lord saint priscoe and a cousin of the countess of morningfield whom he frequently visits at adham and portlow the perusal of this document filled garnett with such deepening wonder that he could not for the moment even do justice to the strangeness of its being written out for publication in the brides own hand hermione a bride hermione a future countess hermione on the brink of a marriage which would give her not only a great situation in the parisian world but a footing in some of the best houses in england regardless of its unflattering implications garnett prolonged his stare of mute amazement till mrs newell somewhat sharply exclaimed well didnt i always tell you that she would marry a frenchman garnett in spite of himself smiled at this revised version of his hostesss frequent assertion that hermione was too goodygoody to take in england but that with her little dowdy air she might very well go off in the faubourg if only a dot could be raked up for her and the recollection flashed a new light on the versatility of mrs newells genius but how did you do it was on the tip of his tongue and he had barely time to give the query the more conventional turn of how did it happen oh we were up at glaish with the edmund fitzarthurs lady edmund is a sort of cousin of the morningfields who have a shootinglodge near glaish a place called portlow and young trayas was there with them lady edmund who is a dear drove hermy over to portlow and the thing was done in no time he simply fell over head and ears in love with her you know hermy is really very handsome in her peculiar way i dont think you have ever appreciated her mrs newell summed up with a note of exquisite reproach ive appreciated her i assure you but one somehow didnt think of her marrying so soon soon shes threeandtwenty but youve no imagination said mrs newell and garnett inwardly admitted that he had not enough to soar to the heights of her invention for the marriage of course was an invention of her own a superlative stroke of business in which he was sure the principal parties had all been passive agents in which everyone from the bankrupt and disreputable fitzarthurs to the rich and immaculate morningfields had by some mysterious sleight of hand been made to fit into mrs newells designs but it was not enough for garnett to marvel at her work he wanted to understand it to take it apart to find out how the trick had been done it was true that mrs newell had always said hermy might go off in the faubourg if she had a dot but even mrs newells juggling could hardly conjure up a dot such feats as she was able to perform in this line were usually made to serve her own urgent necessities and besides who was likely to take sufficient interest in hermione to supply her with the means of marrying a french nobleman the flowers ordered in advance by the woolsey hubbards courier made garnett wonder if that accomplished functionary had also wired over to have miss newells settlements drawn up but of all the comments hovering on his lips the only one he could decently formulate was the remark that he supposed mrs newell and her daughter had come over to see the young mans family and make the final arrangements oh theyre made everything is settled said mrs newell looking him squarely in the eye youre wondering of course about the dot frenchmen never go off their heads to the extent of forgetting that or at least their parents dont allow them to garnett murmured a vague assent and she went on without the least appearance of resenting his curiosity it all came about so fortunately only fancy just the week they met i got a little legacy from an aunt in elmira a good soul i hadnt seen or heard of for years i suppose i ought to have put on mourning for her by the way but it would have eaten up a good bit of the legacy and i really needed it all for poor hermy oh its not a fortune you understand but the young man is madly in love and has always had his own way so after a lot of correspondence its been arranged they saw hermy this morning and theyre enchanted and the marriage takes place very soon yes in a few weeks here his mother is an invalid and couldnt have gone to england besides the french dont travel and as hermy has become a catholic already mrs newell stared it doesnt take long and it suits hermy exactly she can go to church so much oftener so i thought mrs newell concluded with dignity that a wedding at saint philippe du roule would be the most suitable thing at this season dear me said garnett i am left breathless i cant catch up with you i suppose even the day is fixed though miss hermione doesnt mention it and he indicated the official announcement in his hand mrs newell laughed hermy had to write that herself poor dear because my scrawls too hideous but i dictated it no the day isnt fixed thats why i sent for you there was a splendid directness about mrs newell it would never have occurred to her to pretend to garnett that she had summoned him for the pleasure of his company youve sent for me to fix the day he enquired humourously to remove the last obstacle to its being fixed i what kind of an obstacle could i have the least effect on mrs newell met his banter with a look which quelled it i want you to find her father her father miss hermiones my husband of course i suppose you know hes living garnett blushed at his own clumsiness i yes that is i really knew nothing he stammered feeling that each word added to it if hermione was unnoticeable mr newell had always been invisible the young man had never so much as given him a thought and it was awkward to come on him so suddenly at a turn of the talk well he is living here in paris said mrs newell with a note of asperity which seemed to imply that her friend might have taken the trouble to post himself on this point in paris but in that case isnt it quite simple to find him i daresay it wont be difficult though he is rather mysterious but the point is that i cant go to him and that if i write to him he wont answer ah said garnett thoughtfully and so youve got to find him for me and tell him tell him what that he must come to the wedding that we must show ourselves together at church and at the breakfast she delivered the behest in her sharp imperative key the tone of the born commander but for once garnett ventured to question her orders and supposing he wont come he must if he cares for his daughters happiness she cant be married without him cant be married the french are like that especially the old families i was given to understand at once that my husband must appear if only to establish the fact that were not divorced ah youre not then escaped from garnett mercy no divorce is stupid they dont like it in europe and in this case it would have been the end of hermys marriage they wouldnt think of letting their son marry the child of divorced parents how fortunate then yes but i always think of such things beforehand and of course ive told them that my husband will be present you think he will consent no not at first but you must make him you must tell him how sweet hermione is and you must see louis and be able to describe their happiness you must dine here tonight he is coming were all dining with the hubbards and they expect you they have given hermy some very good diamonds though i should have preferred a cheque as shell be horribly poor but i think kate hubbard means to do something about the trousseau hermy is at paquins with her now youve no idea how delightful all our friends have been ah here is one of them now she broke off smiling as the door opened to admit without preliminary announcement a gentleman so glossy and ancient with such a fixed unnatural freshness of smile and eye that he gave garnett the effect of having been embalmed and then enamelled it needed not the exoticlooking ribbon in the visitors buttonhole nor mrs newells introduction of him as her friend baron schenkelderff to assure garnett of his connection with a race as ancient as his appearance baron schenkelderff greeted his hostess with paternal playfulness and the young man with an ease which might have been acquired on the stock exchange and in the dressingrooms of leading ladies he spoke a faultless colourless english from which one felt he might pass with equal mastery to half a dozen other languages he enquired patronizingly for the excellent hubbards asked his hostess if she did not mean to give him a drop of tea and a cigarette remarked that he need not ask if hermione was still closeted with the dressmaker and on the waiters coming in answer to his ring ordered the tea himself and added a request for fine champagne it was not the first time that garnett had seen such minor liberties taken in mrs newells drawingroom but they had hitherto been taken by persons who had at least the superiority of knowing what they were permitting themselves whereas the young man felt almost sure that baron schenkelderffs manner was the most distinguished he could achieve and this deepened the disgust with which as the minutes passed he yielded to the conviction that the baron was mrs newells aunt iv garnett had always foreseen that mrs newell might some day ask him to do something he should greatly dislike he had never gone so far as to conjecture what it might be but had simply felt that if he allowed his acquaintance with her to pass from spectatorship to participation he must be prepared to find himself at any moment in a queer situation the moment had come and he was relieved to find that he could meet it by refusing her request he had not always been sure that she would leave him this alternative she had a way of involving people in her complications without their being aware of it and garnett had pictured himself in holes so tight that there might not be room for a wriggle happily in this case he could still move freely nothing compelled him to act as an intermediary between mrs newell and her husband and it was preposterous to suppose that even in a life of such perpetual upheaval as hers there were no roots which struck deeper than her casual intimacy with himself she had simply laid hands on him because he happened to be within reach and he would put himself out of reach by leaving for london on the morrow having thus inwardly asserted his independence he felt free to let his fancy dwell on the strangeness of the situation he had always supposed that mrs newell in her flight through life must have thrown a good many victims to the wolves and had assumed that mr newell had been among the number that he had been dropped overboard at an early stage in the ladys career seemed probable from the fact that neither his wife nor his daughter ever mentioned him mrs newell was incapable of reticence and if her husband had still been an active element in her life he would certainly have figured in her conversation garnett if he thought of the matter at all had concluded that divorce must long since have eliminated mr newell but he now saw how he had underrated his friends faculty for using up the waste material of life she had always struck him as the most extravagant of women yet it turned out that by a miracle of thrift she had for years kept a superfluous husband on the chance that he might some day be useful to her the day had come and mr newell was to be called from his obscurity garnett wondered what had become of him in the interval and in what shape he would respond to the evocation the fact that his wife feared he might not respond to it at all seemed to show that his exile was voluntary or had at least come to appear preferable to other alternatives but if that were the case it was curious that he should not have taken legal means to free himself he could hardly have had his wifes motives for wishing to maintain the vague tie between them but conjecture lost itself in trying to picture what his point of view was likely to be and garnett on his way to the hubbards dinner that evening could not help regretting that circumstances denied him the opportunity of meeting so enigmatic a person the young mans knowledge of mrs newells methods made him feel that her husband might be an interesting study this however did not affect his resolve to keep clear of the business he entered the hubbards diningroom with the firm intention of refusing to execute mrs newells commission and if he changed his mind in the course of the evening it was not owing to that ladys persuasions garnetts curiosity as to the hubbards share in hermiones marriage was appeased before he had been seated five minutes at their table mrs woolsey hubbard was an expansive blonde whose ample but disciplined outline seemed the result of a wellmatched struggle between her cook and her corsetmaker she talked a great deal of what was appropriate in dress and conduct and seemed to regard mrs newell as a final arbiter on both points to do or to wear anything inappropriate would have been extremely mortifying to mrs hubbard and she was evidently resolved at the price of eternal vigilance to prove her familiarity with what she frequently referred to as the right thing mr hubbard appeared to have no such preoccupations garnett if called upon to describe him would have done so by saying that he was the american who always pays the young man in the course of his foreign wanderings had come across many fellowcitizens of mr hubbards type in the most diverse company and surroundings and wherever they were to be found they always had their hands in their pockets mr hubbards standard of gentility was the extent of a mans capacity to foot the bill and as no one but an occasional compatriot cared to dispute the privilege with him he seldom had reason to doubt his social superiority garnett nevertheless did not believe that this lavish pair were as mrs newell would have phrased it putting up hermiones dot they would go very far in diamonds but they would hang back from securities their readiness to pay was indefinably mingled with a dread of being expected to and their prodigalities would take flight at the first hint of coercion mrs newell who had had a good deal of experience in managing this type of millionaire could be trusted not to arouse their susceptibilities and garnett was therefore certain that the chimerical legacy had been extracted from other pockets there were none in view but those of baron schenkelderff who seated at mrs hubbards right with a new order in his buttonhole and a fresh glaze upon his features enchanted that lady by his careless references to crowned heads and his condescending approval of the champagne garnett was more than ever certain that it was the baron who was paying and it was this conviction which made him suddenly feel that at any cost hermiones marriage must take place he had felt no special interest in the marriage except as one more proof of mrs newells extraordinary capacity but now it appealed to him from the girls own standpoint for he saw with a touch of compunction that in the mephitic air of her surroundings a lovestory of surprising freshness had miraculously flowered he had only to intercept the glances which the young couple exchanged to find himself transported to the candid region of romance it was evident that hermione adored and was adored that the lovers believed in each other and in every one about them and that even the legacy of the defunct aunt had not been too great a strain on their faith in human nature his first glance at the comte louis du trayas showed garnett that by some marvel of fitness hermione had happened upon a kindred nature if the young mans long mild features and shortsighted glance revealed no special force of character they showed a benevolence and simplicity as incorruptible as her own and declared that their possessor whatever his failings would never imperil the illusions she had so miraculously preserved the fact that the girl took her good fortune naturally and did not regard herself as suddenly snatched from the jaws of death added poignancy to the situation for if she missed this way of escape and was thrown back on her former life the day of discovery could not be long deferred it made garnett shiver to think of her growing old between her mother and schenkelderff or such successors of the barons as might probably attend on mrs newells waning fortunes for it was clear to him that the baron marked the first stage in his friends decline when garnett took leave that evening he had promised mrs newell that he would try to find her husband v if mr newell read in the papers the announcement of his daughters marriage it did not cause him to lift the veil of seclusion in which his wife represented him as shrouded a round of the american banks in paris failed to give garnett his address and it was only in chance talk with one of the young secretaries of the embassy that he was put on mr newells track the secretarys father it appeared had known the newells some twenty years earlier he had had business relations with mr newell who was then a man of property with factories or something of the kind the narrator thought somewhere in western new york there had been at this period for mrs newell a phase of large hospitality and showy carriages in washington and at narragansett then her husband had had reverses had lost heavily in wall street and had finally drifted abroad and been lost to sight the young man did not know at what point in his financial decline mr newell had parted company with his wife and daughter though you may bet your hat he philosophically concluded that the old girl hung on as long as there were any pickings he did not himself know mr newells address but opined that it might be extracted from a certain official at the consulate if garnett could give a sufficiently good reason for the request and here in fact mrs newells emissary learned that her husband was to be found in an obscure street of the luxembourg quarter in order to be near the scene of action garnett went to breakfast at his usual haunt determined to despatch his business as early in the day as politeness allowed the head waiter welcomed him to a table near that of the transatlantic sage who sat in his customary corner his head tilted back against the blistered mirror at an angle suggesting that in a freer civilization his feet would have sought the same level he greeted garnett affably and the two exchanged their usual generalizations on life till the sage rose to go whereupon it occurred to garnett to accompany him his friend took the offer in good part merely remarking that he was going to the luxembourg gardens where it was his invariable habit on good days to feed the sparrows with the remains of his breakfast roll and garnett replied that as it happened his own business lay in the same direction perhaps by the way he added you can tell me how to find the rue panonceaux where i must go presently i thought i knew this quarter fairly well but i have never heard of it his companion came to a sudden halt on the narrow sidewalk to the confusion of the dense and desultory traffic which marks the old streets of the latin quarter he fixed his mild eye on garnett and gave a twist to the cigar which lingered in the corner of his mouth the rue panonceaux it is an out of the way hole but i can tell you how to find it he answered he made no motion to do so however but continued to bend on the young man the full force of his interrogative gaze then he added abruptly would you mind telling me your object in going there garnett looked at him with surprise a question so unblushingly personal was strangely out of keeping with his friends usual attitude of detachment before he could reply however the other had quietly continued do you happen to be in search of samuel c newell why yes i am said garnett with a start of conjecture his companion uttered a sigh i supposed so he said resignedly and in that case he added we may as well have the matter out in the luxembourg garnett had halted before him with deepening astonishment but you dont mean to tell me he stammered the little man made a motion of assent i am samuel c newell he said drily and if you have no objection i prefer not to break through my habit of feeding the sparrows we are five minutes late as it is he quickened his pace without awaiting any reply from garnett who walked beside him in unsubdued wonder till they reached the luxembourg gardens where mr newell making for one of the less frequented alleys seated himself on a bench and drew the fragment of a roll from his pocket his coming was evidently expected for a shower of little dusky bodies at once descended on him and the gravel fluttered with battling wings and beaks as he distributed his dole with impartial gestures it was not till the ground was white with crumbs and the first frenzy of his pensioners appeased that he turned to garnett and said i presume sir that you come from my wife garnett coloured with embarrassment the more simply the old man took his mission the more complicated it appeared to himself from your wife and from miss newell he said at length you have perhaps heard that she is to be married oh yes i read the herald pretty faithfully said miss newells parent shaking out another handful of crumbs garnett cleared his throat then you have no doubt thought it natural that under the circumstances they should wish to communicate with you the sage continued to fix his attention on the sparrows my wife he remarked might have written to me mrs newell was afraid she might not hear from you in reply in reply why should she i suppose she merely wishes to announce the marriage she knows i have no money left to buy weddingpresents said mr newell astonishingly garnett felt his colour deepen he had a vague sense of standing as the representative of something guilty and enormous with which he had rashly identified himself i dont think you understand he said mrs newell and your daughter have asked me to see you because they are anxious that you should consent to appear at the wedding mr newell at this ceased to give his attention to the birds and turned a compassionate gaze upon garnett my dear sir i dont know your name he remarked would you mind telling me how long you have been acquainted with mrs newell and without waiting for an answer he added judicially if you wait long enough she will ask you to do some very disagreeable things for her this echo of his own thoughts gave garnett a sharp twinge of discomfort but he made shift to answer goodhumouredly if you refer to my present errand i must tell you that i dont find it disagreeable to do anything which may be of service to miss hermione mr newell fumbled in his pocket as though searching unavailingly for another morsel of bread then he said from her point of view i shall not be the most important person at the ceremony garnett smiled that is hardly a reason he began but he was checked by the brevity of tone with which his companion replied i am not aware that i am called upon to give you my reasons you are certainly not the young man rejoined except in so far as you are willing to consider me as the messenger of your wife and daughter oh i accept your credentials said the other with his dry smile what i dont recognize is their right to send a message this reduced garnett to silence and after a moments pause mr newell drew his watch from his pocket i am sorry to cut the conversation short but my days are mapped out with a certain regularity and this is the hour for my nap he rose as he spoke and held out his hand with a glint of melancholy humour in his small clear eyes you dismiss me then i am to take back a refusal the young man exclaimed my dear sir those ladies have got on very well without me for a number of years i imagine they can put through this wedding without my help you are mistaken then if it were not for that i shouldnt have undertaken this errand mr newell paused as he was turning away not for what he enquired the fact that as it happens the wedding cant be put through without your help mr newells thin lips formed a noiseless whistle theyve got to have my consent have they well is he a good young man the bridegroom garnett echoed in surprise i hear the best accounts of him and miss newell is very much in love her parent met this with an odd smile well then i give my consent its all ive got left to give he added philosophically garnett hesitated but if you consent if you approve why do you refuse your daughters request mr newell looked at him a moment ask mrs newell he said and as garnett was again silent he turned away with a slight gesture of leavetaking but in an instant the young man was at his side i will not ask your reasons sir he said but i will give you mine for being here miss newell cannot be married unless you are present at the ceremony the young mans parents know that she has a father living and they give their consent only on condition that he appears at her marriage i believe it is customary in old french families old french families be damned said mr newell with sudden vigour she had better marry an american and he made a more decided motion to free himself from garnetts importunities but his resistance only strengthened the young mans the more unpleasant the latters task became the more unwilling he grew to see his efforts end in failure during the three days which had been consumed in his quest it had become clear to him that the bridegrooms parents having been surprised into a reluctant consent were but too ready to withdraw it on the plea of mr newells nonappearance mrs newell on the last edge of tension had confided to garnett that the morningfields were being nasty and he could picture the whole powerful clan on both sides of the channel arrayed in a common resolve to exclude poor hermione from their ranks the very inequality of the contest stirred his blood and made him vow that in this case at least the sins of the parents should not be visited on the children in his talk with the young secretary he had obtained some glimpses of baron schenkelderffs past which fortified this resolve the baron at one time a familiar figure in a muchobserved london set had been mixed up in an ugly moneylending business ending in suicide which had excluded him from the society most accessible to his race his alliance with mrs newell was doubtless a desperate attempt at rehabilitation a forlorn hope on both sides but likely to be an enduring tie because it represented to both partners their last chance of escape from social extinction that hermiones marriage was a mere stake in their game did not in the least affect garnetts view of its urgency if on their part it was a sordid speculation to her it had the freshness of the first wooing if it made of her a mere pawn in their hands it would put her so garnett hoped beyond farther risk of such base uses and to achieve this had become a necessity to him the sense that if he lost sight of mr newell the latter might not easily be found again nerved garnett to hold his ground in spite of the resistance he encountered and he tried to put the full force of his plea into the tone with which he cried ah you dont know your daughter vi mrs newell that afternoon met him on the threshold of her sittingroom with a well of pentup anxiety in the room itself baron schenkelderff sat with crossed legs and head thrown back in an attitude which he did not see fit to alter at the young mans approach garnett hesitated but it was not the summariness of the barons greeting which he resented youve found him mrs newell exclaimed yes but she followed his glance and answered it with a slight shrug i cant take you into my room because theres a dressmaker there and she wont go because she is waiting to be paid schenkelderff she exclaimed youre not wanted please go and look out of the window the baron rose and lighting a cigarette laughingly retired to the embrasure mrs newell flung herself down and signed to garnett to take a seat at her side well youve found him youve talked with him yes i have talked with him for an hour she made an impatient movement thats too long does he refuse he doesnt consent then you mean he wants time to think it over time there is no time did you tell him so i told him so but you must remember that he has plenty he has taken twentyfour hours mrs newell groaned oh thats too much when he thinks things over he always refuses well he would have refused at once if i had not agreed to the delay she rose nervously from her seat and pressed her hands to her forehead its too hard after all ive done the trousseau is ordered think how disgraceful you must have managed him badly ill go and see him myself the baron at this turned abruptly from his study of the place vendome my dear creature for heavens sake dont spoil everything he exclaimed mrs newell coloured furiously whats the meaning of that brilliant speech i was merely putting myself in the place of a man on whom you have ceased to smile he picked up his hat and stick nodded knowingly to garnett and walked toward the door with an air of creaking jauntiness but on the threshold mrs newell waylaid him dont go i must speak to you she said following him into the antechamber and garnett remembered the dressmaker who was not to be dislodged from her bedroom in a moment mrs newell returned with a small flat packet which she vainly sought to dissemble in an inaccessible pocket he makes everything too odious she exclaimed but whether she referred to her husband or the baron it was left to garnett to decide she sat silent nervously twisting her cigarettecase between her fingers while her visitor rehearsed the details of his conversation with mr newell he did not indeed tell her the arguments he had used to shake her husbands resolve since in his eloquent sketch of hermiones situation there had perforce entered hints unflattering to her mother but he gave the impression that his hearer had in the end been moved and for that reason had consented to defer his refusal ah its not that its to prolong our misery mrs newell exclaimed and after a moment she added drearily he has been waiting for such an opportunity for years it seemed needless for garnett to protract his visit and he took leave with the promise to report at once the result of his final talk with mr newell but as he was passing through the antechamber a sidedoor opened and hermione stood before him her face was flushed and shaken out of its usual repose of line and he saw at once that she had been waiting for him mr garnett she said in a whisper he paused considering her with surprise he had never supposed her capable of such emotion as her voice and eyes revealed i want to speak to you we are quite safe here mamma is with the dressmaker she explained closing the door behind her while garnett laid aside his hat and stick i am at your service he said you have seen my father mamma told me that you were to see him today the girl went on standing close to him in order that she might not have to raise her voice yes i have seen him garnett replied with increasing wonder hermione had never before mentioned her father to him and it was by a slight stretch of veracity that he had included her name in her mothers plea to mr newell he had supposed her to be either unconscious of the transaction or else too much engrossed in her own happiness to give it a thought and he had forgiven her the last alternative in consideration of the abnormal character of her filial relations but now he saw that he must readjust his view of her you went to ask him to come to my wedding i know about it hermione continued of course it is the custom people will think it odd if he does not come she paused and then asked does he consent no he has not yet consented ah i thought so when i saw mamma just now but he hasnt quite refused he has promised to think it over but he hated it he hated the idea garnett hesitated it seemed to arouse painful associations ah it would it would she exclaimed he was astonished at the passion of her accent astonished still more at the tone with which she went on laying her hand on his arm mr garnett he must not be asked he has been asked too often to do things that he hated garnett looked at the girl with a shock of awe what abysses of knowledge did her purity hide but my dear miss hermione he began i know what you are going to say she interrupted him it is necessary that he should be present at the marriage or the du trayas will break it off they dont want it very much at any rate she added with a strange candour and they will not be sorry perhaps for of course louis would have to obey them so i explained to your father garnett assured her yes yes i knew you would put it to him but that makes no difference mr garnett he must not be forced to come unwillingly but if he sees the point after all no one can force him no but if it is painful to him if it reminds him too much oh mr garnett i was not a child when he left us i was old enough to see to see how it must hurt him even now to be reminded peace was all he asked for and i want him to be left in peace garnett paused in deep embarrassment my dear child there is no need to remind you that your own future she had a gesture that recalled her mother my future must take care of itself he must not be made to see us she said imperatively and as garnett remained silent she went on i have always hoped he did not hate me but he would hate me now if he were forced to see me not if he could see you at this moment he exclaimed she lifted her face with swimming eyes well go to him then tell him what i have said to you garnett continued to stand before her deeply struck it might be the best thing he reflected inwardly but he did not give utterance to the thought he merely put out his hand holding hermiones in a long pressure i will do whatever you wish he replied you understand that i am in earnest she urged tenaciously i am quite sure of it then i want you to repeat to him what i have said i want him to be left undisturbed i dont want him ever to hear of us again the next day at the appointed hour garnett resorted to the luxembourg gardens which mr newell had named as a meetingplace in preference to his own lodgings it was clear that he did not wish to admit the young man any further into his privacy than the occasion required and the extreme shabbiness of his dress hinted that pride might be the cause of his reluctance garnett found him feeding the sparrows but he desisted at the young mans approach and said at once you will not thank me for bringing you all this distance if that means that you are going to send me away with a refusal i have come to spare you the necessity garnett answered mr newell turned on him a glance of undisguised wonder in which an undertone of disappointment might almost have been detected ah theyve got no use for me after all be said ironically garnett in reply related without comment his conversation with hermione and the message with which she had charged him he remembered her words exactly and repeated them without modification heedless of what they implied or revealed mr newell listened with an immovable face occasionally casting a crumb to his flock when garnett ended he asked does her mother know of this assuredly not cried garnett with a movement of disgust you must pardon me but mrs newell is a very ingenious woman mr newell shook out his remaining crumbs and turned thoughtfully toward garnett you believe its quite clear to hermione that these people will use my refusal as a pretext for backing out of the marriage perfectly clear she told me so herself doesnt she consider the young man rather chickenhearted no he has already put up a big fight for her and you know the french look at these things differently hes only twentythree and his marrying against his parents approval is in itself an act of heroism yes i believe they look at it that way mr newell assented he rose and picked up the halfsmoked cigar which he had laid on the bench beside him what do they wear at these french weddings anyhow a dresssuit isnt it he asked the question was such a surprise to garnett that for the moment he could only stammer out you consent then i may go and tell her you may tell my girl yes he gave a vague laugh and added one way or another my wife always gets what she wants vii mr newells consent brought with it no accompanying concessions in the first flush of his success garnett had pictured himself as bringing together the father and daughter and hovering in an attitude of benediction over a family group in which mrs newell did not very distinctly figure but mr newells conditions were inflexible he would see the thing through for his daughters sake but he stipulated that in the meantime there should be no meetings or farther communications of any kind he agreed to be ready when garnett called for him at the appointed hour on the weddingday but until then he begged to be left alone to this decision he adhered immovably and when garnett conveyed it to hermione she accepted it with a deep look of understanding as for mrs newell she was too much engrossed in the nuptial preparations to give her husband another thought she had gained her point she had disarmed her foes and in the first flush of success she had no time to remember by what means her victory had been won even garnetts services received little recognition unless he found them sufficiently compensated by the new look in hermiones eyes the principal figures in mrs newells foreground were the woolsey hubbards and baron schenkelderff with these she was in hourly consultation and mrs hubbard went about aureoled with the importance of her close connection with an aristocratic marriage and dazzled by the barons familiarity with the intricacies of the almanach de gotha in his society and mrs newells mrs hubbard evidently felt that she had penetrated to the sacred precincts where the right thing flourished in its native soil as for hermione her look of happiness had returned but with an undertint of melancholy visible perhaps only to garnett but to him always hauntingly present outwardly she sank back into her passive self resigned to serve as the brilliant layfigure on which mrs newell hung the trophies of conquest preparations for the wedding were zealously pressed mrs newell knew the danger of giving people time to think things over and her fears about her husband being allayed she began to dread a new attempt at evasion on the part of the bridegrooms family the sooner its over the sounder i shall sleep she declared to garnett and all the mitigations of art could not conceal the fact that she was desperately in need of that restorative there were moments indeed when he was sorrier for her than for her husband or her daughter so black and unfathomable appeared the abyss into which she must slip back if she lost her hold on this last spar of safety but she did not lose her hold his own experience as well as her husbands declaration might have told him that she always got what she wanted how much she had wanted this particular thing was shown by the way in which on the last day when all peril was over she bloomed out in renovated splendour it gave garnett a shivering sense of the ugliness of the alternative which had confronted her the day came the showy coupe provided by mrs newell presented itself punctually at garnetts door and the young man entered it and drove to the rue panonceaus it was a little melancholy back street with lean old houses sweating rust and damp and glimpses of pitlife gardens black and sunless between walls bristling with iron spikes on the narrow pavement a blind man pottered along led by a redeyed poodle a little farther on a dishevelled woman sat grinding coffee on the threshold of a buvette the bridal carriage stopped before one of the doorways with a clatter of hoofs and harness which drew the neighbourhood to its windows and garnett started to mount the illsmelling stairs to the fourth floor on which he learned from the concierge that mr newell lodged but halfway up he met the latter descending and they turned and went down together hermiones parent wore his usual imperturbable look and his eye seemed as full as ever of generalisations on human folly but there was something oddly shrunken and submerged in his appearance as though he had grown smaller or his clothes larger and on the last hypothesis garnett paused for it became evident to him that mr newell had hired his dresssuit seated at the young mans side on the satin cushions he remained silent while the carriage rolled smoothly and rapidly through the network of streets leading to the boulevard saintgermain only once he remarked glancing at the elaborate fittings of the coupe is this mrs newells carriage i believe so yes garnett assented with the guilty sense that in defining that ladys possessions it was impossible not to trespass on those of her friends mr newell made no farther comment but presently requested his companion to rehearse to him once more the exact duties which were to devolve on him during the coming ceremony having mastered these he remained silent fixing a dry speculative eye on the panorama of the brilliant streets till the carriage drew up at the entrance of saint philippe du roule with the same air of composure he followed his guide through the mob of spectators and up the crimson velvet steps at the head of which but for a word from garnett a formidable suisse glittering with cocked hat and mace would have checked the advance of the small crumpled figure so oddly out of keeping with the magnificence of the bridal party the french fashion prescribing that the family cortege shall follow the bride to the altar the vestibule of the church was thronged with the participatore in the coming procession but if mr newell felt any nervousness at his sudden projection into this unfamiliar group nothing in his look or manner betrayed it he stood beside garnett till a whitefavoured carriage dashing up to the church with a superlative glitter of highly groomed horseflesh and silverplated harness deposited the snowy apparition of the bride supported by her mother then as hermione entered the vestibule he went forward quietly to meet her the girl wrapped in the haze of her bridal veil and a little confused perhaps by the anticipation of the meeting paused a moment as if in doubt before the small oddlyclad figure which blocked her path a horrible moment to garnett who felt a pang of misery at this satire on the infallibility of the filial instinct he longed to make some sign to break in some way the pause of uncertainty but before he could move he saw mrs newell give her daughter a sharp push he saw a blush of compunction flood hermiones face and the girl throwing back her veil bent her tall head and flung her arms about her father mr newell emerged unshaken from the embrace it seemed to have no effect beyond giving an odder twist to his tie he stood beside his daughter till the church doors were thrown open then at a sign from the verger he gave her his arm and the strange couple with the long train of fashion and finery behind them started on their march to the altar garnett had already slipped into the church and secured a post of vantage which gave him a sideview over the assemblage the building was thronged mrs newell had attained her ambition and given hermione a smart wedding garnetts eye travelled curiously from one group to another from the numerous representatives of the bridegrooms family all stamped with the same air of somewhat dowdy distinction the air of having had their thinking done for them for so long that they could no longer perform the act individually and the heterogeneous company of mrs newells friends who presented on the opposite side of the nave every variety of individual conviction in dress and conduct of the two groups the latter was decidedly the more interesting to garnett who observed that it comprised not only such recent acquisitions as the woolsey hubbards and the baron but also sundry more important figures which of late had faded to the verse of mrs newells horizon hermiones marriage had drawn them back bad once more made her mother a social entity had in short already accomplished the object for which it had been planned and executed and as he looked about him garnett saw that all the other actors in the show faded into insignificance beside the dominant figure of mrs newell became mere marionettes pulled hither and thither by the hidden wires of her intention one and all they were there to serve her ends and accomplish her purpose schenkelderff and the hubbards to pay for the show the bride and bridegroom to seal and symbolize her social rehabilitation garnett himself as the humble instrument adjusting the different parts of the complicated machinery and her husband finally as the last stake in her game the last asset on which she could draw to rebuild her fallen fortunes at the thought garnett was filled with a deep disgust for what the scene signified and for his own share in it he had been her tool and dupe like the others if he imagined that he was serving hermione it was for her mothers ends that he had worked what right had he to sentimentalise a marriage founded on such base connivances and how could he have imagined that in so doing he was acting a disinterested part while these thoughts were passing through his mind the ceremony had already begun and the principal personages in the drama were ranged before him in the row of crimson velvet chairs which fills the foreground of a catholic marriage through the glow of lights and the perfumed haze about the altar garnetts eyes rested on the central figures of the group and gradually the others disappeared from his view and his mind after all neither mrs newells schmes nor his own share in them could ever unsanctify hermiones marriage it was one more testimony to lifes indefatigable renewals to natures secret of drawing fragrance from corruption and as his eyes turned from the girls illuminated presence to the resigned and stoical figure sunk in the adjoining chair it occured to him that he had perhaps worked better than he knew in placing them if only for a moment side by side in trust in the good days just after we all left college ned halidon and i used to listen laughing and smoking while paul ambrose set forth his plans they were immense these plans involving as it sometimes seemed the ultimate aesthetic redemption of the whole human race and provisionally restoring the sense of beauty to those unhappy millions of our fellow countrymen who as ambrose movingly pointed out now live and die in surroundings of unperceived and unmitigated ugliness i want to bring the poor starved wretches back to their lost inheritance to the divine past theyve thrown away i want to make em hate ugliness so that theyll smash nearly everything in sight he would passionately exclaim stretching his arms across the shabby blackwalnut writingtable and shaking his thin consumptive fist in the fact of all the accumulated ugliness in the world you might set the example by smashing that table i once suggested with youthful brutality and paul pulling himself up cast a surprised glance at me and then looked slowly about the parental library in which we sat his parents were dead and he had inherited the house in seventeenth street where his grandfather ambrose had lived in a setting of black walnut and pier glasses giving madeira dinners and saying to his guests as they rejoined the ladies across a florid waste of aubusson carpet this sir is dabneys first study for the niagara the grecian slave in the bay window was executed for me in rome twenty years ago by my old friend ezra stimpson by token of which he passed for a maecenas in the new york of the forties and a poem had once been published in the keepsake or the book of beauty on a picture in the possession of jonathan ambrose esqre since then the house had remained unchanged pauls father a frugal liver and hardheaded manipulator of investments did not inherit old jonathans artistic sensibilities and was content to live and die in the unmodified black walnut and red rep of his predecessor it was only in paul that the grandfathers aesthetic faculty revived and mrs ambrose used often to say to her husband as they watched the little palebrowed boy poring over an old number of the art journal paul will know how to appreciate your fathers treasures in recognition of these transmitted gifts paul on leaving harvard was sent to paris with a tutor and established in a studio in which nothing was ever done he could not paint and recognized the fact early enough to save himself much wasted labor and his friends many painful efforts in dissimulation but he brought back a touching enthusiasm for the forms of beauty which an old civilization had revealed to him and an apostolic ardour in the cause of their dissemination he had paused in his harangue to take in my illtimed parenthesis and the color mounted slowly to his thin cheekbones it is an ugly room he owned as though he had noticed the library for the first time the desk was carved at the angles with the heads of helmeted knights with long blackwalnut moustaches the red cloth top was worn threadbare and patterned like a map with islands and peninsulas of ink and in its centre throned a massive bronze inkstand representing a syrian maiden slumbering by a well beneath a palmtree the fact is i said walking home that evening with ned halidon old paul will never do anything for the simple reason that hes too stingy ned who was an idealist shook his handsome head its not that my dear fellow he simply doesnt see things when theyre too close to him im glad you woke him up to that desk the next time i dined with paul he said when we entered the library and i had gently rejected one of his cheap cigars in favour of a superior article of my own look here ive been looking round for a decent writingtable i dont care as a rule to turn out old things especially when theyve done good service but i see now that this is too monstrous for an apostle of beauty to write his evangel on i agreed it is a little inappropriate except as an awful warning paul colored well but my dear fellow id no idea how much a table of this kind costs i find i cant get anything decent the plainest mahogany under a hundred and fifty he hung his head and pretended not to notice that i was taking out my own cigar well whats a hundred and fifty to you i rejoined you talk as if you had to live on a bookkeepers salary with a large family to support he smiled nervously and twirled the ring on his thin finger i know i know thats all very well but for twenty tables that i dont buy i can send some fellow abroad and unseal his eyes oh hang it do both i exclaimed impatiently but the writingtable was never bought the library remained as it was and so did the contention between halidon and myself as to whether this inconsistent acceptance of his surroundings was due on our friends part to a congenital inability to put his hand in his pocket or to a real unconsciousness of the ugliness that happened to fall inside his point of vision but he owned that the table was ugly i agreed yes but not till youd called his attention to the fact and ill wager he became unconscious of it again as soon as your back was turned not before hed had time to look at a lot of others and make up his mind that he couldnt afford to buy one that was just his excuse hed rather be thought mean than insensible to ugliness but the truth is that he doesnt mind the table and is used to it he knows his way about the drawers but he could get another with the same number of drawers too much trouble argued halidon too much money i persisted oh hang it now if he were mean would he have founded three travelling scholarships and be planning this big academy of arts well hes mean to himself at any rate yes and magnificently royally generous to all the world besides halidon exclaimed with one of his great flushes of enthusiasm but if on the whole the last word remained with halidon and ambroses personal chariness seemed a trifling foible compared to his altruistic breadth of intention yet neither of us could help observing as time went on that the habit of thrift was beginning to impede the execution of his schemes of artphilanthropy the three travelling scholarships had been founded in the first blaze of his ardour and before the personal management of his property had awakened in him the sleeping instincts of parsimony but as his capital accumulated and problems of investment and considerations of interest began to encroach upon his visionary hours we saw a gradual arrest in the practical development of his plan for every thousand dollars he talks of spending on his work i believe he knocks off a cigar or buys one less newspaper halidon grumbled affectionately but after all he went on with one of the quick revivals of optimism that gave a perpetual freshness to his spirit after all it makes one admire him all the more when one sees such a nature condemned to be at war with the petty inherited instinct of greed still i could see it was a disappointment to halidon that the great project of the academy of arts should languish on paper long after all its details had been discussed and settled to the satisfaction of the projector and of the expert advisers he had called in council hes quite right to do nothing in a hurry to take advice and compare ideas and points of view to collect and classify his material in advance halidon argued in answer to a taunt of mine about pauls perpetually reiterated plea that he was still waiting for soandsos report but now that the plans mature and such a plan youll grant its magnificent i should think hed burn to see it carried out instead of pottering over it till his enthusiasm cools and the whole business turns stale on his hands that summer ambrose went to europe and spent his holiday in a frugal walkingtour through brittany when he came back he seemed refreshed by his respite from business cares and from the interminable revision of his cherished scheme while contact with the concrete manifestations of beauty had as usual renewed his flagging ardour by jove he cried whenever i indulged my unworthy eyes in a long gaze at one of those big things picture or church or statue i kept saying to myself you lucky devil you to be able to provide such a sight as that for eyes that can make some good use of it isnt it better to give fifty fellows a chance to paint or carve or build than to be able to daub canvas or punch clay in a corner all by yourself well i said when he had worked off his first ebullition when is the foundation stone to be laid his excitement dropped the foundation stone when are you going to touch the electric button that sets the thing going paul with his hands in his sagging pockets began to pace the library hearthrug i can see him now setting his shabby red slippers between its ramified cabbages my dear fellow there are one or two points to be considered still one or two new suggestions i picked up over there i sat silent and he paused before me flushing to the roots of his thin hair you think ive had time enough that i ought to have put the thing through before this i suppose youre right i can see that even ned halidon thinks so and he has always understood my difficulties better than you have this insinuation exasperated me ned would have put it through years ago i broke out paul pulled at his straggling moustache you mean he has more executive capacity more no its not that hes not afraid to spend money and i am he suddenly exclaimed he had never before alluded to this weakness to either of us and i sat abashed suffering from his evident distress but he remained planted before me his little legs wide apart his eyes fixed on mine in an agony of voluntary selfexposure thats my trouble and i know it big sums frighten me i cant look them in the face by george i wish ned had the carrying out of this scheme i wish he could spend my money for me his face was lit by the reflection of a passing thought do you know i shouldnt wonder if i dropped out of the running before either of you chaps and in case i do ive half a mind to leave everything in trust to halidon and let him put the job through for me much better have your own fun with it i retorted but he shook his head saying with a sigh as he turned away its not fun to me thats the worst of it halidon to whom i could not help repeating our talk was amused and touched by his friends thought heaven knows what will become of the scheme if paul doesnt live to carry it out there are a lot of hungry ambrose cousins who will make one gulp of his money and never give a dollar to the work jove it would be a fine thing to have the carrying out of such a plan but hell do it yet youll see hell do it yet cried ned his old faith in his friend flaming up again through the wet blanket of fact ii paul ambrose did not die and leave his fortune to halidon but the following summer he did something far more unexpected he went abroad again and came back married now our busy fancy had never seen paul married even ned recognized the vague unlikelihood of such a metamorphosis hed stick at the parsons fee not to mention the best mans scarfpin and i should hate ned added sentimentally to see the touch of a womans hand desecrate the sublime ugliness of the ancestral home think of such a house made cozy but when the news came he would own neither to surprise nor to disappointment goodbye poor academy i exclaimed tossing over the bridegrooms eightpage rhapsody to halidon who had received its duplicate by the same post now why the deuce do you say that he growled i never saw such a beast as you are for imputing mean motives to defend myself from this accusation i put out my hand and recovered pauls letter here listen to this studying art in paris when i met her the vision and the faculty divine but lacking the accomplishment etc a little ethereal profile like one of piero della francescas angels not rich thank heaven but not afraid of money and already enamored of my project for fertilizing my sterile millions well why the deuce ned began again as though i had convicted myself out of my friends mouth and i could only grumble obscurely its all too pat he brushed aside my misgivings thank heaven she cant paint any how and now that i think of it pauls just the kind of chap who ought to have a dozen children ah then indeed goodbye poor academy i croaked the lady was lovely of that there could be no doubt and if paul now for a time forgot the academy his doing so was but a vindication of his sex halidon had only a glimpse of the returning couple before he was himself snatched up in one of the chariots of adventure that seemed perpetually waiting at his door this time he was going to the far east in the train of a special mission and his head was humming with new hopes and ardors but he had time for a last word with me about ambrose youll see youll see he summed up hopefully as we parted and what i was to see was of course the crowning pinnacle of the academy lifting itself against the horizon of the immediate future it was in the nature of things that i should meanwhile see less than formerly of the projector of that unrealized structure paul had a personal dread of society but he wished to show his wife to the world and i was not often a spectator on these occasions paul indeed good fellow tried to maintain the pretense of an unbroken intercourse and to this end i was asked to dine now and then but when i went i found guests of a new type who after dinner talked of sport and stocks while their host blinked at them silently through the smoke of his cheap cigars the first innovation that struck me was a sudden improvement in the quality of the cigars was this daisys doing mrs ambrose was daisy it was hard to tell she produced her results so noiselessly with her fair bent head and vague smile she seemed to watch life flow by without as yet trusting anything of her own to its current but she was watching at any rate and anything might come of that such modifications as she produced were as yet almost imperceptible to any but the trained observer i saw that paul wished her to be well dressed but also that he suffered her to drive in a hired brougham and to have her door opened by the rawboned celt who had bumped down the dishes on his bachelor table the drawingroom curtains were renewed but this change served only to accentuate the enormities of the carpet and perhaps discouraged mrs ambrose from farther experiments at any rate the desecrating touch that halidon had affected to dread made no other inroads on the serried ugliness of the ambrose interior in the early summer when ned returned the ambroses had flown to europe again and the academy was still on paper well what do you make of her the traveller asked as we sat over our first dinner together too many things and they dont hang together perhaps shes still in the chrysalis stage has paul chucked the scheme altogether no he sent for me and we had a talk about it just before he sailed and what impression did you get that he had waited to send for me till just before he sailed oh there you go again i offered no denial and after a pause he asked did she ever talk to you about it yes once or twice in snatches well she thinks it all too beautiful she would like to see beauty put within the reach of everyone and the practical side she says she doesnt understand business halidon rose with a shrug very likely you frightened her with your ugly sardonic grin its not my fault if my smile doesnt add to the sumtotal of beauty well he said ignoring me next winter we shall see but the next winter did not bring ambrose back a brief line written in november from the italian lakes told me that he had a rotten cough and that the doctors were packing him off to egypt would i see the architects for him and explain to the trustees the academy already had trustees and all the rest of its official hierarchy and would they all excuse his not writing more than a word he was really too groggy but a little warm weather would set him up again and he would certainly come home in the spring he came home in the spring in the hold of the ship with his widow several decks above the funeral services were attended by all the officers of the academy and by two of the young fellows who had won the travelling scholarships and who shed tears of genuine grief when their benefactor was committed to the grave after that there was a pause of suspense and then the newspapers announced that the late paul ambrose had left his entire estate to his widow the board of the academy dissolved like a summer cloud and the secretary lighted his pipe for a year with the official paper of the stillborn institution after a decent lapse of time i called at the house in seventeenth street and found a man attaching a realestate agents sign to the window and a vanload of luggage backing away from the door the caretaker told me that mrs ambrose was sailing the next morning not long afterward i saw the library table with the helmeted knights standing before an auctioneers door in university place and i looked with a pang at the familiar inkstains in which i had so often traced the geography of pauls visionary world halidon who had picked up another job in the orient wrote me an elegiac letter on pauls death ending with and what about the academy and for all answer i sent him a newspaper clipping recording the terms of the will and another announcing the sale of the house and mrs ambroses departure for europe though ned and i corresponded with tolerable regularity i received no direct answer to this communication till about eighteen months later when he surprised me by a letter dated from florence it began though she tells me you have never understood her and when i had reached that point i laid it down and stared out of my office window at the chimneypots and the dirty snow on the roof ned halidon and pauls wife i murmured and incongruously enough my next thought was i wish id bought the library table that day the letter went on with waxing eloquence i could not stand the money if it were not that to her as well as to me it represents the sacred opportunity of at last giving speech to his inarticulateness oh damn it theyre too glib i muttered dashing the letter down then controlling my unreasoning resentment i read on you remember old man those words of his that you repeated to me three or four years ago ive half a mind to leave my money in trust to ned well it has come to me in trust as if in mysterious fulfillment of his thought and oh dear chap i dashed the letter down again and plunged into my work iii wont you own yourself a beast dear boy halidon asked me gently one afternoon of the following spring i had escaped for a six weeks holiday and was lying outstretched beside him in a willow chair on the terrace of their villa above florence my eyes turned from the happy vale at our feet to the illuminated face beside me a little way off at the other end of the terrace mrs halidon was bending over a pot of carnations on the balustrade oh cheerfully i assented you see he continued glowing living here costs us next to nothing and it was quite her idea our founding that fourth scholarship in memory of paul i had already heard of the fourth scholarship but i may have betrayed my surprise at the plural pronoun for the blood rose under neds sensitive skin and he said with an embarrassed laugh ah she so completely makes me forget that its not mine too well the great thing is that you both think of it chiefly as his oh chiefly altogether i should be no more than a wretched parasite if i didnt live first of all for that mrs halidon had turned and was advancing toward us with the slow step of leisurely enjoyment the bud of her beauty had at last unfolded her vague enigmatical gaze had given way to the clear look of the woman whose hand is on the clue of life shes not living for anything but her own happiness i mused and why in heavens name should she but ned my wife halidon continued his eyes following mine my wife feels it too even more strongly you know a womans sensitiveness shes theres nothing she wouldnt do for his memory because in other ways you understand he added lowering his tone as she drew nearer that as soon as the child is born we mean to go home for good and take up his work pauls work mrs halidon recovered slowly after the birth of her child the return to america was deferred for six months and then again for a whole year i heard of the halidons as established first at biarritz then in rome the second summer ned wrote me a line from st moritz he said the place agreed so well with his wife who was still delicate that they were thinking of building a house there a mere cleft in the rocks to hide our happiness in when it becomes too exuberant and the rest of the letter very properly was filled with a rhapsody upon his little daughter he spoke of her as paula the following year the halidons reappeared in new york and i heard with surprise that they had taken the brereton house for the winter well why not i argued with myself after all the money is hers as far as i know the will didnt even hint at a restriction why should i expect a pretty woman with two children for now there was an heir to spend her fortune on a visionary scheme that its originator hadnt the heart to carry out yes cried the devils advocate but ned my first impression of halidon was that he had thickened thickened all through he was heavier physically with the ruddiness of good living rather than of hard training he spoke more deliberately and had less frequent bursts of subversive enthusiasm well he was a father a householder yes and a capitalist now it was fitting that his manner should show a sense of these responsibilities as for mrs halidon it was evident that the only responsibilities she was conscious of were those of the handsome woman and the accomplished hostess she was handsomer than ever with her two babies at her knee perfect mother as she was perfect wife poor paul i wonder if he ever dreamed what a flower was hidden in the folded bud not long after their arrival i dined alone with the halidons and lingered on to smoke with ned while his wife went alone to the opera he seemed dull and out of sorts and complained of a twinge of gout fact is i dont get enough exercise i must look about for a horse he had gone afoot for a good many years and kept his clear skin and quick eye on that homely regimen but i had to remind myself that after all we were both older and also that the halidons had champagne every evening how do you like these cigars theyre some ive just got out from london but im not quite satisfied with them myself he grumbled pushing toward me the silver box and its attendant taper i leaned to the flame and our eyes met as i lit my cigar ned flushed and laughed uneasily poor paul were you thinking of those execrable weeds of his i wonder how i knew you were probably because i have been wanting to talk to you of our plan i sent daisy off alone so that we might have a quiet evening not that she isnt interested only the technical details bore her i hesitated are there many technical details left to settle halidon pushed his armchair back from the firelight and twirled his cigar between his fingers i didnt suppose there were till i began to look into things a little more closely you know i never had much of a head for business and it was chiefly with you that paul used to go over the figures the figures there it is you see he paused have you any idea how much this thing is going to cost approximately yes and have you any idea how much we how much daisys fortune amounts to none whatever i hastened to assert he looked relieved well we simply cant do it and live live paul didnt live he said impatiently i cant ask a woman with two children to think of hang it shes under no actual obligation he rose and began to walk the floor presently he paused and halted in front of me defensively as paul had once done years before its not that ive lost the sense of my obligation it grows keener with the growth of my happiness but my positions a delicate one ah my dear fellow you do see it i knew you would yes he was duller thats the point i cant strip my wife and children to carry out a plan a plan so nebulous that even its inventor the long and short of it is that the whole scheme must be restudied reorganized paul lived in a world of dreams i rose and tossed my cigar into the fire there were some things he never dreamed of i said halidon rose too facing me uneasily you mean that you would taunt him with not having spent that money he pulled himself up with darkening brows then the muscles of his forehead relaxed a flush suffused it and he held out his hand in boyish penitence i stand a good deal from you he said he kept up his idea of going over the academy question threshing it out once for all as he expressed it but my suggestion that we should provisionally resuscitate the extinct board did not meet with his approval not till the whole business is settled i shouldnt have the face wait till i can go to them and say were laying the foundationstone on such a day we had one or two conferences and ned speedily lost himself in a maze of figures his nimble fancy was recalcitrant to mental discipline and he excused his inattention with the plea that he had no head for business all i know is that its a colossal undertaking and that short of living on bread and water and then we turned anew to the hard problem of retrenchment at the close of the second conference we fixed a date for a third when neds business adviser was to be called in but before the day came i learned casually that the halidons had gone south some weeks later ned wrote me from florida apologizing for his remissness they had rushed off suddenly his wife had a cough he explained when they returned in the spring i heard that they had bought the brereton house for what seemed to my inexperienced ears a very large sum but ned whom i met one day at the club explained to me convincingly that it was really the most economical thing they could do you dont understand about such things dear boy living in your diogenes tub but wait till theres a mrs diogenes i can assure you its a lot cheaper than building which is what daisy would have preferred and of course he added his color rising as our eyes met of course once the academys going i shall have to make my headquarters here and i suppose even you wont grudge me a roof over my head the brereton roof was a vast one with a marble balustrade about it and i could quite understand without neds halting explanation that under the circumstances it would be necessary to defer what he called our work of course after weve rallied from this amputation we shall grow fresh supplies i mean my wifes investments will he laughingly corrected and then well have no big outlays ahead and shall know exactly where we stand after all my dear fellow charity begins at home iv the halidons floated off to europe for the summer in due course their return was announced in the social chronicle and walking up fifth avenue one afternoon i saw the back of the brereton house sheathed in scaffolding and realized that they were adding a wing i did not look up halidon nor did i hear from him till the middle of the winter once or twice meanwhile i had seen him in the back of his wifes opera box but mrs halidon had grown so resplendent that she reduced her handsome husband to a supernumerary in january the papers began to talk of the halidon ball and in due course i received a card for it i was not a frequenter of balls and had no intention of going to this one but when the day came some obscure impulse moved me to set aside my rule and toward midnight i presented myself at neds illuminated portals i shall never forget his look when i accosted him on the threshold of the big new ballroom with celibate egoism i had rather fancied he would be gratified by my departure from custom but one glance showed me my mistake he smiled warmly indeed and threw into his handclasp an artificial energy of welcome you of all people my dear fellow have you seen daisy but the look behind the smile made me feel cold in the crowded room nor was mrs halidons greeting calculated to restore my circulation have you come to spy on us her frosty smile seemed to say and i crept home early wondering if she had not found me out it was the following week that halidon turned up one day in my office he looked pale and thinner and for the first time i noticed a dash of gray in his hair i was startled at the change in him but i reflected that it was nearly a year since we had looked at each other by daylight and that my shavingglass had doubtless a similar tale to tell he fidgeted about the office told me a funny story about his little boy and then dropped into a chair look here he said i want to go into business business i stared well why not i suppose men have gone to work even at my age and not made a complete failure of it the fact is i want to make some money he paused and added ive heard of an opportunity to pick up for next to nothing a site for the academy and if i could lay my hands on a little cash do you want to speculate i interposed heaven forbid but dont you see that if i had a fixed job so much a quarter i could borrow the money and pay it off gradually i meditated upon this astounding proposition do you really think its wise to buy a site before before what well seeing ahead a little his face fell for a moment but he rejoined cheerfully its an exceptional chance and after all i shall see ahead if i can get regular work i can put by a little every month and by and bye when our living expenses diminish my wife means to come forward her idea would be to give the building he broke off and drummed on the table waiting nervously for me to speak he did not say on what grounds he still counted on a diminution of his household expenses and i had not the cruelty to press this point but i murmured after a moment i think youre right i should try to buy the land we discussed his potentialities for work which were obviously still an unknown quantity and the conference ended in my sending him to a firm of realestate brokers who were looking out for a partner with a little money to invest halidon had a few thousands of his own which he decided to embark in the venture and thereafter for the remaining months of the winter he appeared punctually at a desk in the brokers office and sketched plans of the academy on the back of their business paper the site for the future building had meanwhile been bought and i rather deplored the publicity which ned gave to the fact but after all since this publicity served to commit him more deeply to pledge him conspicuously to the completion of his task it was perhaps a wise instinct of selfcoercion that had prompted him it was a dull winter in realty and toward spring when the market began to revive one of the halidon children showed symptoms of a delicate throat and the fashionable doctor who humoured the family ailments counselled nay commanded a prompt flight to the mediterranean he says a new york spring would be simply criminal and as for those ghastly southern places my wife wont hear of them so were off but i shall be back in july and i mean to stick to the office all summer he was true to his word and reappeared just as all his friends were deserting town for two torrid months he sat at his desk drawing fresh plans of the academy and waiting for the windfall of a big deal but in september he broke down from the effect of the unwonted confinement and his indignant wife swept him off to the mountains why ned should work when we have the money i wish he would sell that wretched piece of land and sell it he did one day i chanced on a record of the transaction in the realty column of the morning paper he afterward explained the sale to me at length owing to some spasmodic effort at municipal improvement there had been an unforeseen rise in the adjoining property and it would have been foolish yes i agreed that it would have been foolish he had made on the sale and that would go toward paying off what he had borrowed for the original purchase meanwhile he could be looking about for another site later in the winter he told me it was a bad time to look his position in the realestate business enabled him to follow the trend of the market and that trend was obstinately upward but of course there would be a reaction and he was keeping his eyes open as the resuscitated academy scheme once more fell into abeyance i saw halidon less and less frequently and we had not met for several months when one day of june my morning paper startled me with the announcement that the president had appointed edward halidon of new york to be civil commissioner of our newly acquired eastern possession the manana islands the unhealthy climate of the islands and the defective sanitation of the towns make it necessary that vigorous measures should be taken to protect the health of the american citizens established there and it is believed that mr halidons large experience of eastern life and wellknown energy of character i read the paragraph twice then i dropped the paper and projected myself through the subway to halidons office but he was not there he had not been there for a month one of the clerks believed he was in washington its true then i said to myself but mrs halidon in the mananas a day or two later ned appeared in my office he looked better than when we had last met and there was a determined line about his lips my wife heaven forbid you dont suppose i should think of taking her but the job is a tremendously interesting one and its the kind of work i believe i can do the only kind he added smiling rather ruefully but my dear ned he faced me with a look of quiet resolution i think ive been through all the buts its an infernal climate of course but then i am used to the east i know what precautions to take and it would be a big thing to clean up that augean stable but consider your wife and children he met this with deliberation i have considered my children thats the point i dont want them to be able to say when they look back he was content to go on living on that money my dear ned thats the one thing they shant say of me he pressed on vehemently ive tried other ways but im no good at business i see now that i shall never make money enough to carry out the scheme myself but at least i can clear out and not go on being his pensioner seeing his dreams turned into horses and carpets and clothes he broke off and leaning on my desk hid his face in his hands when he looked up again his flush of wrath had subsided just understand me its not her fault dont fancy im trying for an instant to shift the blame a woman with children simply obeys the instinct of her sex she puts them first and i wouldnt have it otherwise as far as shes concerned there were no conditions attached theres no reason why she should make any sacrifice he paused and added painfully the trouble is i cant make her see that i am differently situated but ned the climate what are you going to gain by chucking yourself away he lifted his brows thats a queer argument from you and besides im up to the tricks of all those agueholes and ive got to live you see ive got something to put through he saw my look of enquiry and added with a shy poignant laugh how i hear it still i dont mean only the job in hand though thats enough in itself but pauls work you understand it wont come in my day of course ive got to accept that but my boys a splendid chap the boy was three and i tell you what it is old man i believe when he grows up hell put it through halidon went to the mananas and for two years the journals brought me incidental reports of the work he was accomplishing he certainly had found a job to his hand official words of commendation rang through the country and there were lengthy newspaper leaders on the efficiency with which our representative was prosecuting his task in that lost corner of our colonies then one day a brief paragraph announced his death one of the last victims of the pestilence he had so successfully combated that evening at my club i heard men talking of him one said whats the use of a fellow wasting himself on a lot of savages and another wiseacre opined oh he went off because there was friction at home a fellow like that who knew the east would have got through all right if hed taken the proper precautions i saw him before he left and i never saw a man look less as if he wanted to live i turned on the last speaker and my voice made him drop his lighted cigar on his complacent knuckles i never knew a man i exclaimed who had better reasons for wanting to live a handsome youth mused yes his wife is very beautiful but it doesnt follow and then some one nudged him for they knew i was halidons friend the pretext i mrs ransom when the front door had closed on her visitor passed with a spring from the drawingroom to the narrow hall and thence up the narrow stairs to her bedroom though slender and still light of foot she did not always move so quickly hitherto in her life there had not been much to hurry for save the recurring domestic tasks that compel haste without fostering elasticity but some impetus of youth revived communicated to her by her talk with guy dawnish now found expression in her girlish flight upstairs her girlish impatience to bolt herself into her room with her throbs and her blushes her blushes was she really blushing she approached the cramped eagletopped mirror above her plain prim dressingtable just such a meagre concession to the weakness of the flesh as every oldfashioned house in wentworth counted among its relics the face reflected in this unflattering surface for even the mirrors of wentworth erred on the side of depreciation did not seem at first sight a suitable theatre for the display of the tenderer emotions and its owner blushed more deeply as the fact was forced upon her her fair hair had grown too thin it no longer quite hid the blue veins in her candid forehead a forehead that one seemed to see turned toward professorial desks in large bare halls where a snowy winter light fell uncompromisingly on rows of thoughtful women her mouth was thin too and a little strained her lips were too pale and there were lines in the corners of her eyes it was a face which had grown middleaged while it waited for the joys of youth well but if she could still blush instinctively she drew back a little so that her scrutiny became less microscopic and the pretty lingering pink threw a veil over her pallor the hollows in her temples the faint wrinkles of inexperience about her lips and eyes how a little colour helped it made her eyes so deep and shining she saw now why bad women rouged her redness deepened at the thought but suddenly she noticed for the first time that the collar of her dress was cut too low it showed the shrunken lines of the throat she rummaged feverishly in a tidy scentless drawer and snatching out a bit of black velvet bound it about her neck yes that was better it gave her the relief she needed relief contrast that was it she had never had any either in her appearance or in her setting she was as flat as the pattern of the wallpaper and so was her life and all the people about her had the same look wentworth was the kind of place where husbands and wives gradually grew to resemble each other one or two of her friends she remembered had told her lately that she and ransom were beginning to look alike but why had she always so tamely allowed her aspect to conform to her situation perhaps a gayer exterior would have provoked a brighter fate even now she turned back to the glass loosened the tight strands of hair above her brow ran the fine end of the comb under them with a rapid frizzing motion and then disposed them more lightly and amply above her eager face yes it was really better it made a difference she smiled at herself with a timid coquetry and her lips seemed rosier as she smiled then she laid down the comb and the smile faded it made a difference certainly but was it right to try to make ones hair look thicker and wavier than it really was between that and rouging the ethical line seemed almost impalpable and the spectre of her rigid new england ancestry rose reprovingly before her she was sure that none of her grandmothers had ever simulated a curl or encouraged a blush a blush indeed what had any of them ever had to blush for in all their frozen lives and what in heavens name had she she sat down in the stiff mahogany rockingchair beside her worktable and tried to collect herself from childhood she had been taught to collect herself but never before had her small sensations and aspirations been so widely scattered diffused over so vague and uncharted an expanse hitherto they had lain in neatly sorted and easily accessible bundles on the high shelves of a perfectly ordered moral consciousness and now now that for the first time they needed collecting now that the little winged and scattered bits of self were dancing madly down the vagrant winds of fancy she knew no spell to call them to the fold again the best way no doubt if only her bewilderment permitted was to go back to the beginning the beginning at least of todays visit to recapitulate word for word and look for look she clasped her hands on the arms of the chair checked its swaying with a firm thrust of her foot and fixed her eyes upon the inward vision to begin with what had made todays visit so different from the others it became suddenly vivid to her that there had been many almost daily others since guy dawnishs coming to wentworth even the previous winter the winter of his arrival from england his visits had been numerous enough to make wentworth aware that very naturally mrs ransom was looking after the stray young englishman committed to her husbands care by an eminent q c whom the ransoms had known on one of their brief london visits and with whom ransom had since maintained professional relations all this was in the natural order of things as sanctioned by the social code of wentworth every one was kind to guy dawnish some rather importunately so as margaret ransom had smiled to observe but it was recognized as fitting that she should be kindest since he was in a sense her property since his people in england by profusely acknowledging her kindness had given it the domestic sanction without which to wentworth any social relation between the sexes remained unhallowed and to be viewed askance yes and even this second winter when the visits had become so much more frequent so admitted a part of the days routine there had not been from any one a hint of surprise or of conjecture mrs ransom smiled with a faint bitterness she was protected by her age no doubt her age and her past and the image her mirror gave back to her her doorhandle turned suddenly and the bolts resistance was met by an impatient knock margaret she started up her brightness fading and unbolted the door to admit her husband why are you locked in why youre not dressed yet he exclaimed it was possible for ransom to reach his dressingroom by a slight circuit through the passage but it was characteristic of the relentless domesticity of their relation that he chose as a matter of course the directer way through his wifes bedroom she had never before been disturbed by this practice which she accepted as inevitable but had merely adapted her own habits to it delaying her hasty toilet till he was safely in his room or completing it before she heard his step on the stair since a scrupulous traditional prudery had miraculously survived this massacre of all the privacies oh i shant dress this evening i shall just have some tea in the library after youve gone she answered absently your things are laid out she added rousing herself he looked surprised the dinners at seven i suppose the speeches will begin at nine i thought you were coming to hear them she wavered i dont know i think not mrs sperrys ill and ive no one else to go with he glanced at his watch why not get hold of dawnish wasnt he here just now why didnt you ask him she turned toward her dressingtable and straightened the comb and brush with a nervous hand her husband had given her that morning two tickets for the ladies gallery in hamblin hall where the great public dinner of the evening was to take place a banquet offered by the faculty of wentworth to visitors of academic eminence and she had meant to ask dawnish to go with her it had seemed the most natural thing to do till the end of his visit came and then after all she had not spoken its too late now she murmured bending over her pin cushion too late not if you telephone him her husband came toward her and she turned quickly to face him lest he should suspect her of trying to avoid his eye to what duplicity was she already committed ransom laid a friendly hand on her arm come along margaret you know i speak for the bar she was aware in his voice of a little note of surprise at his having to remind her of this oh yes i meant to go of course well then he opened his dressingroom door and caught a glimpse of the retreating housemaids skirt heres maria now maria call up mr dawnish at mrs creswells you know tell him mrs ransom wants him to go with her to hear the speeches this evening the speeches you understand and hes to call for her at a quarter before nine margaret heard the irish yessir on the stairs and stood motionless while her husband added loudly and bring me some towels when you come up then he turned back into his wifes room why it would be a thousand pities for guy to miss this hes so interested in the way we do things over here and i dont know that hes ever heard me speak in public again the slight note of fatuity was it possible that ransom was a fatuous man he paused in front of her his shortsighted unobservant glance concentrating itself unexpectedly on her face youre not going like that are you he asked with glaring eyeglasses like what she faltered lifting a conscious hand to the velvet at her throat with your hair in such a fearful mess have you been shampooing it you look like the brant girl at the end of a tennismatch the brant girl was their horror the horror of all rightthinking wentworth a laced whaleboned frizzleheaded highheeled daughter of iniquity who came from new york of course on long disturbing tumultuous visits to a wentworth aunt working havoc among the freshmen and leaving when she departed an angry wake of criticism that ruffled the social waters for weeks she too had tried her hand at guy with ludicrous unsuccess and now to be compared to her to be accused of looking new yorky ah there are times when husbands are obtuse and ransom as he stood there thick and yet juiceless in his dry legal middle age with his wiry dustcoloured beard and his perpetual pincenez seemed to his wife a sudden embodiment of this traditional attribute not that she had ever fancied herself poor soul a femme incomprise she had on the contrary prided herself on being understood by her husband almost as much as on her own complete comprehension of him wentworth laid a good deal of stress on motives and margaret ransom and her husband had dwelt in a complete community of motive it had been the proudest day of her life when without consulting her he had refused an offer of partnership in an eminent new york firm because he preferred the distinction of practising in wentworth of being known as the legal representative of the university wentworth in fact had always been the bond between the two they were united in their veneration for that estimable seat of learning and in their modest yet vivid consciousness of possessing its tone the wentworth tone is unmistakable it permeates every part of the social economy from the coiffure of the ladies to the preparation of the food it has its sumptuary laws as well as its curriculum of learning it sits in judgment not only on its own townsmen but on the rest of the world enlightening criticising ostracizing a heedless universe and nonconformity to wentworth standards involves obliteration from wentworths consciousness in a world without traditions without reverence without stability such little expiring centres of prejudice and precedent make an irresistible appeal to those instincts for which a democracy has neglected to provide wentworth with its tone its backward references its inflexible aversions and condemnations its hard moral outline preserved intact against a whirling background of experiment had been all the poetry and history of margaret ransoms life yes what she had really esteemed in her husband was the fact of his being so intense an embodiment of wentworth so long and closely identified for instance with its legal affairs that he was almost a part of its university existence that of course at a college banquet he would inevitably speak for the bar it was wonderful of how much consequence all this had seemed till now ii when punctually at ten minutes to seven her husband had emerged from the house margaret ransom remained seated in her bedroom addressing herself anew to the difficult process of selfcollection as an aid to this endeavour she bent forward and looked out of the window following ransoms figure as it receded down the elmshaded street he moved almost alone between the prim flowerless grassplots the white porches the protrusion of irrelevant shingled gables which stamped the empty street as part of an american college town she had always been proud of living in hill street where the university people congregated proud to associate her husbands retreating back as he walked daily to his office with backs literary and pedagogic backs of which it was whispered for the edification of dulyimpressed visitors wait till that old boy turns thats soandso this had been her world a world destitute of personal experience but filled with a rich sense of privilege and distinction of being not as those millions were who denied the inestimable advantage of living at wentworth pursued elsewhere careers foredoomed to futility by that very fact and now she rose and turned to her worktable where she had dropped on entering the handful of photographs that guy dawnish had left with her while he sat so close pointing out and explaining she had hardly taken in the details but now on the full tones of his low young voice they came back with redoubled distinctness this was guise abbey his uncles place in wiltshire where under his grandfathers rule guys own boyhood had been spent a long gabled jacobean facade manychimneyed ivydraped overhung she felt sure by the boughs of a venerable rookery and in this other picture the walled garden at guise that was his uncle lord askern a hale goutylooking figure planted robustly on the terrace a gun on his shoulder and a couple of setters at his feet and here was the river below the park with guy punting a girl in a flapping hat how margaret hated the flap that hid the girls face and here was the tenniscourt with guy among a jolly crosslegged group of youths in flannels and pretty girls about the teatable under the big lime in the centre the curate handing bread and butter and in the middle distance a footman approaching with more cups margaret raised this picture closer to her eyes puzzling in the diminished light over the face of the girl nearest to guy dawnish bent above him in profile while he laughingly lifted his head no hat hid this profile which stood out clearly against the foliage behind it and who is that handsome girl margaret had said detaining the photograph as he pushed it aside and struck by the fact that of the whole group he had left only this member unnamed oh only gwendolen matcher ive always known her look at this the almshouses at guise arent they jolly and then without her having had the courage to ask if the girl in the punt were also gwendolen matcher they passed on to photographs of his rooms at oxford of a cousins studio in london one of lord askerns grandsons was artistic of the rosehung cottage in wales to which on the old earls death his daughterinlaw guys mother had retired every one of the photographs opened a window on the life margaret had been trying to picture since she had known him a life so rich so romantic so packed in the mere casual vocabulary of daily life with historic reference and poetic allusion that she felt almost oppressed by this distant whiff of its air the very words he used fascinated and bewildered her he seemed to have been born into all sorts of connections political historical official that made the ransom situation at wentworth as featureless as the top shelf of a dark closet some one in the family had asked for the chiltern hundreds one uncle was an elder brother of the trinity house some one else was the master of a college some one was in command at devonport the army the navy the house of commons the house of lords the most venerable seats of learning were all woven into the dense background of this young mans light unconscious talk for the unconsciousness was unmistakable margaret was not without experience of the transatlantic visitor who sounds loud names and evokes reverberating connections the poetry of guy dawnishs situation lay in the fact that it was so completely a part of early associations and accepted facts life was like that in england in wentworth of course where he had been sent through his uncles influence for two years training in the neighbouring electrical works at smedden in wentworth though immensely jolly it was different the fact that he was qualifying to be an electrical engineer with the hope of a secretaryship at the london end of the great smedden company that at best he was returning home to a life of industrial grind this fact though avowedly a bore did not disconnect him from that brilliant pinnacled past that manyfaceted life in which the brightest episodes of the whole body of english fiction seemed collectively reflected of course he would have to work younger sons sons almost always had to but his uncle askern like wentworth was immensely jolly and guise always open to him and his other uncle the master a capital old boy too and in town he could always put up with his clever aunt lady caroline duckett who had made a beastly marriage and was horribly poor but who knew everybody jolly and amusing and had always been particularly kind to him it was not and margaret had not even in her own thoughts to defend herself from the imputation it was not what wentworth would have called the material side of her friends situation that captivated her she was austerely proof against such appeals her enthusiasms were all of the imaginative order what subjugated her was the unexampled prodigality with which he poured for her the same draught of tradition of which wentworth held out its little teacupful he besieged her with a million wentworths in one saying as it were all these are mine for the asking and i choose you instead for this she told herself somewhat dizzily was what it came to the summingup toward which her conscientious efforts at selfcollection had been gradually pushing her with all this in reach guy dawnish was leaving wentworth reluctantly i was a bit lonely here at first but now and again it will be jolly of course to see them all again but there are some things one doesnt easily give up if he had known only wentworth it would have been wonderful enough that he should have chosen her out of all wentworth but to have known that other life and to set her in the balance against it poor margaret ransom in whom at the moment nothing seemed of weight but her years ah it might well produce in nerves and brain and poor unpractised pulses a flushed tumult of sensation the rush of a great wave of life under which memory struggled in vain to reassert itself to particularize again just what his last words the very last had been when consciousness emerged quivering from this retrospective assault it pushed margaret ransom feeling herself a mere leaf in the blast toward the writingtable from which her innocent and voluminous correspondence habitually flowed she had a letter to write now much shorter but more difficult than any she had ever been called on to indite dear mr dawnish she began since telephoning you just now i have decided not marias voice at the door announced that tea was in the library and i spose its the brown silk youll wear to the speaking in the usual order of the ransom existence its mistresss toilet was performed unassisted and the mere enquiry at once friendly and deferential projected for margaret a strong light on the importance of the occasion that she should answer but i am not going when the going was so manifestly part of a household solemnity about which the thoughts below stairs fluttered in proud participation that in face of such participation she should utter a word implying indifference or hesitation nay revealing herself the transposed uprooted thing she had been on the verge of becoming to do this was well infinitely harder than to perform the alternative act of tearing up the sheet of notepaper under her reluctant pen yes she said she would wear the brown silk iii all the heat and glare from the long illuminated table about which the fumes of many courses still hung in a savoury fog seemed to surge up to the ladies gallery and concentrate themselves in the burning cheeks of a slender figure withdrawn behind the projection of a pillar it never occurred to margaret ransom that she was sitting in the shade she supposed that the full light of the chandeliers was beating on her face and there were moments when it seemed as though all the heads about the great horseshoe below bald shaggy sleek closethatched or thinly latticed were equipped with an additional pair of eyes set at an angle which enabled them to rake her face as relentlessly as the electric burners in the lull after a speech the gallery was fluttering with the rustle of programmes consulted and mrs sheff the brant girls aunt leaned forward to say enthusiastically and now were to hear mr ransom a louder buzz rose from the table and the heads without relaxing their upward vigilance seemed to merge and flow together like an attentive flood toward the upper end of the horseshoe where all the threads of margaret ransoms consciousness were suddenly drawn into what seemed a small speck no more a black speck that rose hung in air dissolved into gyrating gestures became distended enormous preponderant became her husband speaking its the heat margaret gasped pressing her handkerchief to her whitening lips and finding just strength enough left to push back farther into the shadow she felt a touch on her arm it is horrible shall we go a voice suggested and yes yes let us go she whispered feeling with a great throb of relief that to be the only possible the only conceivable solution to sit and listen to her husband now how could she ever have thought she could survive it luckily under the lingering hubbub from below his opening words were inaudible and she had only to run the gauntlet of sympathetic feminine glances shot after her between waving fans and programmes as guided by guy dawnish she managed to reach the door it was really so hot that even mrs sheff was not much surprised till long afterward the winding staircase was empty half dark and blessedly silent in a committee room below dawnish found the inevitable water jug and filled a glass for her while she leaned back confronted only by a frowning college president in an emblazoned frame the academic frown descended on her like an anathema when she rose and followed her companion out of the building hamblin hall stands at the end of the long green campus with its sextuple line of elms the boast and the singularity of wentworth a pale spring moon rising above the dome of the university library at the opposite end of the elmwalk diffused a pearly mildness in the sky melted to thin haze the shadows of the trees and turned to golden yellow the lights of the college windows against this soft suffusion of light the library cupola assumed a bramantesque grace the white steeple of the congregational church became a campanile topped by a winged spirit and the scant porticoes of the older halls the colonnades of classic temples this is better dawnish said as they passed down the steps and under the shadow of the elms they moved on a little way in silence before he began again youre too tired to walk let us sit down a few minutes her feet in truth were leaden and not far off a group of park benches encircling the pedestal of a patriot in bronze invited them to rest but dawnish was guiding her toward a lateral path which bent through shrubberies toward a strip of turf between two of the buildings it will be cooler by the river he said moving on without waiting for a possible protest none came it seemed easier for the moment to let herself be led without any conventional feint of resistance and besides there was nothing wrong about this the wrong would have been in sitting up there in the glare pretending to listen to her husband a dutiful wife among her kind the path descended as both knew to the chosen the inimitable spot of wentworth that fugitive curve of the river where before hurrying on to glut the brutal industries of south wentworth and smedden it simulated for a few hundred yards the leisurely pace of an ancient university stream with willows on its banks and a stretch of turf extending from the grounds of hamblin hall to the boat houses at the farther bend here too were benches beneath the willows and so close to the river that the voice of its gliding softened and filled out the reverberating silence between margaret and her companion and made her feel that she knew why he had brought her there do you feel better he asked gently as he sat down beside her oh yes i only needed a little air im so glad you did of course the speeches were tremendously interesting but i prefer this what a good night yes there was a pause which now after all the soothing accompaniment of the river seemed hardly sufficient to fill i wonder what time it is i ought to be going home margaret began at length oh its not late theyll be at it for hours in there yet she made a faint inarticulate sound she wanted to say no roberts speech was to be the last but she could not bring herself to pronounce ransoms name and at the moment no other way of refuting her companions statement occurred to her the young man leaned back luxuriously reassured by her silence you see its my last chance and i want to make the most of it your last chance how stupid of her to repeat his words on that cooing note of interrogation it was just such a lead as the brant girl might have given him to be with you like this i havent had so many and theres less than a week left she attempted to laugh perhaps it will sound longer if you call it five days the flatness of that again and she knew there were people who called her intelligent fortunately he did not seem to notice it but her laugh continued to sound in her own ears the coquettish chirp of middle age she decided that if he spoke again if he said anything she would make no farther effort at evasion she would take it directly seriously frankly she would not be doubly disloyal besides he continued throwing his arm along the back of the bench and turning toward her so that his face was like a dusky basrelief with a silver rim besides theres something ive been wanting to tell you the sound of the river seemed to cease altogether the whole world became silent margaret had trusted her inspiration farther than it appeared likely to carry her again she could think of nothing happier than to repeat on the same witless note of interrogation to tell me you only the constraint the difficulty seemed to be on his side now she divined it by the renewed shifting of his attitude he was capable usually of such fine intervals of immobility and by a confusion in his utterance that set her own voice throbbing in her throat youve been so perfect to me he began again its not my fault if youve made me feel that you would understand everything make allowances for everything see just how a man may have held out and fought against a thing as long as he had the strength this may be my only chance and i cant go away without telling you he had turned from her now and was staring at the river so that his profile was projected against the moonlight in all its beautiful young dejection there was a slight pause as though he waited for her to speak then she leaned forward and laid her hand on his if i have really been if i have done for you even the least part of what you say what you imagine will you do for me now just one thing in return he sat motionless as if fearing to frighten away the shy touch on his hand and she left it there conscious of her gesture only as part of the high ritual of their farewell what do you want me to do he asked in a low tone not to tell me she breathed on a deep note of entreaty not to tell you anything anything just to leave our our friendship as it has been as as a painter if a friend asked him might leave a picture not quite finished perhaps but all the more exquisite she felt the hand under hers slip away recover itself and seek her own which had flashed out of reach in the same instant felt the start that swept him round on her as if he had been caught and turned about by the shoulders you you he stammered in a strange voice full of fear and tenderness but she held fast so centred in her inexorable resolve that she was hardly conscious of the effect her words might be producing dont you see she hurried on dont you feel how much safer it is yes im willing to put it so how much safer to leave everything undisturbed just as as it has grown of itself without trying to say its this or that its what we each choose to call it to ourselves after all isnt it dont let us try to find a name that that we should both agree upon we probably shouldnt succeed she laughed abruptly and ghosts vanish when one names them she ended with a break in her voice when she ceased her heart was beating so violently that there was a rush in her ears like the noise of the river after rain and she did not immediately make out what he was answering but as she recovered her lucidity she said to herself that whatever he was saying she must not hear it and she began to speak again half playfully half appealingly with an eloquence of entreaty an ingenuity in argument of which she had never dreamed herself capable and then suddenly strangling hands seemed to reach up from her heart to her throat and she had to stop her companion remained motionless he had not tried to regain her hand and his eyes were away from her on the river but his nearness had become something formidable and exquisite something she had never before imagined a flush of guilt swept over her vague reminiscences of french novels and of opera plots this was what such women felt then this was shame phrases of the newspaper and the pulpit danced before her she dared not speak and his silence began to frighten her had ever a heart beat so wildly before in wentworth he turned at last and taking her two hands quite simply kissed them one after the other i shall never forget he said in a confused voice unlike his own a return of strength enabled her to rise and even to let her eyes meet his for a moment thank you she said simply also she turned away from the bench regaining the path that led back to the college buildings and he walked beside her in silence when they reached the elm walk it was dotted with dispersing groups the speaking was over and hamblin hall had poured its audience out into the moonlight margaret felt a rush of relief followed by a receding wave of regret she had the distinct sensation that her hour her one hour was over one of the groups just ahead broke up as they approached and projected ransoms solid bulk against the moonlight my husband she said hastening forward and she never afterward forgot the look of his back heavy roundshouldered yet a little pompous in a badly fitting overcoat that stood out at the neck and hid his collar she had never before noticed how he dressed iv they met again inevitably before dawnish left but the thing she feared did not happen he did not try to see her alone it even became clear to her in looking back that he had deliberately avoided doing so and this seemed merely an added proof of his understanding of that deep undefinable communion that set them alone in an empty world as if on a peak above the clouds the five days passed in a flash and when the last one came it brought to margaret ransom an hour of weakness of profound disorganization when old barriers fell old convictions faded when to be alone with him for a moment became after all the one craving of her heart she knew he was coming that afternoon to say goodby and she knew also that ransom was to be away at south wentworth she waited alone in her pale little drawingroom with its scant kakemonos its one or two chilly reproductions from the antique its slippery chippendale chairs at length the bell rang and her world became a rosy blur through which she presently discerned the austere form of mrs sperry wife of the professor of palaeontology who had come to talk over with her the next winters programme for the higher thought club they debated the question for an hour and when mrs sperry departed margaret had a confused impression that the course was to deal with the influence of the first crusade on the development of european architecture but the sentient part of her knew only that dawnish had not come he bobbed in as he would have put it after dinner having it appeared run across ransom early in the day and learned that the latter would be absent till evening margaret was in the study with her husband when the door opened and dawnish stood there ransom who had not had time to dress was seated at his desk a pile of shabby law books at his elbow the light from a hanging lamp falling on his grayish stubble of hair his sallow forehead and spectacled eyes dawnish towering higher than usual against the shadows of the room and refined by his unusual pallor hung a moment on the threshold then came in explaining himself profusely laughing accepting a cigar letting ransom push an armchair forward a dawnish she had never seen ill at ease ejaculatory yet somehow more mature more obscurely in command of himself margaret drew back seating herself in the shade in such a way that she saw her husbands head first and beyond it their visitors relieved against the dusk of the book shelves her heart was still she felt no throbbing in her throat or temples all her life seemed concentrated in the hand that lay on her knee the hand he would touch when they said goodby afterward her heart rang all the changes and there was a mood in which she reproached herself for cowardice for having deliberately missed her one moment with him the moment in which she might have sounded the depths of life for joy or anguish but that mood was fleeting and infrequent in quieter hours she blushed for it she even trembled to think that he might have guessed such a regret in her it seemed to convict her of a lack of fineness that he should have had in his youth and his power a tenderer surer sense of the peril of a rash touch should have handled the case so much more delicately at first her days were fire and the nights long solemn vigils her thoughts were no longer vulgarized and defaced by any notion of guilt of mental disloyalty she was ashamed now of her shame what had happened was as much outside the sphere of her marriage as some transaction in a star it had simply given her a secret life of incommunicable joys as if all the wasted springs of her youth had been stored in some hidden pool and she could return there now to bathe in them after that there came a phase of loneliness through which the life about her loomed phantasmal and remote she thought the dead must feel thus repeating the vain gestures of the living beside some stygian shore she wondered if any other woman had lived to whom nothing had ever happened and then his first letter came it was a charming letter a perfect letter the little touch of awkwardness and constraint under its boyish spontaneity told her more than whole pages of eloquence he spoke of their friendship of their good days together ransom chancing to come in while she read noticed the foreign stamps and she was able to hand him the letter saying gaily theres a message for you and knowing all the while that her message was safe in her heart on the days when the letters came the outlines of things grew indistinct and she could never afterward remember what she had done or how the business of life had been carried on it was always a surprise when she found dinner on the table as usual and ransom seated opposite to her running over the evening paper but though dawnish continued to write with all the english loyalty to the outward observances of friendship his communications came only at intervals of several weeks and between them she had time to repossess herself to regain some sort of normal contact with life and the customary the recurring gradually reclaimed her the net of habit tightened again her daily life became real and her one momentary escape from it an exquisite illusion not that she ceased to believe in the miracle that had befallen her she still treasured the reality of her one moment beside the river what reason was there for doubting it she could hear the ring of truth in young dawnishs voice its not my fault if youve made me feel that you would understand everything no she believed in her miracle and the belief sweetened and illumined her life but she came to see that what was for her the transformation of her whole being might well have been for her companion a mere passing explosion of gratitude of boyish goodfellowship touched with the pang of leavetaking she even reached the point of telling herself that it was better so this view of the episode so defended it from the alternating extremes of selfreproach and derision so enshrined it in a pale immortality to which she could make her secret pilgrimages without reproach for a long time she had not been able to pass by the bench under the willows she even avoided the elm walk till autumn had stripped its branches but every day now she noted a step toward recovery and at last a day came when walking along the river she said to herself as she approached the bench i used not to be able to pass here without thinking of him and now i am not thinking of him at all this seemed such convincing proof of her recovery that she began as spring returned to permit herself now and then a quiet session on the bench a dedicated hour from which she went back fortified to her task she had not heard from her friend for six weeks or more the intervals between his letters were growing longer but that was best too and she was not anxious for she knew he had obtained the post he had been preparing for and that his active life in london had begun the thought reminded her one mild march day that in leaving the house she had thrust in her reticule a letter from a wentworth friend who was abroad on a holiday the envelope bore the london post mark a fact showing that the ladys face was turned toward home margaret seated herself on her bench and drawing out the letter began to read it the london described was that of shops and museums as remote as possible from the setting of guy dawnishs existence but suddenly margarets eye fell on his name and the page began to tremble in her hands i heard such a funny thing yesterday about your friend mr dawnish we went to a tea at professor bunces i do wish you knew the bunces their atmosphere is so uplifting and there i met that miss brucepringle who came out last year to take a course in histology at the annex of course she asked about you and mr ransom and then she told me she had just seen mr dawnishs aunt the clever one he was always talking about lady caroline something and that they were all in a dreadful state about him i wonder if you knew he was engaged when he went to america he never mentioned it to us she said it was not a positive engagement but an understanding with a girl he has always been devoted to who lives near their place in wiltshire and both families expected the marriage to take place as soon as he got back it seems the girl is an heiress you know how low the english ideals are compared with ours and miss brucepringle said his relations were perfectly delighted at his being provided for as she called it well when he got back he asked the girl to release him and she and her family were furious and so were his people but he holds out and wont marry her and wont give a reason except that he has formed an unfortunate attachment did you ever hear anything so peculiar his aunt who is quite wild about it says it must have happened at wentworth because he didnt go anywhere else in america do you suppose it could have been the brant girl but why unfortunate when everybody knows she would have jumped at him margaret folded the letter and looked out across the river it was not the same river but a mystic current shot with moonlight the bare willows wove a leafy veil above her head and beside her she felt the nearness of youth and tempestuous tenderness it had all happened just here on this very seat by the river it had come to her and passed her by and she had not held out a hand to detain it well was it not by that very abstention made more deeply and ineffaceably hers she could argue thus while she had thought the episode on his side a mere transient effect of propinquity but now that she knew it had altered the whole course of his life now that it took on substance and reality asserted a separate existence outside of her own troubled consciousness now it seemed almost cowardly to have missed her share in it she walked home in a dream now and then when she passed an acquaintance she wondered if the pain and glory were written on her face but mrs sperry who stopped her at the corner of maverick street to say a word about the next meeting of the higher thought club seemed to remark no change in her when she reached home ransom had not yet returned from the office and she went straight to the library to tidy his writingtable it was part of her daily duty to bring order out of the chaos of his papers and of late she had fastened on such small recurring tasks as some one falling over a precipice might snatch at the weak bushes in its clefts when she had sorted the letters she took up some pamphlets and newspapers glancing over them to see if they were to be kept among the papers was a page torn from a london times of the previous month her eye ran down its columns and suddenly a paragraph flamed out we are requested to state that the marriage arranged between mr guy dawnish son of the late colonel the hon roderick dawnish of malby wilts and gwendolen daughter of samuel matcher esq of armingham towers wilts will not take place margaret dropped the paper and sat down hiding her face against the stained baize of the desk she remembered the photograph of the tenniscourt at guise she remembered the handsome girl at whom guy dawnish looked up laughing a gust of tears shook her loosening the dry surface of conventional feeling welling up from unsuspected depths she was sorry very sorry yet so glad so ineffably impenitently glad v there came a reaction in which she decided to write to him she even sketched out a letter of sisterly almost motherly remonstrance in which she reminded him that he still had all his life before him but she reflected that so after all had she and that seemed to weaken the argument in the end she decided not to send the letter he had never spoken to her of his engagement to gwendolen matcher and his letters had contained no allusion to any sentimental disturbance in his life she had only his few broken words that night by the river on which to build her theory of the case but illuminated by the phrase an unfortunate attachment the theory towered up distinct and immovable like some high landmark by which travellers shape their course she had been loved extraordinarily loved but he had chosen that she should know of it by his silence rather than by his speech he had understood that only on those terms could their transcendant communion continue that he must lose her to keep her to break that silence would be like spilling a cup of water in a waste of sand there would be nothing left for her thirst her life thenceforward was bathed in a tranquil beauty the days flowed by like a river beneath the moon each ripple caught the brightness and passed it on she began to take a renewed interest in her familiar round of duties the tasks which had once seemed colourless and irksome had now a kind of sacrificial sweetness a symbolic meaning into which she alone was initiated she had been restless had longed to travel now she felt that she should never again care to leave wentworth but if her desire to wander had ceased she travelled in spirit performing invisible pilgrimages in the footsteps of her friend she regretted that her one short visit to england had taken her so little out of london that her acquaintance with the landscape had been formed chiefly through the windows of a railway carriage she threw herself into the architectural studies of the higher thought club and distinguished herself at the spring meetings by her fluency her competence her inexhaustible curiosity on the subject of the growth of english gothic she ransacked the shelves of the college library she borrowed photographs of the cathedrals she pored over the folio pages of the seats of noblemen and gentlemen she was like some banished princess who learns that she has inherited a domain in her own country who knows that she will never see it yet feels wherever she walks its soil beneath her feet may was half over and the higher thought club was to hold its last meeting previous to the college festivities which in early june agreeably disorganized the social routine of wentworth the meeting was to take place in margaret ransoms drawingroom and on the day before she sat upstairs preparing for her dual duties as hostess and orator for she had been invited to read the final paper of the course in order to sum up with precision her conclusions on the subject of english gothic she had been rereading an analysis of the structural features of the principal english cathedrals and she was murmuring over to herself the phrase the longitudinal arches of lincoln have an approximately elliptical form when there came a knock on the door and marias voice announced theres a lady down in the parlour margarets soul dropped from the heights of the shadowy vaulting to the dead level of an afternoon call at wentworth a lady did she give no name maria became confused she only said she was a lady and in reply to her mistresss look of mild surprise well maam she told me so three or four times over margaret laid her book down leaving it open at the description of lincoln and slowly descended the stairs as she did so she repeated to herself the longitudinal arches are elliptical on the threshold below she had the odd impression that her bare and inanimate drawingroom was brimming with life and noise an impression produced as she presently perceived by the resolute forward dash it was almost a pounce of the one small figure restlessly measuring its length the dash checked itself within a yard of margaret and the lady a stranger held back long enough to stamp on her hostess a sharp impression of sallowness leanness keenness before she said in a voice that might have been addressing an unruly committee meeting i am lady caroline duckett a fact i found it impossible to make clear to the young woman who let me in a warm wave rushed up from margarets heart to her throat and forehead she held out both hands impulsively oh im so glad id no idea her voice sank under her visitors impartial scrutiny i dont wonder said the latter drily i suppose she didnt mention either that my object in calling here was to see mrs ransom oh yes wont you sit down margaret pushed a chair forward she seated herself at a little distance brain and heart humming with a confused interchange of signals this dark sharp woman was his aunt the clever aunt who had had such a hard life but had always managed to keep her head above water margaret remembered that guy had spoken of her kindness perhaps she would seem kinder when they had talked together a little meanwhile the first impression she produced was of an amplitude out of all proportion to her somewhat scant exterior with her small flat figure her shabby heterogeneous dress she was as dowdy as any professors wife at wentworth but her dowdiness margaret borrowed a literary analogy to define it her dowdiness was somehow of the centre like the insignificant emissary of a great power she was to be judged rather by her passports than her person while margaret was receiving these impressions lady caroline with quick birdlike twists of her head was gathering others from the pale void spaces of the drawingroom her eyes divided by a sharp nose like a bill seemed to be set far enough apart to see at separate angles but suddenly she bent both of them on margaret this is mrs ransoms house she asked with an emphasis on the verb that gave a distinct hint of unfulfilled expectations margaret assented because your american houses especially in the provincial towns all look so remarkably alike that i thought i might have been mistaken and as my time is extremely limited in fact im sailing on wednesday she paused long enough to let margaret say i had no idea you were in this country lady caroline made no attempt to take this up and so much of it she carried on her sentence has been wasted in talking to people i really hadnt the slightest desire to see that you must excuse me if i go straight to the point margaret felt a sudden tension of the heart of course she said while a voice within her cried he is dead he has left me a message there was another pause then lady caroline went on with increasing asperity so that in short if i could see mrs ransom at once margaret looked up in surprise i am mrs ransom she said the other stared a moment with much the same look of cautious incredulity that had marked her inspection of the drawingroom then light came to her oh i beg your pardon i should have said that i wished to see mrs robert ransom not mrs ransom but i understood that in the states you dont make those distinctions she paused a moment and then went on before margaret could answer perhaps after all its as well that i should see you instead since youre evidently one of the household your son and his wife live with you i suppose yes on the whole then its better i shall be able to talk so much more frankly she spoke as if as a rule circumstances prevented her giving rein to this propensity and frankness of course is the only way out of this this extremely tiresome complication you know i suppose that my nephew thinks hes in love with your daughterinlaw margaret made a slight movement but her visitor pressed on without heeding it oh dont fancy please that im pretending to take a high moral ground though his mother does poor dear i can perfectly imagine that in a place like this ive just been driving about it for two hours a young man of guys age would have to provide himself with some sort of distraction and hes not the kind to go in for anything objectionable oh we quite allow for that we should allow for the whole affair if it hadnt so preposterously ended in his throwing over the girl he was engaged to and upsetting an arrangement that affected a number of people besides himself i understand that in the states its different the young people have only themselves to consider in england in our class i mean a great deal may depend on a young mans making a good match and in guys case i may say that his mother and sisters i wont include myself though i might have been simply stranded thrown overboard by his freak you can understand how serious it is when i tell you that its that and nothing else that has brought me all the way to america and my first idea was to go straight to your daughterinlaw since her influence is the only thing we can count on now and put it to her fairly as im putting it to you but on the whole i dare say its better to see you first you might give me an idea of the line to take with her im prepared to throw myself on her mercy margaret rose from her chair outwardly rigid in proportion to her inward tremor you dont understand she began lady caroline brushed the interruption aside oh but i do completely i cast no reflection on your daughterinlaw guy has made it quite clear to us that his attachment is has in short not been rewarded but dont you see that thats the worst part of it thered be much more hope of his recovering if mrs robert ransom had had margarets voice broke from her in a cry i am mrs robert ransom she said if lady caroline duckett had hitherto given her hostess the impression of a person not easily silenced this fact added sensibly to the effect produced by the intense stillness which now fell on her she sat quite motionless her large bangled hands clasped about the meagre fur boa she had unwound from her neck on entering her rusty black veil pushed up to the edge of a fringe of doubtful authenticity her thin lips parted on a gasp that seemed to sharpen itself on the edges of her teeth so overwhelming and helpless was her silence that margaret began to feel a motion of pity beneath her indignation a desire at least to facilitate the excuses which must terminate their disastrous colloquy but when lady caroline found voice she did not use it to excuse herself you cant be she said quite simply cant be margaret stammered with a flushing cheek i mean its some mistake are there two mrs robert ransoms in the same town your family arrangements are so extremely puzzling she had a farther rush of enlightenment oh i see i ought of course to have asked for mrs robert ransom junior the idea sent her to her feet with a haste which showed her impatience to make up for lost time there is no other mrs robert ransom at wentworth said margaret no other no junior are you sure lady caroline fell back into her seat again then i simply dont see she murmured helplessly margarets blush had fixed itself on her throbbing forehead she remained standing while her strange visitor continued to gaze at her with a perturbation in which the consciousness of indiscretion had evidently as yet no part i simply dont see she repeated suddenly she sprang up and advancing to margaret laid an inspired hand on her arm but my dear woman you can help us out all the same you can help us to find out who it is and you will wont you because as its not you you cant in the least mind what ive been saying margaret freeing her arm from her visitors hold drew back a step but lady caroline instantly rejoined her of course i can see that if it had been you might have been annoyed i dare say i put the case stupidly but im so bewildered by this new development by his using you all this time as a pretext that i really dont know where to turn for light on the mystery she had margaret in her imperious grasp again but the latter broke from her with a more resolute gesture im afraid i have no light to give you she began but once more lady caroline caught her up oh but do please understand me i condemn guy most strongly for using your name when we all know youd been so amazingly kind to him i havent a word to say in his defence but of course the important thing now is who is the woman since youre not the question rang out loudly as if all the pale puritan corners of the room flung it back with a shudder at the speaker in the silence that ensued margaret felt the blood ebbing back to her heart then she said in a distinct and level voice i know nothing of the history of mr dawnish lady caroline gave a stare and a gasp her distracted hand groped for her boa and she began to wind it mechanically about her long neck it would really be an enormous help to us and to poor gwendolen matcher she persisted pleadingly and youd be doing guy himself a good turn margaret remained silent and motionless while her visitor drew on one of the worn gloves she had pulled off to adjust her veil lady caroline gave the veil a final twitch ive come a tremendously long way she said and since it isnt you i cant think why you wont help me when the door had closed on her visitor margaret ransom went slowly up the stairs to her room as she dragged her feet from one step to another she remembered how she had sprung up the same steep flight after that visit of guy dawnishs when she had looked in the glass and seen on her face the blush of youth when she reached her room she bolted the door as she had done that day and again looked at herself in the narrow mirror above her dressingtable it was just a year since then the elms were budding again the willows hanging their green veil above the bench by the river but there was no trace of youth left in her face she saw it now as others had doubtless always seen it if it seemed as it did to lady caroline duckett what look must it have worn to the fresh gaze of young guy dawnish a pretext she had been a pretext he had used her name to screen some one else or perhaps merely to escape from a situation of which he was weary she did not care to conjecture what his motive had been everything connected with him had grown so remote and alien she felt no anger only an unspeakable sadness a sadness which she knew would never be appeased she looked at herself long and steadily she wished to clear her eyes of all illusions then she turned away and took her usual seat beside her worktable from where she sat she could look down the empty elmshaded street up which at this hour every day she was sure to see her husbands figure advancing she would see it presently she would see it for many years to come she had a sudden aching sense of the length of the years that stretched before her strange that one who was not young should still in all likelihood have so long to live nothing was changed in the setting of her life perhaps nothing would ever change in it she would certainly live and die in wentworth and meanwhile the days would go on as usual bringing the usual obligations as the word flitted through her brain she remembered that she had still to put the finishing touches to the paper she was to read the next afternoon at the meeting of the higher thought club the book she had been reading lay face downward beside her where she had left it an hour ago she took it up and slowly and painfully like a child laboriously spelling out the syllables she went on with the rest of the sentence and they spring from a level not much above that of the springing of the transverse and diagonal ribs which are so arranged as to give a convex curve to the surface of the vaulting conoid the verdict i had always thought jack gisburn rather a cheap genius though a good fellow enough so it was no great surprise to me to hear that in the height of his glory he had dropped his painting married a rich widow and established himself in a villa on the riviera though i rather thought it would have been rome or florence the height of his glory that was what the women called it i can hear mrs gideon thwing his last chicago sitter deploring his unaccountable abdication of course its going to send the value of my picture way up but i dont think of that mr rickham the loss to arrt is all i think of the word on mrs thwings lips multiplied its rs as though they were reflected in an endless vista of mirrors and it was not only the mrs thwings who mourned had not the exquisite hermia croft at the last grafton gallery show stopped me before gisburns moondancers to say with tears in her eyes we shall not look upon its like again well even through the prism of hermias tears i felt able to face the fact with equanimity poor jack gisburn the women had made him it was fitting that they should mourn him among his own sex fewer regrets were heard and in his own trade hardly a murmur professional jealousy perhaps if it were the honour of the craft was vindicated by little claude nutley who in all good faith brought out in the burlington a very handsome obituary on jack one of those showy articles stocked with random technicalities that i have heard i wont say by whom compared to gisburns painting and so his resolve being apparently irrevocable the discussion gradually died out and as mrs thwing had predicted the price of gisburns went up it was not till three years later that in the course of a few weeks idling on the riviera it suddenly occurred to me to wonder why gisburn had given up his painting on reflection it really was a tempting problem to accuse his wife would have been too easy his fair sitters had been denied the solace of saying that mrs gisburn had dragged him down for mrs gisburn as such had not existed till nearly a year after jacks resolve had been taken it might be that he had married her since he liked his ease because he didnt want to go on painting but it would have been hard to prove that he had given up his painting because he had married her of course if she had not dragged him down she had equally as miss croft contended failed to lift him up she had not led him back to the easel to put the brush into his hand again what a vocation for a wife but mrs gisburn appeared to have disdained it and i felt it might be interesting to find out why the desultory life of the riviera lends itself to such purely academic speculations and having on my way to monte carlo caught a glimpse of jacks balustraded terraces between the pines i had myself borne thither the next day i found the couple at tea beneath their palmtrees and mrs gisburns welcome was so genial that in the ensuing weeks i claimed it frequently it was not that my hostess was interesting on that point i could have given miss croft the fullest reassurance it was just because she was not interesting if i may be pardoned the bull that i found her so for jack all his life had been surrounded by interesting women they had fostered his art it had been reared in the hothouse of their adulation and it was therefore instructive to note what effect the deadening atmosphere of mediocrity i quote miss croft was having on him i have mentioned that mrs gisburn was rich and it was immediately perceptible that her husband was extracting from this circumstance a delicate but substantial satisfaction it is as a rule the people who scorn money who get most out of it and jacks elegant disdain of his wifes big balance enabled him with an appearance of perfect goodbreeding to transmute it into objects of art and luxury to the latter i must add he remained relatively indifferent but he was buying renaissance bronzes and eighteenthcentury pictures with a discrimination that bespoke the amplest resources moneys only excuse is to put beauty into circulation was one of the axioms he laid down across the sevres and silver of an exquisitely appointed luncheontable when on a later day i had again run over from monte carlo and mrs gisburn beaming on him added for my enlightenment jack is so morbidly sensitive to every form of beauty poor jack it had always been his fate to have women say such things of him the fact should be set down in extenuation what struck me now was that for the first time he resented the tone i had seen him so often basking under similar tributes was it the conjugal note that robbed them of their savour no for oddly enough it became apparent that he was fond of mrs gisburn fond enough not to see her absurdity it was his own absurdity he seemed to be wincing under his own attitude as an object for garlands and incense my dear since ive chucked painting people dont say that stuff about me they say it about victor grindle was his only protest as he rose from the table and strolled out onto the sunlit terrace i glanced after him struck by his last word victor grindle was in fact becoming the man of the moment as jack himself one might put it had been the man of the hour the younger artist was said to have formed himself at my friends feet and i wondered if a tinge of jealousy underlay the latters mysterious abdication but no for it was not till after that event that the rose dubarry drawingrooms had begun to display their grindles i turned to mrs gisburn who had lingered to give a lump of sugar to her spaniel in the diningroom why has he chucked painting i asked abruptly she raised her eyebrows with a hint of goodhumoured surprise oh he doesnt have to now you know and i want him to enjoy himself she said quite simply i looked about the spacious whitepanelled room with its familleverte vases repeating the tones of the pale damask curtains and its eighteenthcentury pastels in delicate faded frames has he chucked his pictures too i havent seen a single one in the house a slight shade of constraint crossed mrs gisburns open countenance its his ridiculous modesty you know he says theyre not fit to have about hes sent them all away except one my portrait and that i have to keep upstairs his ridiculous modesty jacks modesty about his pictures my curiosity was growing like the beanstalk i said persuasively to my hostess i must really see your portrait you know she glanced out almost timorously at the terrace where her husband lounging in a hooded chair had lit a cigar and drawn the russian deerhounds head between his knees well come while hes not looking she said with a laugh that tried to hide her nervousness and i followed her between the marble emperors of the hall and up the wide stairs with terracotta nymphs poised among flowers at each landing in the dimmest corner of her boudoir amid a profusion of delicate and distinguished objects hung one of the familiar oval canvases in the inevitable garlanded frame the mere outline of the frame called up all gisburns past mrs gisburn drew back the windowcurtains moved aside a jardiniere full of pink azaleas pushed an armchair away and said if you stand here you can just manage to see it i had it over the mantelpiece but he wouldnt let it stay yes i could just manage to see it the first portrait of jacks i had ever had to strain my eyes over usually they had the place of honour say the central panel in a pale yellow or rose dubarry drawingroom or a monumental easel placed so that it took the light through curtains of old venetian point the more modest place became the picture better yet as my eyes grew accustomed to the halflight all the characteristic qualities came out all the hesitations disguised as audacities the tricks of prestidigitation by which with such consummate skill he managed to divert attention from the real business of the picture to some pretty irrelevance of detail mrs gisburn presenting a neutral surface to work on forming as it were so inevitably the background of her own picture had lent herself in an unusual degree to the display of this false virtuosity the picture was one of jacks strongest as his admirers would have put it it represented on his part a swelling of muscles a congesting of veins a balancing straddling and straining that reminded one of the circusclowns ironic efforts to lift a feather it met in short at every point the demand of lovely woman to be painted strongly because she was tired of being painted sweetly and yet not to lose an atom of the sweetness its the last he painted you know mrs gisburn said with pardonable pride the last but one she corrected herself but the other doesnt count because he destroyed it destroyed it i was about to follow up this clue when i heard a footstep and saw jack himself on the threshold as he stood there his hands in the pockets of his velveteen coat the thin brown waves of hair pushed back from his white forehead his lean sunburnt cheeks furrowed by a smile that lifted the tips of a selfconfident moustache i felt to what a degree he had the same quality as his pictures the quality of looking cleverer than he was his wife glanced at him deprecatingly but his eyes travelled past her to the portrait mr rickham wanted to see it she began as if excusing herself he shrugged his shoulders still smiling oh rickham found me out long ago he said lightly then passing his arm through mine come and see the rest of the house he showed it to me with a kind of naive suburban pride the bathrooms the speakingtubes the dressclosets the trouserpresses all the complex simplifications of the millionaires domestic economy and whenever my wonder paid the expected tribute he said throwing out his chest a little yes i really dont see how people manage to live without that well it was just the end one might have foreseen for him only he was through it all and in spite of it all as he had been through and in spite of his pictures so handsome so charming so disarming that one longed to cry out be dissatisfied with your leisure as once one had longed to say be dissatisfied with your work but with the cry on my lips my diagnosis suffered an unexpected check this is my own lair he said leading me into a dark plain room at the end of the florid vista it was square and brown and leathery no effects no bricabrac none of the air of posing for reproduction in a picture weekly above all no least sign of ever having been used as a studio the fact brought home to me the absolute finality of jacks break with his old life dont you ever dabble with paint any more i asked still looking about for a trace of such activity never he said briefly or watercolour or etching his confident eyes grew dim and his cheeks paled a little under their handsome sunburn never think of it my dear fellow any more than if id never touched a brush and his tone told me in a flash that he never thought of anything else i moved away instinctively embarrassed by my unexpected discovery and as i turned my eye fell on a small picture above the mantelpiece the only object breaking the plain oak panelling of the room oh by jove i said it was a sketch of a donkey an old tired donkey standing in the rain under a wall by jove a stroud i cried he was silent but i felt him close behind me breathing a little quickly what a wonder made with a dozen lines but on everlasting foundations you lucky chap where did you get it he answered slowly mrs stroud gave it to me ah i didnt know you even knew the strouds he was such an inflexible hermit i didnt till after she sent for me to paint him when he was dead when he was dead you i must have let a little too much amazement escape through my surprise for he answered with a deprecating laugh yes shes an awful simpleton you know mrs stroud her only idea was to have him done by a fashionable painter ah poor stroud she thought it the surest way of proclaiming his greatness of forcing it on a purblind public and at the moment i was the fashionable painter ah poor stroud as you say was that his history that was his history she believed in him gloried in him or thought she did but she couldnt bear not to have all the drawingrooms with her she couldnt bear the fact that on varnishing days one could always get near enough to see his pictures poor woman shes just a fragment groping for other fragments stroud is the only whole i ever knew you ever knew but you just said gisburn had a curious smile in his eyes oh i knew him and he knew me only it happened after he was dead i dropped my voice instinctively when she sent for you yes quite insensible to the irony she wanted him vindicated and by me he laughed again and threw back his head to look up at the sketch of the donkey there were days when i couldnt look at that thing couldnt face it but i forced myself to put it here and now its cured me cured me thats the reason why i dont dabble any more my dear rickham or rather stroud himself is the reason for the first time my idle curiosity about my companion turned into a serious desire to understand him better i wish youd tell me how it happened i said he stood looking up at the sketch and twirling between his fingers a cigarette he had forgotten to light suddenly he turned toward me id rather like to tell you because ive always suspected you of loathing my work i made a deprecating gesture which he negatived with a goodhumoured shrug oh i didnt care a straw when i believed in myself and now its an added tie between us he laughed slightly without bitterness and pushed one of the deep armchairs forward there make yourself comfortable and here are the cigars you like he placed them at my elbow and continued to wander up and down the room stopping now and then beneath the picture how it happened i can tell you in five minutes and it didnt take much longer to happen i can remember now how surprised and pleased i was when i got mrs strouds note of course deep down i had always felt there was no one like him only i had gone with the stream echoed the usual platitudes about him till i half got to think he was a failure one of the kind that are left behind by jove and he was left behind because he had come to stay the rest of us had to let ourselves be swept along or go under but he was high above the current on everlasting foundations as you say well i went off to the house in my most egregious mood rather moved lord forgive me at the pathos of poor strouds career of failure being crowned by the glory of my painting him of course i meant to do the picture for nothing i told mrs stroud so when she began to stammer something about her poverty i remember getting off a prodigious phrase about the honour being mine oh i was princely my dear rickham i was posing to myself like one of my own sitters then i was taken up and left alone with him i had sent all my traps in advance and i had only to set up the easel and get to work he had been dead only twentyfour hours and he died suddenly of heart disease so that there had been no preliminary work of destruction his face was clear and untouched i had met him once or twice years before and thought him insignificant and dingy now i saw that he was superb i was glad at first with a merely aesthetic satisfaction glad to have my hand on such a subject then his strange lifelikeness began to affect me queerly as i blocked the head in i felt as if he were watching me do it the sensation was followed by the thought if he were watching me what would he say to my way of working my strokes began to go a little wild i felt nervous and uncertain once when i looked up i seemed to see a smile behind his close grayish beard as if he had the secret and were amusing himself by holding it back from me that exasperated me still more the secret why i had a secret worth twenty of his i dashed at the canvas furiously and tried some of my bravura tricks but they failed me they crumbled i saw that he wasnt watching the showy bits i couldnt distract his attention he just kept his eyes on the hard passages between those were the ones i had always shirked or covered up with some lying paint and how he saw through my lies i looked up again and caught sight of that sketch of the donkey hanging on the wall near his bed his wife told me afterward it was the last thing he had done just a note taken with a shaking hand when he was down in devonshire recovering from a previous heart attack just a note but it tells his whole history there are years of patient scornful persistence in every line a man who had swum with the current could never have learned that mighty upstream stroke i turned back to my work and went on groping and muddling then i looked at the donkey again i saw that when stroud laid in the first stroke he knew just what the end would be he had possessed his subject absorbed it recreated it when had i done that with any of my things they hadnt been born of me i had just adopted them hang it rickham with that face watching me i couldnt do another stroke the plain truth was i didnt know where to put it i had never known only with my sitters and my public a showy splash of colour covered up the fact i just threw paint into their faces well paint was the one medium those dead eyes could see through see straight to the tottering foundations underneath dont you know how in talking a foreign language even fluently one says half the time not what one wants to but what one can well that was the way i painted and as he lay there and watched me the thing they called my technique collapsed like a house of cards he didnt sneer you understand poor stroud he just lay there quietly watching and on his lips through the gray beard i seemed to hear the question are you sure you know where youre coming out if i could have painted that face with that question on it i should have done a great thing the next greatest thing was to see that i couldnt and that grace was given me but oh at that minute rickham was there anything on earth i wouldnt have given to have stroud alive before me and to hear him say its not too late ill show you how it was too late it would have been even if hed been alive i packed up my traps and went down and told mrs stroud of course i didnt tell her that it would have been greek to her i simply said i couldnt paint him that i was too moved she rather liked the idea shes so romantic it was that that made her give me the donkey but she was terribly upset at not getting the portrait she did so want him done by some one showy at first i was afraid she wouldnt let me off and at my wits end i suggested grindle yes it was i who started grindle i told mrs stroud he was the coming man and she told somebody else and so it got to be true and he painted stroud without wincing and she hung the picture among her husbands things he flung himself down in the armchair near mine laid back his head and clasping his arms beneath it looked up at the picture above the chimneypiece i like to fancy that stroud himself would have given it to me if hed been able to say what he thought that day and in answer to a question i put halfmechanically begin again he flashed out when the one thing that brings me anywhere near him is that i knew enough to leave off he stood up and laid his hand on my shoulder with a laugh only the irony of it is that i am still painting since grindles doing it for me the strouds stand alone and happen once but theres no exterminating our kind of art the potboiler i the studio faced north looking out over a dismal reach of roofs and chimneys and rusty fireescapes hung with heterogeneous garments a crust of dirty snow covered the level surfaces and a december sky with more snow in it lowered over them the room was bare and gaunt with blotched walls and a stained uneven floor on a divan lay a pile of properties limp draperies an algerian scarf a motheaten fan of peacock feathers the janitor had forgotten to fill the coalscuttle overnight and the castiron stove projected its cold flanks into the room like a black iceberg ned stanwell who had just added his hat and greatcoat to the miscellaneous heap on the divan turned from the empty stove with a shiver by jove this is a little too much like the last act of boheme he said slipping into his coat again after a vain glance at the coalscuttle much solitude and a lively habit of mind had bred in him the habit of audible soliloquy and having flung a shout for the janitor down the seven flights dividing the studio from the basement he turned back picking up the thread of his monologue exactly like boheme really that crack in the wall is much more like a stagecrack than a real one just the sort of crack mungold would paint if he were doing a humble interior mungold the fashionable portraitpainter of the hour was the favourite object of the younger mens irony it only needs kate arran to be borne in dying stanwell continued with a laugh much more likely to be poor little caspar though he concluded his neighbour across the landing the little sculptor caspar arran humorously called gasper on account of his bronchial asthma had lately been joined by a sister kate arran a strapping girl fresh from the country who had installed herself in the little room off her brothers studio keeping house for him with a chafingdish and a coffeemachine to the mirth and envy of the other young men in the building poor little gasper had been very bad all the autumn and it was surmised that his sisters presence which he spoke of growlingly as a troublesome necessity devolved on him by the inopportune death of an aunt was really an indication of his failing ability to take care of himself kate arran took his complaints with unfailing goodhumour darned his socks brushed his clothes fed him with steaming broths and foaming milkpunches and listened with reverential assent to his interminable disquisitions on art every one in the house was sorry for little gasper and the other fellows liked him all the more because it was so impossible to like his sculpture but his talk was a bore and when his colleagues ran in to see him they were apt to keep a hand on the doorknob and to plead a pressing engagement at least they had been till kate came but now they began to show a disposition to enter and sit down caspar who was no fool perceived the change and perhaps detected its cause at any rate he showed no special gratification at the increased cordiality of his friends and kate who followed him in everything took this as a sign that guests were to be discouraged there was one exception however ned stanwell who was deplorably goodnatured had always lent a patient ear to caspar and he now reaped his reward by being taken into kates favour before she had been a month in the building they were on confidential terms as to caspars health and lately stanwell had penetrated farther even to the inmost recesses of her anxiety about her brothers career caspar had recently had a bad blow in the refusal of his magnum opus a vast allegorical group by the commissioners of the minneapolis exhibition he took the rejection with promethean irony proclaimed it as the clinching proof of his ability and abounded in reasons why even in an age of such crass artistic ignorance a refusal so egregious must react to the advantage of its object but his sisters indignation if as glowing was a shade less hopeful of course caspar was going to succeed she knew it was only a question of time but she paled at the word and turned imploring eyes on stanwell was there time enough it was the one element in the combination that she could not count on and stanwell reddening under her look of interrogation and cursing his own glaring robustness would affirm that of course of course of course by everything that was holy there was time enough with the mental reservation that there wouldnt be even if poor caspar lived to be a hundred vos that you yelling for the shanitor mr sdanwell inquired an affable voice through the doorway and stanwell turning with a laugh confronted the squat figure of a middleaged man in an expensive fur coat who looked as if his face secreted the oil which he used on his hair hullo shepson i should say i was yelling did you ever feel such an atmosphere that fool has forgotten to light the stove come in but for heavens sake dont take off your coat mr shepson glanced about the studio with a look which seemed to say that where so much else was lacking the absence of a fire hardly added to the general sense of destitution vell you aint as vell fixed as mr mungold ever been to his studio mr sdanwell de most ex quisite blush hangings and a gasfire choost as natural oh hang it shepson do you call that a studio its like a manicures parlour or a beautydoctors by george broke off stanwell and thats just what he is a peautydoctor yes oh well you wouldnt see murmured stanwell mentally storing his epigram for more appreciative ears but you didnt come just to make me envious of mungolds studio did you and he pushed forward a chair for his visitor the latter however declined it with an affable motion of gourse not of gourse not but mr mungold is a sensible man he makes a lot of money you know is that what you came to tell me said stanwell still humorously my gootness no i was downstairs looking at holbrooks sdained class and i shoost thought id sdep up a minute and take a beep at your vork much obliged im sure especially as i assume that you dont want any of it try as he would stanwell could not keep a note of eagerness from his voice mr shepson caught the note and eyed him shrewdly through goldrimmed glasses vell vell vell im not prepared to commit myself shoost let me take a look round vill you with the greatest pleasure and ill give another shout for the coal stanwell went out on the landing and mr shepson left to himself began a meditative progress about the room on an easel facing the improvised dais stood a canvas on which a young womans head had been blocked in it was just in that happy state of semievocation when a picture seems to detach itself from the grossness of its medium and live a wondrous moment in the actual and the quality of the head in question a vigorous dusky youthfulness a kind of virgin majesty lent itself to this illusion of vitality stanwell who had reentered the studio could not help drawing a sharp breath as he saw the picturedealer pausing with tilted head before this portrait it seemed at one moment so impossible that he should not be struck with it at the next so incredible that he should be shepson cocked his parroteye at the canvas with a desultory vats dat which sent a twinge through the young man that oh a sketch of a young lady stammered stanwell flushing at the imbecility of his reply its miss arran you know he added the sister of my neighbour here the sculptor sgulpture theres no market for modern sgulpture except tombstones said shepson disparagingly passing on as if he included the sisters portrait in his condemnation of her brothers trade stanwell smiled but more at himself than shepson how could he ever have supposed that the gross fool would see anything in his sketch of kate arran he stood aside straining after detachment while the dealer continued his round of exploration waddling up to the canvases on the walls prodding with his stick at those stacked in corners prying and peering sideways like a great bird rummaging for seed he seemed to find little nutriment in the course of his search for the sounds he emitted expressed a weary distaste for misdirected effort and he completed his round without having thought it worth while to draw a single canvas from its obscurity as his visits always had the same result stanwell was reduced to wondering why he had come again but shepson was not the man to indulge in vague roamings through the field of art and it was safe to conclude that his purpose would in due course reveal itself his tour brought him at length face to face with the painter where he paused clasping his plump gloved hands behind his back and shaking an admonitory head gleffer very gleffer of course i suppose youll let me know when you want to sell anything let you know gasped stanwell to whom the room grew so glowingly hot that he thought for a moment the janitor must have made up the fire shepson gave a dry laugh vell it doesnt sdrike me that you want to now doing this kind of thing you know and he swept a comprehensive hand about the studio ah said stanwell who could not keep a note of flatness out of his laugh see here mr sdanwell vot do you do it for if you do it for yourself and the other fellows vell and good only dont ask me round i sell pictures i dont theorize about them ven you vant to sell gome to me with what my gustomers vant you can do it youre smart enough you can do most anything veres dat bortrait of gladys glyde dat you showed at the fake club last autumn dat little thing in de romney sdyle dat vas a little shem now exclaimed mr shepson whose pronunciation became increasingly semitic in moments of excitement stanwell stared called upon a few months previously to contribute to an exhibition of skits on wellknown artists he had used the photograph of a favourite musichall star as the basis of a picture in the pseudohistorical style affected by the popular portraitpainters of the day that thing he said contemptuously how on earth did you happen to see it i see everything returned the dealer with an oracular smile if youve got it here let me look at it please it cost stanwell a few minutes search to unearth his skit a clever blending of dash and sentimentality in just the right proportion to create the impression of a powerful brush subdued to mildness by the charms of the sitter stanwell had thrown it off in a burst of imitative frenzy beginning for the mere joy of the satire but gradually fascinated by the problem of producing the requisite mingling of attributes he was surprised now to see how well he had caught the note and shepsons face reflected his approval by george dats something like the dealer ejaculated like what like mungold stanwell laughed like business like a big order for a bortrait mr sdanwell dats what its like cried shepson swinging round on him stanwells stare widened an order for me vy not accidents vill happen said shepson jocosely de fact is mrs archer millington wants to be bainted you know her sdyle well she prides herself on her likeness to little gladys and so ven she saw dat bicture of yours at de fake show she made a note of your name and de udder day she sent for me and she says mr shepson im tired of mungold all my friends are done by mungold i vant to break away and be orishinal i vant to be done by the bainter that did gladys glyde shepson waited to observe the result of this overwhelming announcement and stanwell after a momentary halt of surprise brought out laughingly but this is a mungold is this what she calls being original shoost exactly said shepson with unexpected acuteness thats vat dey all want something different from what all deir friends have got but shoost like it all de same dats de public all over mrs millington dont want a mungold because everybodys got a mungold but she wants a picture thats in the same sdyle because dats de sdyle and shes afraid of any oder stanwell was listening with real enjoyment ah you know your public he murmured vell you do too or you couldnt have painted dat the dealer retorted and i dont say deyre wrong mind dat i like a bretty picture myself and i understand the way dey feel deyre villing to let sargent take liberties vid them because its like being punched in de ribs by a king but if anybody else baints them they vant to look as sweet as an obituary he turned earnestly to stanwell the thing is to attract their notice vonce you got it they vont gif you dime to sleep and dats why im here today youve attracted mrs millingtons notice and vonce youre hung in dat new ballroom dats vere she vants you in a big gold panel vonce youre dere vy youll be like the pianola no home gompleat without you and i aint going to charge you any commission on the first job he stood before the painter exuding a mixture of deference and patronage in which either element might predominate as events developed but stanwell could see in the incident only the stuff for a good story my dear shepson he said what are you talking about this is no picture of mine why dont you ask me to do you a corot at once i hear theres a great demand for them still in the west or an arthur schracker i can do schracker as well as mungold he added turning around a small canvas at which a paintpot seemed to have been hurled with violence from a considerable distance shepson ignored the allusion to corot but screwed his eyes at the picture ah schracker vell the schracker sdyle would take first rate if you were a foreigner but for goodness sake dont try it on mrs millington stanwell pushed the two skits aside oh you can trust me he cried humorously the pearls and the eyes very large the extremities very small isnt that about the size of it dats it dats it and the cheque as big as you vant to make it mrs millington vants the picture finished in time for her first barty in the new ballroom and if you rush the job she wont sdickle at an extra thousand vill you come along with me now and arrange for your first sitting he stood before the young man urgent paternal and so imbued with the importance of his mission that his face stretched to a ludicrous length of dismay when stanwell administering a goodhumoured push to his shoulder cried gaily my dear fellow it will make my price rise still higher when the lady hears im too busy to take any orders at present and that im actually obliged to turn you out now because im expecting a sitter it was part of shepsons business to have a quick ear for the note of finality and he offered no resistance to stanwells friendly impulsion but on the threshold he paused to murmur with a regretful glance at the denuded studio you could haf done it mr sdanwell you could haf done it ii kate arran was stanwells sitter but the janitor had hardly filled the stove when she came in to say that she could not sit caspar had had a bad night he was depressed and feverish and in spite of his protests she had resolved to fetch the doctor care sat on her usually tranquil features and stanwell as he offered to go for the doctor wished he could have caught in his picture the wide gloom of her brow there was always a kind of biblical breadth in the expression of her emotions and today she suggested a text from isaiah but youre not busy she hesitated in the full voice which seemed tuned to a solemn rhetoric i meant to be with you but since thats off im quite unemployed she smiled interrogatively i thought perhaps you had an order i met mr shepson rubbing his hands on the landing was he rubbing his hands well it was not over me he says that from the style of my pictures he doesnt suppose i want to sell she looked at him superbly well do you he embraced his bleak walls in a circular gesture judge for yourself ah but its splendidly furnished with rejected pictures you mean with ideals she exclaimed in a tone caught from her brother and which would have been irritating to stanwell if it had not been moving he gave a slight shrug and took up his hat but she interposed to say that if it didnt make any difference she would prefer to have him go and sit with poor caspar while she ran for the doctor and did some household errands by the way stanwell divined in her request the need for a brief respite from caspar and though he shivered at the thought of her facing the cold in the scant jacket which had been her only wear since he had known her he let her go without a protest and betook himself to arrans studio he found the little sculptor dressed and roaming fretfully about the melancholy room in which he and his plastic offspring lodged together in one corner where kates chair and worktable stood a scrupulous order prevailed but the rest of the apartment had the dreary untidiness the damp grey look which the worker in clay usually creates about him in the centre of this desert stood the shrouded image of caspars disappointment the colossal rejected group as to which his friends could seldom remember whether it represented jove hurling a titan from olympus or science subjugating religion caspar was the sworn foe of religion which he appeared to regard as indirectly connected with his inability to sell his statues the sculptor was too ill to work and stanwells appearance loosed the pentup springs of his talk hullo what are you doing here i thought kate had gone over to sit to you she wanted a little fresh air i should say enough of it came in through these windows how like a woman when shes agreed to do a certain thing to make up her mind at once that shes got to do another they dont call it caprice its always duty thats the humour of it ill be bound kate alleged a pressing engagement sorry she should waste your time so my dear fellow here am i with plenty of it to burn look at my hand shake i cant do a thing well luckily nobody wants me to posterity may suffer but the present generation isnt worrying the present generation wants to be carved in sugarcandy or painted in maple syrup it doesnt want to be told the truth about itself or about anything in the universe the prophets have always lived in a garret my dear fellow only the ravens dont always find out their address speaking of ravens though kate told me she saw old shepson coming out of your place i say old man youre not meditating an apostasy youre not doing the kind of thing that shepson would look at stanwell laughed oh he looked at them but only to confirm his reasons for rejecting them ha ha thats right he wanted to refresh his memory with their badness but how on earth did he happen to have any doubts on the subject i should as soon have thought of his coming in here stanwell winced at the analogy but replied in caspars key oh hes not as sure of any of us as he is of you the sculptor received this tribute with a joyous expletive by god no hes sure of me as you say he and his tribe know that ill starve in my tracks sooner than make a concession a single concession a fellow came after me once to do an angel on a tombstone an angel leaning against a broken column and looking as if it was waiting for the elevator and wondering why in hell it didnt come he said he wanted me to show that the deceased was pining to get to heaven as she was his wife i didnt dispute the proposition but when i asked him what he understood by heaven he grabbed his hat and walked out of the studio he didnt wait for the elevator stanwell listened with a practised smile the story of the man who had come to order the angel was so familiar to arrans friends that its only interest consisted in waiting to see what variation he would give to the retort which had put the mourner to flight it was generally supposed that this visit represented the sculptors nearest approach to an order and one of his fellowcraftsmen had been heard to remark that if caspar had made the tombstone the lady under it would have tried harder than ever to get to heaven to stanwells present mood however there was something more than usually irritating in the gratuitous assumption that arran had only to derogate from his altitude to have a press of purchasers at his door well what did you gain by kicking your widower out he objected why cant a man do two kinds of work one to please himself and the other to boil the pot caspar stopped in his jerky walk the stride of a tall man attempted with short legs it sometimes appeared to stanwell to symbolize his artistic endeavour why cant a man why cant he you ask me that stanwell he blazed out yes and whats more ill answer you it isnt everybody who can adapt his art as he wants to caspar stood before him gasping with incredulous scorn adapt his art as he wants to unhappy wretch what lingo are you talking if you mean that it isnt every honest man who can be a renegade thats just what i do mean he cant unless hes clever enough to see the other side the deep groan with which caspar met this casuistry was cut short by a knock at the studio door which thereupon opened to admit a small dapperlydressed man with a silky moustache and mildlybulging eyes ah mungold exclaimed stanwell to cover the gloomy silence with which arran received the newcomer whereat the latter with the air of a man who does not easily believe himself unwelcome bestowed a sympathetic pressure on the sculptors hand my dear chap ive just met miss arran and she told me you were laid up with a bad cold so i thought id pop in and cheer you up a little he looked about him with a smile evidently intended as the first act in his beneficent programme mr mungold freshly soaped and scented with a neat glaze of gentility extending from his varnished boottips to his glossy hat looked like the flattered portrait of a common man just such an idealized presentment as his own brush might have produced as a rule however he devoted himself to the portrayal of the other sex painting ladies in syrup as arran said with marshmallow children leaning against their knees he was as quick as a dressmaker at catching new ideas and the style of his pictures changed as rapidly as that of the fashionplates one year all his sitters were done on oval canvases with gauzy draperies and a background of clouds the next they were seated under an immemorial elm caressing enormous dogs obviously constructed out of doormats whatever their occupation they always looked straight out of the canvas giving the impression that their eyes were fixed on an invisible camera this gave rise to the rumour that mungold did his portraits from photographs it was even said that he had invented a way of transferring an enlarged photograph to the canvas so that all that remained was to fill in the colours if he heard of this charge he took it calmly but probably it had not reached the high spheres in which he moved and in which he was esteemed for painting pearls better and making unsuggestive children look lovelier than any of his fellowcraftsmen mr mungold in fact deemed it a part of his professional duty to study his sitters in their homelife and as this life was chiefly led in the homes of others he was too busy dining out and going to the opera to mingle much with his colleagues but as no one is wholly consistent mr mungold had lately belied his ambitions by falling in love with kate arran and with that gentle persistency which made him so wonderful in managing obstreperous infantile sitters he had contrived to establish a precarious footing in her brothers studio part of his success was due to the fact that he could not easily think himself the object of a rebuff if it seemed to hit him he regarded it as deflected from its aim and brushed it aside with a discreet gesture a touch of comedy was lent to the situation by the fact that till kate arrans coming mungold had always served as her brothers awful example it was a mark of arrans lack of humour that he persisted in regarding the little man as a conscious apostate instead of perceiving that he painted as he could in a world which really looked to him like a vast confectioners window stanwell had never quite divined how mungold had won over the sister to whom her brothers prejudices were a religion but he suspected the painter of having united a deep belief in caspars gifts with the occasional offer of opportune delicacies the portwine or game which kate had no other means of procuring for her patient stanwell persuaded that mungold would stick to his post till miss arrans return felt himself freed from his promise to the latter and left the incongruous pair to themselves there had been a time when it amused him to see caspar submerge the painter in a torrent of turbid eloquence and to watch poor mungold sputtering under the rush of denunciation yet emitting little bland phrases of assent like a gentleman drowning correctly in gloves and eyeglasses but stanwell was beginning to find less food for gaiety than for envy in the contemplation of his colleague after all mungold held his ground he did not go under spite of his manifest absurdity he had succeeded in propitiating the sister in making himself tolerated by the brother and the fact that his success was due to the ability to purchase portwine and game was not in this case a mitigating circumstance stanwell knew that the arrans really preferred him to mungold but the knowledge only sharpened his envy of the latter whose friendship could command visible tokens of expression while poor stanwells remained gloomily inarticulate as he returned to his overpopulated studio and surveyed anew the pictures of which shepson had not offered to relieve him he found himself wishing not for mungolds lack of scruples for he believed him to be the most scrupulous of men but for that happy mean of talent which so completely satisfied the artistic requirements of the inartistic mungold was not to be despised as an apostate he was to be congratulated as a man whose aptitudes were exactly in line with the taste of the persons he liked to dine with at this point in his meditations stanwells eye fell on the portrait of miss gladys glyde it was really as shepson said as good as a mungold yet it could never be made to serve the same purpose because it was the work of a man who knew it was bad art that at least would have been caspar arrans contention poor caspar who produced as bad art in the service of the loftiest convictions the distinction began to look like mere casuistry to stanwell he had never been very proud of his own adaptability it had seemed to him to indicate the lack of an individual standpoint and he had tried to counteract it by the cultivation of an aggressively personal style but the cursed knack was in his fingers he was always at the mercy of some other mans sensations and there were moments when he blushed to remember that his grandfather had spent a laborious lifetime in rome copying the old masters for a generation which lacked the facile resource of the camera now however it struck him that the ancestral versatility might be a useful inheritance in art after all the greatest of them did what they could and if a man could do several things instead of one why should he not profit by the multiplicity of his gifts if one had two talents why not serve two masters iii stanwell while seeing caspar through the attack which had been the cause of his sisters arrival had struck up a friendship with the young doctor who climbed the patients seven flights with unremitting fidelity the two since then had continued to exchange confidences regarding the sculptors health and stanwell anxious to waylay the doctor after his visit left the studio door ajar and went out when he heard a sound of leavetaking across the landing but it appeared that the doctor had just come and that it was mungold who was making his adieux the latter at once assumed that stanwell had been on the alert for him and met the supposed advance by affably inviting himself into the studio may i come and take a look around my dear fellow i have been meaning to drop in for an age mungold always spoke with a girlish emphasis and effusiveness but i have been so busy getting up mrs van orleys tableaux english eighteenth century portraits you know that really what with that and my sittings ive hardly had time to think and then you know you owe me about a dozen visits but youre a savage you dont pay visits you stay here and piocher which is wiser as the results prove ah youre very strong immensely strong he paused in the middle of the studio glancing about a little apprehensively as though he thought the stored energy of the pictures might result in an explosion very original very striking ah miss arran a powerful head but excuse the suggestion isnt there just the least little lack of sweetness you dont think she has the sweet type perhaps not but could she be so lovely if she were not intensely feminine just at present though she is not looking her best she is horribly tired i am afraid there is very little money left and poor dear caspar is so impossible he wont hear of a loan otherwise i should be most happy but i came just now to propose a piece of work in fact to give him an order mrs archer millington has built a new ballroom as i daresay you may have seen in the papers and she has been kind enough to ask me for some hints oh merely as a friend i dont presume to do more than advise but her decorator wants to do something with cupids something light and playful you understand and so i ventured to say that i knew a very clever sculptor well i do believe caspar has talent latent talent you know and at any rate a job of that sort would be a big lift for him at least i thought he would regard it so but you should have heard him when i showed him the decorators sketch he asked me what the cupids were to be done in lard and if i thought he had had his training at a confectioners and i dont know what more besides but he worked himself up to such a degree that he brought on a frightful fit of coughing and miss arran im afraid was rather annoyed with me when she came in though im sure an order from mrs archer millington is not a thing that would annoy most people mr mungold paused breathless with the rehearsal of his wrongs and stanwell said with a smile you know poor caspar is terribly stiff on the purity of the artists aim the artists aim mr mungold stared what is the artists aim but to please isnt that the purpose of all true art but his theories are so extravagant i really dont know what i shall say to mrs millington she is not used to being refused i suppose i had better put it on the ground of illhealth the artist glanced at his handsome repeater dear me i promised to be at mrs van orleys before twelve oclock we are to settle about the curtain before luncheon my dear fellow it has been a privilege to see your work by the way you have never done any modelling i suppose youre so extraordinarily versatile i didnt know whether you might care to undertake the cupids yourself stanwell had to wait a long time for the doctor and when the latter came out he looked grave worse no he couldnt say that caspar was worse but then he wasnt any better there was nothing mortal the matter but the question was how long he could hold out it was the kind of case where there is no use in drugs he had just scribbled a prescription to quiet miss arran its the cold i suppose stanwell groaned he ought to be shipped off to florida the doctor made a negative gesture florida be hanged what he wants is to sell his group that would set him up quicker than sitting on the equator sell his group stanwell echoed but hes so indifferent to recognition he believes in himself so thoroughly i thought at first he would be hard hit when the exhibition committee refused it but he seems to regard that as another proof of its superiority his visitor turned on him the penetrating eye of the confessor indifferent to recognition hes eating his heart out for it cant you see that all that talk is just so much whistling to keep his courage up the name of his disease is failure and i cant write the prescription that will cure that complaint but if somebody would come along and take a fancy to those two naked parties who are breaking each others heads wed have mr caspar putting on a pound a day the truth of this diagnosis became suddenly vivid to stanwell how dull of him not to have seen before that it was not cold or privation which was killing caspar not anxiety for his sisters future nor the ache of watching her daily struggle but simply the cankering thought that he might die before he had made himself known it was his vanity that was starving to death and all mungolds hampers could not appease that hunger stanwell was not shocked by the discovery he was only the more sorry for the little man who was after all denied that solace of selfsufficiency which his talk so noisily proclaimed his lot seemed hard enough when stanwell had pictured him as buoyed up by the scorn of public opinion it became tragic if he was denied that support the artist wondered if kate had guessed her brothers secret or if she were still the dupe of his stoicism stanwell was sure that the sculptor would take no one into his confidence and least of all his sister whose faith in his artistic independence was the chief prop of that tottering pose kates penetration was not great and stanwell recalled the incredulous smile with which she had heard him defend poor mungolds sincerity against caspars assaults but she had the insight of the heart and where her brothers happiness was concerned she might have seen deeper than any of them it was this last consideration which took the strongest hold on stanwell he felt caspars sufferings chiefly through the thought of his sisters possible disillusionment iv within three months two events had set the studio building talking stanwell had painted a fulllength portrait of mrs archer millington and caspar arran had received an order to execute his group in marble the name of the sculptors patron had not been divulged the order came through shepson who explained that an american customer living abroad having seen a photograph of the group in one of the papers had at once cabled home to secure it he intended to bestow it on a public building in america and not wishing to advertise his munificence had preferred that even the sculptor should remain ignorant of his name the group bought by an enlightened compatriot for the adornment of a civic building in his native land there could hardly be a more complete vindication of unappreciated genius and caspar made the most of the argument he was not exultant he was sublimely magnanimous he had always said that he could afford to await the verdict of posterity and his unknown patrons act clearly shadowed forth that impressive decision happily it also found expression in a cheque which it would have taken more philosophy to await the group was paid for in advance and kates joy in her brothers recognition was deliciously mingled with the thrill of ordering him some new clothes and coaxing him out to dine succulently at a neighbouring restaurant caspar flourished insufferably on this regime he began to strike the attitude of the recognized great master who gives advice and encouragement to the struggling neophyte he held himself up as an example of the reward of disinterestedness of the triumph of the artist who clings obstinately to his convictions a man must believe in his star look at napoleon its the dogged trust in ones convictions that tells it always ends by forcing the public into line only be sure you make no concessions dont give in to any of their humbug an artist who listens to the critics is ruined they never have any use for the poor devils who do what they tell them to run after fame and shell keep you running but stay in your own corner and do your own work and by george sir shell come crawling up to you and ask to have her likeness done these exhortations were chiefly directed to stanwell partly because the inmates of the other studios were apt to elude them partly also because the rumours concerning stanwells portrait of mrs millington had begun to disquiet the sculptor at first he had taken a condescending interest in the fact of his friends receiving an order and had admonished him not to lose the chance of showing up his sitter and her environment it was a splendid opportunity for a fellow with a message to be introduced into the tents of the philistine and stanwell was charged to drive a long sharp nail into the enemys skull but presently arran began to suspect that the portrait was not as comminatory as he could have wished mungold the most kindly of rivals let drop a word of injudicious praise the picture he said promised to be delightfully in keeping with the decorations of the ballroom and the ladys gown harmonized exquisitely with the windowcurtains stanwell called to account by his monitor reminded the latter that he himself had been selected by mungold to do the cupids for mrs millingtons ballroom and that the friendly artists praise could therefore not be taken as positive evidence of incapacity ah but i didnt do them i kicked him out caspar rejoined and stanwell could only plead that even in the cause of art one could hardly kick a lady ah thats the worst of it if the women get at you youre lost youre young youre impressionable you wont mind my saying that youre not built for a stoic and hang it theyll coddle you theyll enervate you theyll sentimentalize you theyll make a mungold of you ah poor mungold stanwell laughed if he lived the life of an anchorite he couldnt help painting pictures that would please mrs millington whereas you could kate interjected raising her head from the ironingboard where sphinxlike magnificent she swung a splendid arm above her brothers shirts oh well perhaps i shant please her perhaps i shall elevate her taste caspar directed a groan to his sister thats what they all think at first childe roland to the dark tower came but inside the dark tower theres the venusberg oh i dont mean that youll be taken with truffles and plush footmen like mungold but praise my poor ned praise is a deadly drug its the absinthe of the artist and theyll stupefy you with it youll wallow in the mire of success stanwell raised a protesting hand really for one order youre a little lurid one havent you already had a dozen others only one other so far and im not sure i shall do that not sure wavering already thats the way the mischief begins if the women get a fad for you theyll work you like a galleyslave youll have to do your round of copy every morning what becomes of inspiration then how are you going to loaf and invite the soul dont barter your birthright for a mess of pottage oh i understand the temptation i know the taste of money and success but look at me stanwell you know how long i had to wait for recognition well now its come to me i dont mean to let it knock me off my feet i dont mean to let myself be overworked i have already made it known that i will not be bullied into taking more orders than i can do full justice to and my sister is with me god bless her kate would rather go on ironing my shirts in a garret than see me prostitute my art kates glance radiantly confirmed this declaration of independence and stanwell with his evasive laugh asked her if meanwhile she should object to his investing a part of his illgotten gains in theatre tickets for the party that evening it appeared that stanwell had also been paid in advance and well paid for he began to permit himself various mild distractions in which he generally contrived to have the arrans share it seemed perfectly natural to kate that caspars friends should spend their money for his recreation and by one of the most touching sophistries of her sex she thus reconciled herself to the anomaly of taking a little pleasure on her own account mungold was less often in the way for she had never been able to forgive him for proposing that caspar should do mrs millingtons cupids and for a few radiant weeks stanwell had the undisputed enjoyment of her pride in her brothers achievement stanwell had rushed through mrs millingtons portrait in time for the opening of her new ballroom and it was perhaps in return for this favour that she consented to let the picture be exhibited at a big portrait show which was held in april for the benefit of a fashionable charity in mrs millingtons ballroom the picture had been seen and approved only by the distinguished few who had access to that social sanctuary but on the walls of the exhibition it became a centre of comment and discussion one of the immediate results of this publicity was a visit from shepson with two or three orders in his pocket as he put it he surveyed the studio with fresh disgust asked stanwell why he did not move and was impressed rather than downcast on learning that the painter had not decided whether he would take any more orders that spring you might haf a studio at newport he suggested it would be rather new to do your sitters out of doors with the sea behind them showing they had a blace on the gliffs the picture produced a different and less flattering effect on the critics they gave it indeed more space than they had ever before accorded to the artists efforts but their estimate seemed to confirm caspar arrans forebodings and stanwell had perhaps never despised them so little as when he read their comments on his work on the whole however neither praise nor blame disquieted him greatly he was engrossed in the contemplation of kate arrans happiness and basking in the refracted warmth it shed about her the doctors prognostications had come true caspar was putting on a pound a week and had plunged into a fresh creation more symbolic and encumbering than the monument of which he had been so opportunely relieved if there was any cloud on stanwells enjoyment of life it was caused by the discovery that success had quadrupled caspars artistic energies meanwhile it was delightful to see kates joy in her brothers recovered capacity for work and to listen to the axioms which for stanwells guidance she deduced from the example of caspars heroic pursuit of the ideal there was nothing repellent in kates borrowed didacticism and if it sometimes bored stanwell to hear her quote her brother he was sure it would never bore him to be quoted by her himself and there were moments when he felt he had nearly achieved that distinction caspar was not addicted to the visiting of art exhibitions he took little interest in any productions save his own and was moreover disposed to believe that good pictures like clever criminals are apt to go unhung stanwell therefore thought it unlikely that his portrait of mrs millington would be seen by kate who was not given to independent explorations in the field of art but one day on entering the exhibition which he had hitherto rather nervously shunned he saw the arrans at the end of the gallery in which the portrait hung they were not looking at it they were moving away from it and to stanwells quickened perceptions their attitude seemed almost that of flight for a moment he thought of flying too then a desperate resolve nerved him to meet them and stemming the crowd he made a circuit which brought him face to face with their retreat the room in which they met was momentarily empty and there was nothing to intervene between the shock of their interchanged glances caspar was flushed and bristling his little body quivered like a machine from which the steam has just been turned off kate lifted a stricken glance stanwell read in it the reflexion of her brothers tirade but she held out her hand in silence for a moment caspar was silent too then with a terrible smile my dear fellow i congratulate you mungold will have to look to his laurels he said the shot delivered he stalked away with his sevenleague stride and kate moved tragically through the room in his wake v shepson took up his hat with a despairing gesture vell i gif you up i gif you up he said dont yet protested stanwell from the divan it was winter again and though the janitor had not forgotten the fire the studio gave no other evidence of its masters increasing prosperity if stanwell spent his money it was not upon himself he leaned back against the wall his hands in his pockets a cigarette between his lips while shepson paced the dirty floor or halted impatiently before an untouched canvas on the easel i tell you vat it is mr sdanwell i cant make you out he lamented last vinter you got a sdart that vould have kept most men going for years after making dat hit vith mrs millingtons picture you could have bainted half the town and here you are sitting on your divan and saying you cant make up your mind to take another order vell i can only say that if you take much longer to make it up youll find some other chap has cut in and got your job mrs van orley has been waiting since last august and she dells me you havent even answered her letter how could i i didnt know if i wanted to paint her my goodness dont you know if you vant three thousand tollars stanwell surveyed his cigarette no im not sure i do he said shepson flung out his hands ask more den but do it quick he exclaimed left to himself stanwell stood in silent contemplation of the canvas on which the dealer had riveted his reproachful gaze it had been destined to reflect the opulent image of mrs alpheus van orley but some secret reluctance of stanwells had stayed the execution of the task he had painted two of mrs millingtons friends in the spring had been much praised and liberally paid for his work and then declining several recent orders to be executed at newport had surprised his friends by remaining quietly in town it was not till august that he hired a little cottage on the new jersey coast and invited the arrans to visit him they accepted the invitation and the three had spent together six weeks of seashore idleness during which stanwells modest rafters shook with caspars denunciations of his hosts venality and the brightness of kates gratitude was tempered by a tinge of reproach but her grief over stanwells apostasy could not efface the fact that he had offered her brother the means of escape from town and stanwell himself was consoled by the reflection that but for mrs millingtons portrait he could not have performed even this trifling service for his friends when the arrans left him in september he went to pay a few visits in the country and on his return a month later to the studio building he found that things had not gone well with caspar the little sculptor had caught cold and the labour and expense of converting his gigantic offspring into marble seemed to hang heavily upon him he and kate were living in a damp company of amorphous clay monsters unfinished witnesses to the creative frenzy which had seized him after the sale of his group and the doctor had urged that his patient should be removed to warmer and drier lodgings but to uproot caspar was impossible and his sister could only feed the stove and swaddle him in mufflers and felt slippers stanwell found that during his absence mungold had reappeared fresh and rosy from a summer in europe and as prodigal as ever of the only form of attention which kate could be counted on not to resent the game and champagne reappeared with him and he seemed as ready as stanwell to lend a patient ear to caspars homilies but stanwell could see that even now kate had not forgiven him for the cupids stanwell himself had spent the early winter months in idleness the sight of his tools filled him with a strange repugnance and he absented himself as much as possible from the studio but shepsons visit roused him to the fact that he must decide on some definite course of action if he wished to follow up his success of the previous spring he must refuse no more orders he must not let mrs van orley slip away from him he knew there were competitors enough ready to profit by his hesitations and since his success was the result of a whim a whim might undo it with a sudden gesture of decision he caught up his hat and left the studio on the landing he met kate arran she too was going out drawn forth by the sudden radiance of the january afternoon she met him with a smile which seemed the answer to his uncertainties and he asked abruptly if she had time to take a walk with him yes for once she had time for mr mungold was sitting with caspar and had promised to remain till she came in it mattered little to stanwell that mungold was with caspar as long as he himself was with kate and he instantly soared to the suggestion that they should prolong the painters vigil by taking the elevated to the park in this too his companion acquiesced after a moment of surprise she seemed in a consenting mood and stanwell augured well from the fact the park was clothed in the double glitter of snow and sunshine they roamed the hard white alleys to a continuous tinkle of sleighbells and kate brightened with the exhilaration of the scene it was not often that she permitted herself such an escape from routine and in this new environment which seemed to detach her from her daily setting stanwell had his first complete vision of her to the girl also their unwonted isolation seemed to create a sense of fuller communion for she began presently as they reached the leafless solitude of the ramble to speak with sudden freedom of her brother it appeared that the orders against which caspar had so heroically steeled himself were slow in coming he had received no commission since the sale of his group and he was beginning to suffer from a reaction of discouragement oh it was not the craving for popularity stanwell knew how far above that he stood but it had been exquisite yes exquisite to him to find himself believed in understood he had fancied that the purchase of the group was the dawn of a tardy recognition and now the darkness of indifference had set in again no one spoke of him no one wrote of him no one cared if he were in good health it would not matter he would throw off such weakness he would live only for the joy of his work but he is losing ground his strength is failing and he is so afraid there will not be time enough left time enough for full recognition she explained the quiver in her voice silenced stanwell he was afraid of echoing it with his own at length he said oh more orders will come success is a gradual growth yes real success she said with a solemn note in which he caught and forgave a reflection on his own facile triumphs but when the orders do come she continued will he have strength to carry them out last winter the doctor thought he only needed work to set him up now he talks of rest instead he says we ought to go to a warm climate but how can caspar leave the group oh hang the group let him chuck the order cried stanwell she looked at him tragically the money is spent she said he coloured to the roots of his hair but illhealth illhealth excuses everything if he goes away now he will come back good for twice the amount of work in the spring a sculptor is not expected to deliver a statue on a given day like a package of groceries you must do as the doctor says you must make him chuck everything and go they had reached a windless nook above the lake and pausing in the stress of their talk she let herself sink on a bench beside the path the movement encouraged him and he seated himself at her side you must take him away at once he repeated urgently he must be made comfortable you must both be free from worry and i want you to let me manage it for you he broke off silenced by her rising blush her protesting murmur oh stop please let me explain im not talking of lending you money im talking of giving you myself the offer may be just as unacceptable but its of a kind to which its customary to accord it a hearing i should have made it a year ago the first day i saw you i believe but that then it wasnt in my power to make things easier for you but now you know ive had a little luck since i painted mrs millington things have changed i believe i can get as many orders as i choose there are two or three people waiting now whats the use of it all if it doesnt bring me a little happiness and the only happiness i know is the kind that you can give me he paused suddenly losing the courage to look at her so that her pained murmur was framed for him in a glittering vision of the frozen lake he turned with a start and met the refusal in her eyes no really no he repeated she shook her head silently i could have helped you i could have helped you he sighed she flushed distressfully but kept her eyes on his its just that dont you see she reproached him just that the fact that i could be of use to you the fact that as you say things have changed since you painted mrs millington i havent seen the later portraits but they tell me oh theyre just as bad stanwell jeered youve sold your talent and you know it thats the dreadful part you did it deliberately she cried with passion oh deliberately he interjected and youre not ashamed you talk of going on im not ashamed i talk of going on she received this with a long shuddering sigh and turned her eyes away from him oh why why why she lamented it was on the tip of stanwells tongue to answer that i might say to you what i am just saying now but he replied instead a man may paint bad pictures and be a decent fellow look at mungold after all the adjuration had an unexpected effect kates colour faded suddenly and she sat motionless with a stricken face theres a difference she began at length abruptly the difference youve always insisted on mr mungold paints as well as he can he has no idea that his pictures are less good than they might be well so he cant be accused of doing what he does for money of sacrificing anything better she turned on him with troubled eyes it was you who made me understand that when caspar used to make fun of him stanwell smiled im glad you still think me a better painter than mungold but isnt it hard that for that very reason i should starve in a hole if i painted badly enough youd see no objection to my living at the waldorf ah dont joke about it she murmured dont triumph in it i see no reason to at present said stanwell drily but i wont pretend to be ashamed when im not i think there are occasions when a man is justified in doing what ive done she looked at him solemnly what occasions why when he wants money hang it she drew a deep breath money money has caspars example been nothing to you then it hasnt proved to me that i must starve while mungold lives on truffles again her face changed and she stirred uneasily and then rose to her feet there is no occasion which can justify an artists sacrificing his convictions she exclaimed stanwell rose too facing her with a mounting urgency which sent a flush to his cheek cant you conceive such an occasion in my case the wish i mean to make things easier for caspar to help you in any way you might let me her face reflected his blush and she stood gazing at him with a wounded wonder caspar and i you imagine we could live on money earned in that way stanwell made an impatient gesture youve got to live on something or he has even if you dont include yourself her blush deepened miserably but she held her head high thats just it thats what i came here to say to you she stood a moment gazing away from him at the lake he looked at her in surprise you came here to say something to me yes that weve got to live on something caspar and i as you say and since an artist cannot sacrifice his convictions the sacrifice must i mean i wanted you to know that i have promised to marry mr mungold mungold stanwell cried with a sharp note of irony but her white look checked it on his lips i know all you are going to say she murmured with a kind of nobleness which moved him even through his sense of its grotesqueness but you must see the distinction because you first made it clear to me i can take money earned in good faith i can let caspar live on it i can marry mr mungold because though his pictures are bad he does not prostitute his art she began to move away from him slowly and he followed her in silence along the frozen path when stanwell reentered his studio the dusk had fallen he lit his lamp and rummaged out some writingmaterials having found them he wrote to shepson to say that he could not paint mrs van orley and did not care to accept any more orders for the present he sealed and stamped the letter and flung it over the banisters for the janitor to post then he dragged out his unfinished head of kate arran replaced it on the easel and sat down before it with a grim smile the best man i dusk had fallen and the circle of light shed by the lamp of governor mornways writingtable just rescued from the surrounding dimness his own imposing bulk thrown back in a deep chair in the lounging attitude habitual to him at that hour when the governor of midsylvania rested he rested completely five minutes earlier he had been bowed over his office desk an atlas with the state on his shoulders now his working hours over he had the air of a man who has spent his day in desultory pleasure and means to end it in the enjoyment of a good dinner this freedom from care threw into relief the hovering fidgetiness of his sister mrs nimick who just outside the circle of lamplight haunted the warm gloom of the hearth from which the wood fire now and then sent up an exploring flash into her face mrs nimicks presence did not usually minister to repose but the governors serenity was too deep to be easily disturbed and he felt the calmness of a man who knows there is a mosquito in the room but has drawn the netting close about his head this calmness reflected itself in the accent with which he said throwing himself back to smile up at his sister you know i am not going to make any appointments for a week it was the day after the great reform victory which had put john mornway for the second time at the head of his state a triumph compared with which even the mighty battle of his first election sank into insignificance and he leaned back with the sense of unassailable placidity which follows upon successful effort mrs nimick murmured an apology i didnt understand i saw in this mornings papers that the attorneygeneral was reappointed oh fleetwood his reappointment was involved in the campaign hes one of the principles i represent mrs nimick smiled a little tartly it seems odd to some people to think of mr fleetwood in connection with principles the governors smile had no answering acerbity the mention of his attorneygenerals name had set his blood humming with the thrill of the fight and he wondered how it was that fleetwood had not already been in to clasp hands with him over their triumph no he said goodhumoredly two years ago fleetwoods name didnt stand for principles of any sort but i believed in him and look what hes done for me i thought he was too big a man not to see in time that statesmanship is a finer thing than practical politics and now that ive given him a chance to make the discovery hes on the way to becoming just such a statesman as the country needs oh its a great deal easier and pleasanter to believe in people replied mrs nimick in a tone full of occult allusion and of course we all knew that mr fleetwood would have a hearing before any one else the governor took this imperturbably well at any rate he isnt going to fill all the offices in the state there will probably be one or two to spare after he has helped himself and when the time comes ill think over your man ill consider him mrs nimick brightened it would make sucha difference to jack it might mean anything to the poor boy to have mr ashford appointed the governor held up a warning hand oh i know one mustnt say that or at least you mustnt listen youre so dreadfully afraid of nepotism but im not asking for anything for jack i have never asked for a crust for any of us thank heaven no one can point to me mrs nimick checked herself suddenly and continued in a more impersonal tone but theres no harm surely in my saying a word for mr ashford when i know that hes actually under consideration and i dont see why the fact that jack is in his office should prevent my speaking on the contrary said the governor it implies on your part a personal knowledge of mr ashfords qualifications which may be of great help to me in reaching a decision mrs nimick never quite knew how to meet him when he took that tone and the flickering fire made her face for a moment the picture of uncertainty then at all hazards she launched out well i have ellas promise at any rate the governor sat upright ellas promise to back me up she thoroughly approves of him the governor smiled you talk as if ella had a political salonand distributed lettres de cachetim glad she approves of ashford but if you think my wife makes my appointments for me he broke off with a laugh at the superfluity of such a protest mrs nimick reddened one never knows how you will take the simplest thing what harm is there in my saying that ella approves of mr ashford i thought you liked her to take an interest in your work i like it immensely but i shouldnt care to have it take that form what form that of promising to use her influence to get people appointed but you always talk of politics in the vocabulary of european courts thank heaven ella has less imagination she has her sympathies of course but she doesnt think they can affect the distribution of offices mrs nimick gathered up her furs with an air at once crestfallen and resentful im sorry i always seem to say the wrong thing im sure i came with the best intentions its natural that your sister should want to be with you at such a happy moment of course it is my dear exclaimed the governor genially as he rose to grasp the hands with which she was nervously adjusting her wraps mrs nimick who lived a little way out of town and whose visits to her brother were apparently achieved at the cost of immense effort and mysterious complications had come to congratulate him on his victory and to sound him regarding the nomination to a coveted post of the lawyer in whose firm her eldest son was a clerk in the urgency of the latter errand she had rather lost sight of the former but her face softened as the governor keeping both her hands in his said in the voice which always seemed to put the most generous interpretation on her motives i was sure you would be one of the first to give me your blessing oh your success no one feels it more than i do sighed mrs nimick always at home in the emotional key i keep in the background i make no noise i claim no credit but whatever happens no one shall ever prevent my rejoicing in my brothers success mrs nimicks felicitations were always couched in the conditional with a sideglance at dark contingencies and the governor smiling at the familiar construction returned cheerfully i dont see why any one should want to deprive you of that privilege they couldnt they couldnt mrs nimick heroically affirmed well im in the saddle for another two years at any rate so you had better put in all the rejoicing you can whatever happens whatever happens cried mrs nimick melting on his bosom the only thing likely to happen at present is that you will miss your train if i let you go on saying nice things to me much longer mrs nimick at this dried her eyes renewed her clutch on her draperies and stood glancing sentimentally about the room while her brother rang for the carriage i take away a lovely picture of you she murmured its wonderful what youve made of this hideous house ah not i but ella there she doesreign undisputed he acknowledged following her glance about the library which wore an air of permanent habitation of slowly formed intimacy with its inmates in marked contrast to the gaudy impersonality of the usual executive apartment oh shes wonderful quite wonderful i see she has got those imported damask curtains she was looking at the other day at fieldings when i am asked how she does it all i always say its beyond me mrs nimick murmured its an art like another smiled the governor ella has been used to living in tents and she has the knack of giving them a wonderful look of permanence she certainly makes the most extraordinary bargains all the knack in the world wont take the place of such curtains and carpets are they good im glad to hear it but all the good curtains and carpets wont make a house comfortable to live in theres where the knack comes in you see he recalled with a shudder the lean congressional years the years before his marriage when mrs nimick had lived with him in washington and the daily struggle in the house had been combined with domestic conflicts almost equally recurrent the offer of a foreign mission though disconnecting him from active politics had the advantage of freeing him from his sisters tutelage and in europe where he remained for two years he had met the lady who was to become his wife mrs renfield was the widow of one of the diplomatists who languish in perpetual first secretaryship at our various embassies her life had given her ease without triviality and a sense of the importance of politics seldom found in ladies of her nationality she regarded a public life as the noblest and most engrossing of careers and combined with great social versatility an equal gift for reading bluebooks and studying debates so sincere was the latter taste that she passed without regret from the amenities of a european life well stocked with picturesque intimacies to the rawness of the midsylvanian capital she helped mornway in his fight for the governorship as a man likes to be helped by a woman by her tact her good looks her memory for faces her knack of saying the right thing to the right person and her capacity for obscure hard work in the background of his public activity but above all she helped him by making his private life smooth and harmonious for a man careless of personal ease mornway was singularly alive to the domestic amenities attentive service wellordered dinners brightly burning fires and a scent of flowers in the house these material details which had come to seem the extension of his wifes personality the inevitable result of her nearness were as agreeable to him after five years of marriage as in the first surprise of his introduction to them mrs nimick had kept house jerkily and vociferously ella performed the same task silently and imperceptibly and the results were all in favor of the latter method though neither the governor nor his wife had large means the household under mrs mornways guidance took on an air of sober luxury as agreeable to her husband as it was exasperating to her sisterinlaw the domestic machinery ran without a jar there were no upheavals no debts no squalid cookless hiatuses between intervals of showy hospitality the household moved along on lines of quiet elegance and comfort behind which only the eye of the housekeeping sex could have detected a gradually increasing scale of expense such an eye was now projected on the governors surroundings and its explorations were summed up in the tone in which mrs nimick repeated from the threshold i always say i dont see how she does it the tone did not escape the governor but it disturbed him no more than the buzz of a baffled insect poor grace it was not his fault if her husband was given to chimerical investments if her sons were unsatisfactory and her cooks would not stay with her but it was natural that these facts should throw into irritating contrast the ease and harmony of his own domestic life it made him all the sorrier for his sister to know that her envy did not penetrate to the essence of his happiness but lingered on those external signs of wellbeing which counted for so little in the sum total of his advantages poor mrs nimicks life seemed doubly thin and mean when one remembered that beneath its shabby surface there were no compensating riches of the spirit ii it was the custodian of his own hidden treasure who at this moment broke in upon his musings mrs mornway fresh from her afternoon walk entered the room with that air of ease and lightness which seemed to diffuse a social warmth about her fine slender pliant so polished and modeled by an intelligent experience of life that youth seemed clumsy in her presence she looked down at her husband and shook her head you promised to keep the afternoon to yourself and i hear grace has been here poor grace she didnt stay long and i should have been a brute not to see her he leaned back filling his gaze to the brim with her charming image which obliterated at a stroke the fretful ghost of mrs nimick she came to congratulate you i suppose yes and to ask me to do something for ashford ah on account of jack what does she want for him the governor laughed she said you were in her confidence that you were backing her up she seemed to think your support would ensure her success mrs mornway smiled her smile always full of delicate implications seemed to caress her husband while it gently mocked his sister poor grace i suppose you undeceived her as to your influence i told her it was paramount where it ought to be and where is that in the choice of carpets and curtains it seems ours are almost too good thanks for the compliment too good for what our station in life i suppose at least they seemed to bother grace poor grace ive always bothered her she paused removing her gloves reflectively and laying her long fine hands on his shoulders as she stood behind him then you dont believe in ashford feeling his slight start she drew away her hands and raised them to detach her veil what makes you think i dont believe in ashford he asked i asked out of curiosity i wondered whether you had decided anything no and i dont mean to for a week im dead beat and i want to bring a fresh mind to the question there is hardly one appointment im sure of except of course fleetwoods she turned away from him smoothing her hair in the mirror above the mantelpiece youre sure of that she asked after a moment of george fleetwood and poor grace thinks you are deep in my counsels i am as sure of reappointing fleetwood as i am that i have just been reelected myself ive never made any secret of the fact that if they wanted me back they must have him too you are tremendously generous she murmured generous what a strange word to use fleetwood is my trump card the one man i can count on to carry out my ideas through thick and thin she mused on this smiling a little thats why i call you generous when i remember how you disliked him two years ago what of that i was prejudiced against him i own or rather i had a just distrust of a man with such a past but how splendidly hes wiped it out what a record he has written on the new leaf he promised to turn over if i gave him the chance do you know the governor interrupted himself with a pleasantly reminiscent laugh i was rather annoyed with grace when she hinted that you had promised to back up ashford i told her you didnt aspire to distribute patronage but she might have reminded me if shed known that it wasyou who persuaded me to give fleetwood that chance mrs mornway turned with a slight heightening of color grace how could she possibly have known she couldnt of course unless shed read my weakness in my face but why do you look so startled at my little joke its only that i so dislike graces ineradicable idea that i am a wirepuller why should she imagine i would help her about ashford oh grace has always been a mild and ineffectual conspirator and she thinks every other woman is built on the same plan but you didget fleetwoods job for him you know he repeated with laughing insistence i had more faith than you in human nature thats all she paused a moment and then added personally you know i have always rather disliked him oh i never doubted your disinterestedness but you are not going to turn against your candidate are you she hesitated i am not sure circumstances alter cases when you made fleetwood attorneygeneral two years ago he was the inevitable man for the place well is there a better one now i dont say there is its not my business to look for him at any rate what i mean is that at that time fleetwood was worth risking anything for now i dont know that he is but even if he were not what do i risk for him now i dont see your point since he didnt cost me my reelection what can he possibly cost me now im in hes immensely unpopular he will cost you a great deal of popularity and you have never pretended to despise that no nor ever sacrificed anything essential to it are you really asking me to offer up fleetwood to it now i dont ask you to do anything except to consider if he isessential you said you were overtired and wanted to bring a fresh mind to bear on the other appointments why not delay this one too mornway turned in his chair and looked at her searchingly this means something ella what have you heard just what you have probably but with more attentive ears the very record you are so proud of has made george fleetwood innumerable enemies in the last two years the lead trust people are determined to ruin him and if his reappointment is attacked you will not be spared attacked in the papers you mean she paused you know the spy has always threatened a campaign and he has a past as you say which was public property long before i first appointed him nothing could be gained by raking up his old political history everybody knows he didnt come to me with clean hands but to hurt him now the spy would have to fasten a new scandal on him and that would not be easy it would be easy to invent one unproved accusations dont count much against a man of such proved capacity the best answer is his record of the last two years that is what the public looks at the public looks wherever the press points and besides you have your own future to consider it would be a pity to sacrifice such a career as yours for the sake of backing up even as useful a man as george fleetwood she paused as if checked by his gathering frown but went on with fresh decision oh im not speaking of personal ambition im thinking of the good you can do will fleetwoods reappointment secure the greatest good of the greatest number if his unpopularity reacts on you to the extent of hindering your career the governors brow cleared and he rose with a smile my dear your reasoning is admirable but we must leave my career to take care of itself whatever i may be tomorrow i am governor of midsylvania today and my business as governor is to appoint as attorneygeneral the best man i can find for the place and that man is george fleetwood unless you have a better one to propose she met this with perfect goodhumor no i have told you already that that is not my business but i havea candidate of my own for another office so grace was not quite wrong after all well who is your candidate and for what office i only hope you dont want to change cooks oh i do that without your authority and you never even know it has been done she hesitated and then said with a bright directness i want you to do something for poor gregg gregg rufus gregg he stared what an extraordinary request what can i do for a man ive had to kick out for dishonesty not much perhaps i know its difficult but after all it was your kicking him out that ruined him it was his dishonesty that ruined him he was getting a good salary as my stenographer and if he hadnt sold those letters to the spy he would have been getting it still she wavered after all nothing was proved he always denied it good heavens ella have you ever doubted his guilt no no i dont mean that but of course his wife and children believe in him and think you were cruel and he has been out of work so long that they are starving send them some money then i wonder you thought it necessary to ask i shouldnt have thought it so but money is not what i want mrs gregg is proud and it is hard to help her in that way couldnt you give him work of some kind just a little post in a corner my dear child the little posts in the corner are just the ones where honesty is essential a footpad doesnt wait under a streetlamp besides how can i recommend a man whom i have dismissed for theft i wont say a word to hinder his getting a place but on my conscience i cant give him one she paused and turned toward the door silently though without any show of resentment but on the threshold she lingered long enough to say yet you gave fleetwood his chance fleetwood you class fleetwood with gregg the best man in the state with a little beggarly thieving nonentity its evident enough youre new at wirepulling or you would show more skill at it she met this with a laugh im not likely to have much practice if my first attempt is such a failure well i will see if mrs gregg will let me help her a little i suppose there is nothing else to be done nothing that we can do if gregg wants a place he had better get one on the staff of the spy he served them better than he did me iii the governor stared at the card with a frown half an hour had elapsed since his wife had gone upstairs to dress for the big dinner from which official duties excused him and he was still lingering over the fire before preparing for his own solitary meal he expected no one that evening but his old friend hadley shackwell with whom it was his longestablished habit to talk over his defeats and victories in the first lull after the conflict and shackwell was not likely to turn up till nine oclock the unwonted stillness of the room and the knowledge that he had a quiet evening before him filled the governor with a luxurious sense of repose the world seemed to him a good place to be in and his complacency was shadowed only by the fear that he had perhaps been a trifle overharsh in refusing his wifes plea for the stenographer there seemed therefore a certain fitness in the appearance of the mans card and the governor with a sigh gave orders that gregg should be shown in gregg was still the softstepping scoundrel who invited the toe of honesty and mornway as he entered was conscious of a sharp revulsion of feeling but it was impossible to evade the interview and he sat silent while the man stated his case mrs mornway had represented the stenographer as being in desperate straits and ready to accept any job that could be found but though his appearance might have seemed to corroborate her account he evidently took a less hopeless view of his case and the governor found with surprise that he had fixed his eye on a clerkship in one of the government offices a post which had been half promised him before the incident of the letters his plea was that the governors charge though unproved had so injured his reputation that he could only hope to clear himself by getting some sort of small job under the administration after that it would be easy for him to obtain any employment he wanted he met mornways refusal with civility but remarked after a moment i hadnt expected this governor mrs mornway led me to think that something might be arranged the governors tone was brief mrs mornway is sorry for your wife and children and for their sake would be glad to find work for you but she could not have led you to think that there was any chance of your getting a clerkship well thats just it she said she thought she could manage it you have misinterpreted my wifes interest in your family mrs mornway has nothing to do with the distribution of government offices the governor broke off annoyed to find himself asseverating for the second time so obvious a fact there was a moments silence then gregg said still in a perfectly equable tone youve always been hard on me governor but i dont bear malice you accused me of selling those letters to the spy the governor made an impatient gesture you couldnt prove your case gregg went on imperturbably but you were right in one respect i wason confidential terms with the spy he paused and glanced at mornway whose face remained immovable im on the same terms with them still and im ready to let you have the benefit of it if youll give methe chance to retrieve my good name in spite of his irritation the governor could not repress a smile in other words you will do a dirty trick for me if i undertake to convince people that you are the soul of honor gregg smiled also there are always two ways of putting a thing why not call it a plain case of give and take i want something and can pay for it not in any coin i have a use for said mornway pushing back his chair gregg hesitated then he said perhaps you dont mean to reappoint fleetwood the governor was silent and he continued if you do dont kick me out a second time im not threatening you im speaking as a friend mrs mornway has been kind to my wife and id like to help her the governor rose gripping his chairback sternly you will be kind enough to leave my wifes name out of the discussion i supposed you knew me well enough to know that i dont buy newspaper secrets at any price least of all at that of the public money gregg who had risen also stood a few feet off looking at him inscrutably is that final governor quite final well good evening then iv shackwell and the governor sat over the evening embers it was after ten oclock and the servant had carried away the coffee and liqueurs leaving the two men to their cigars mornway had once more lapsed into his armchair and sat with outstretched feet gazing comfortably at his friend shackwell was a small dry man of fifty with a face as sallow and freckled as a winter pear a limp mustache and shrewd melancholy eyes i am glad you have given yourself a days rest he said looking at the governor well i dont know that i needed it theres such exhilaration in victory that i never felt fresher ah but the fights just beginning i know but im ready for it you mean the campaign against fleetwood i understand there is to be a big row well he and i are used to rows shackwell paused surveying his cigar you knew the spy meant to lead the attack yes i was offered a glimpse of the documents this afternoon shackwell started up you didnt refuse mornway related the incident of greggs visit i could hardly buy my information at that price he said and besides it is really fleetwoods business this time i suppose he has heard the report but it doesnt seem to bother him i rather thought he would have looked in today to talk things over but i havent seen him shackwell continued to twist his cigar through his sallow fingers without remembering to light it youre determined to reappoint fleetwood he asked at length the governor caught him up youre the fourth person who has asked me that today you havent lost faith in him have you hadley not an atom said the other with emphasis well then what are you all thinking of to suppose i can be frightened by a little newspaper talk besides if fleetwood is not afraid why should i be because youll be involved in it with him the governor laughed what have they got against me now shackwell standing up confronted his friend solemnly this that fleetwood bought his appointment two years ago ah bought it of me why didnt it come out at the time because it wasnt known then it has only been found out lately known found out this is magnificent what was my price and what did i do with the money shackwell glanced about the room and his eyes returned to mornways face look here john fleetwood is not the only man in the world the only man the only attorneygeneral the spy has the lead trust behind it and means to put up a savage fight mud sticks and hadley is this a conspiracy youre saying to me just what ella said this afternoon at the mention of mrs mornways name a silence fell between the two men and the governor moved uneasily in his chair you are not advising me to chuck fleetwood because the spy is going to accuse me of having sold him his first appointment he said at length shackwell drew a deep breath you say yourself that mrs mornway gave you the same advice this afternoon well what of that do you imagine that my wife distrib the governor broke off with an exasperated laugh shackwell leaning against the mantelpiece looked down into the embers i didnt say the spy meant to accuse youof having sold the office mornway stood up slowly his eyes on his friends averted face the ashes dropped from his cigar scattering a white trail across the carpet which had excited mrs nimicks envy the office is in my gift if i didnt sell it who did he demanded shackwell laid a hand on his arm for heavens sake john who did who did the governor violently repeated the two men faced each other in the closely curtained silence of the dim luxurious room shackwells eyes again wandered as if summoning the walls to reply then he said i have positive information that the spy will say nothing if you dont appoint fleetwood and what will it say if i do appoint him that he bought his first appointment from your wife the governor stood silent immovable while the blood crept slowly from his strong neck to his lowering brows once he laughed then he set his lips and continued to gaze into the fire after a while he looked at his cigar and shook the freshly formed cone of ashes carefully upon the hearth he had just turned again to shackwell when the door opened and the butler announced mr fleetwood the room swam about shackwell and when he recovered himself mornway with outstretched hand was advancing quietly to meet his guest fleetwood was a smaller man than the governor he was erect and compact with a face full of dry energy which seemed to press forward with the spring of his prominent features as though it were the weapon with which he cleared his way through the world he was in evening dress scrupulously appointed but pale and nervous of the two men it was mornway who was the more composed i thought i should have seen you before this he said fleetwood returned his grasp and shook hands with shackwell i knew you needed to be let alone i didnt mean to come tonight but i wanted to say a word to you at this shackwell who had fallen into the background made a motion of leavetaking but the governor arrested it we havent any secrets from hadley have we fleetwood certainly not i am glad to have him stay i have simply come to say that i have been thinking over my future arrangements and that i find it will not be possible for me to continue in office there was a long pause during which shackwell kept his eyes on mornway the governor had turned pale but when he spoke his voice was full and firm this is sudden he said fleetwood stood leaning against a high chairback fretting its carved ornaments with restless fingers it is sudden yes i there are a variety of reasons is one of them the fact that you are afraid of what the spy is going to say the attorneygeneral flushed deeply and moved away a few steps im sick of mudthrowing he muttered george fleetwood mornway exclaimed he had advanced toward his friend and the two stood confronting each other already oblivious of shackwells presence its not only that of course ive been frightfully hardworked my health has given way since yesterday fleetwood forced a smile my dear fellow what a slavedriver you are hasnt a man the right to take a rest not a soldier on the eve of battle you have never failed me before i dont want to fail you now but it isnt the eve of battle youre in and thats the main thing the main thing at present is that you promised to stay in with me and that i must have your real reason for breaking your word fleetwood made a deprecatory movement my dear governor if you only knew it im doing you a service in backing out a service why because im hated because the lead trust wants my blood and will have yours too if you appoint me ah thats the real reason then youre afraid of the spy afraid the governor continued to speak with dry deliberation evidently then you know what they mean to say fleetwood laughed one neednt do that to be sure it will be abominable who cares how abominable it is if it isnt true fleetwood shrugged his shoulders and was silent shackwell from a distant seat uttered a faint protesting sound but no one heeded him the governor stood squarely before fleetwood his hands in his pockets it istrue then he demanded what is true what the spy means to say that you bought my wifes influence to get your first appointment in the silence shackwell started suddenly to his feet a sound of carriagewheels had disturbed the quiet street they paused and then rolled up the semicircle to the door of the executive mansion john shackwell warned him the governor turned impatiently there was the sound of a servants steps in the hall followed by the opening and closing of the outer door your wife mrs mornway shackwell cried another step accompanied by a soft rustle of skirts was advancing toward the library my wife let her come said the governor v she stood before them in her bright evening dress with an arrested brilliancy of aspect like the sparkle of a fountain suddenly caught in ice her look moved rapidly from one to the other then she came forward while shackwell slipped behind her to close the door what has happened she said shackwell began to speak but the governor interposed calmly fleetwood has come to tell me that he does not wish to remain in office ah she murmured there was another silence fleetwood broke it by saying it is getting late if you want to see me tomorrow the governor looked from his face to ellas yes go now he said shackwell moved in fleetwoods wake to the door mrs mornway stood with her head high smiling slightly she shook hands with each of the men in turn then she moved toward the sofa and laid aside her shining cloak all her gestures were calm and noble but as she raised her hand to unclasp the cloak her husband uttered a sudden exclamation where did you get that bracelet i dont remember it this she looked at him with astonishment it belonged to my mother i dont often wear it ah i shall suspect everything now he groaned he turned away and flung himself with bowed head in the chair behind his writingtable he wanted to collect himself to question her to get to the bottom of the hideous abyss over which his imagination hung but what was the use what did the facts matter he had only to put his memories together they led him straight to the truth every incident of the day seemed to point a leering finger in the same direction from mrs nimicks allusion to the imported damask curtains to greggs confident appeal for rehabilitation if you imagine that my wife distributes patronage he heard himself repeating inanely and the walls seemed to reverberate with the laughter which his sister and gregg had suppressed he heard ella rise from the sofa and lifted his head sharply sit still he commanded she sank back without speaking and he hid his face again the past months the past years were dancing a witches dance about him he remembered a hundred significant things oh god he cried to himself if only she does not lie about itsuddenly he recalled having pitied mrs nimick because she could not penetrate to the essence of his happiness those were the very words he had used he heard himself laugh aloud the clock struck it went on striking interminably at length he heard his wife rise again and say with sudden authority john you must speak authority she spoke to him with authority he laughed again and through his laugh he heard the senseless rattle of the words if you imagine that my wife distributes patronage he looked up haggardly and saw her standing before him if only she would not lie about it he said you see what has happened i suppose some one has told you about the spy who told you gregg he interposed yes she said quietly that was why you wanted why i wanted you to help him yes oh god he wouldnt take money no he wouldnt take money he sat silent looking at her noting with a morbid minuteness the exquisite finish of her dress that finish which seemed so much a part of herself that it had never before struck him as a merely purchasable accessory he knew so little what a womans dresses cost for a moment he lost himself in vague calculations finally he said what did you do it for do what take money from fleetwood she paused a moment and then said if you will let me explain and then he saw that all along he had thought she would be able to disprove it a smothering blackness closed in on him and he had a physical struggle for breath then he forced himself to his feet and said he was your lover oh no no no she cried with conviction he hardly knew whether the shadow lifted or deepened the fact that he instantly believed her seemed only to increase his bewilderment presently he found that she was still speaking and he began to listen to her catching a phrase now and then through the deafening clamor of his thoughts it amounted to this that just after her husbands first election when fleetwoods claims for the attorneygeneralship were being vainly pressed by a group of his political backers mrs mornway had chanced to sit next to him once or twice at dinner one day on the strength of these meetings he had called and asked her frankly if she would not help him with her husband he had made a clean breast of his past but had said that under a man like mornway he felt he could wipe out his political sins and purify himself while he served the party she knew the party needed his brains and she believed in him she was sure he would keep his word she would have spoken in his favor in any case she would have used all her influence to overcome her husbands prejudice and it was by a mere accident that in the course of one of their talks he happened to give her a tip his past connections were still useful for such purposes a tip which in the first invading pressure of debt after mornways election she had not had the courage to refuse fleetwood had made some money for her yes about thirty thousand dollars she had repaid what he had lent her and there had been no further transactions of the kind between them but it appeared that gregg before his dismissal had got hold of an old checkbook which gave a hint of the story and had pieced the rest together with the help of a clerk in fleetwoods office the spy was in possession of the facts but did not mean to use them if fleetwood was not reappointed the lead trust having no personal grudge against mornway her story ended there and she sat silent while he continued to look at her so much had perished in the wreck of his faith that he did not attach much value to what remained it scarcely mattered that he believed her when the truth was so sordid there had been after all nothing to envy him for but what mrs nimick had seen the core of his life was as mean and miserable as his sisters his wife rose at length pale but still calm she had a kind of external dignity which she wore like one of her rich dresses it seemed as little a part of her now as the finery of which his gaze contemptuously reckoned the cost john she said laying her hand on his shoulder he looked up wearily you had better go to bed he interjected dont look at me in that way i am prepared for your being angry with me i made a dreadful mistake and must bear my punishment any punishment you choose to inflict but you must think of yourself first you must spare yourself why should you be so horribly unhappy dont you see that since mr fleetwood has behaved so well we are quite safe and i swear to you i have paid back every penny of the money vi three days later shackwell was summoned by telephone to the governors office in the capitol there had been in the interval no communication between the two men and the papers had been silent or noncommittal in the lobby shackwell met fleetwood leaving the building for a moment the attorneygeneral seemed about to speak then he nodded and passed on leaving to shackwell the impression of a face more than ever thrust forward like a weapon the governor sat behind his desk in the clear autumn sunlight in contrast to fleetwood he seemed relaxed and unwieldy and the face he turned to his friend had a gray look of convalescence shackwell wondered with a start of apprehension if he and fleetwood had been together he relieved himself of his overcoat without speaking and when he turned again toward mornway he was surprised to find the latter watching him with a smile its good to see you hadley the governor said i waited to be sent for i knew youd let me know when you wanted me shackwell replied i didnt send for you on purpose if i had i might have asked your advice and i didnt want to ask anybodys advice but my own the governor spoke steadily but in a voice a trifle too well disciplined to be natural ive had a three days conference with myself he continued and now that everything is settled i want you to do me a favor yes shackwell assented the private issues of the affair were still wrapped in mystery to him but he had never had a moments doubt as to its public solution and he had no difficulty in conjecturing the nature of the service he was to render his heart ached for mornway but he was glad the inevitable step was to be taken without further delay everything is settled the governor repeated and i want you to notify the press that i have decided to reappoint fleetwood shackwell bounded from his seat good heavens he ejaculated to reappoint fleetwood the governor repeated because at the present juncture of affairs he is the only man for the place the work we began together is not finished and i cant finish it without him remember the vistas opened by the lead trust investigation he knows where they lead and no one else does we must put that inquiry through no matter what it costs us and that is why i have sent for you to take this letter to the spy shackwells hand drew back from the proffered envelope you say you dont want my advice but you cant expect me to go on such an errand with my eyes shut what on earth are you driving at of course fleetwood will persist in refusing mornway smiled he did persist for three hours but when he left here just now he had given me his word to accept shackwell groaned then i am dealing with two madmen instead of one the governor laughed my poor hadley youre worse than i expected i thought you would understand me understand you how can i in heavens name when i dont understand the situation the situation the situation mornway repeated slowly whose his or mine i dont either i havent had time to think of them what on earth have you been thinking of then the governor rose with a gesture toward the window through which below the slope of the capitol grounds the roofs and steeples of the city spread their smoky mass to the mild air of all that is left he said of everything except fleetwood and myself ah shackwell murmured mornway turned back and sank into his seat dont you see that was all i had to turn to the state the country its big enough in all conscience to fill a good deal of a void my own walls had grown too cramped for me so i just stepped outside you have no idea how it simplified matters at once all i had to do was to say to myself go ahead and do the best you can for the country the personal issue simply didnt exist yes and then then i turned over for three days this question of the attorneygeneralship i couldnt see that it was changed how should myfeelings have affected it fleetwood hasnt betrayed the state there isnt a scar on his public record he is still the best man for the place my business is to appoint the best man i can find and i cant find any one as good as fleetwood but but your wife shackwell stammered the governor looked up with surprise shackwell could almost have sworn that he had indeed forgotten the private issue my wife is ready to face the consequences he said shackwell returned to his former attitude of incredulity but fleetwood fleetwood has no right to sacrifice to sacrifice my wife to the state oh let us beware of big words fleetwood was inclined to use them at first but i managed to restore his sense of proportion i showed him that our private lives are only a few feet square anyhow and that really to breathe freely one must get out of them into the open he paused and broke out with sudden violence my god hadley didnt you see that fleetwood had to obey me yes i see that said shackwell with reviving obstinacy but if youve reached such a height and pulled him up to your side it seems to me that from that standpoint you ought to get an even clearer view of the madness of your position you say you have decided to sacrifice your own feelings and your wifes though im not so sure of your right to dispose of hervoice in the matter but what if you sacrifice the party and the state as well in this transcendental attempt to distinguish between private and public honor youll have to answer that before you can get me to carry this letter the governor did not blanch under the attack i think the letter will answer you he said calmly the letter yes its something more than a notification of fleetwoods reappointment mornway paused and looked steadily at his friend youre afraid of an investigation an impeachment well the letter anticipates that how in heavens name by a plain statement of the facts my wife has told me that she did borrow of fleetwood he speculated for her and made a considerable sum out of which she repaid his loan the spys accusation is true if it can be proved that my wife induced me to appoint fleetwood it may be argued that she sold him the appointment but it cant be proved and the spy wont waste its breath in trying to because my statement will take the sting out of its innuendoes i propose to anticipate its attack by setting forth the facts in its columns and asking the public to decide between us on one side is the private fact that my wife without my knowledge borrowed money from fleetwood just before i appointed him to an important post on the other side is his public record and mine i want people to see both sides and judge between them not in the red glare of a newspaper denunciation but in the plain daylight of commonsense charges against the private morality of a public man are usually made in such a blare of headlines and cloud of mudthrowing that the voice he lifts up in his defence can not make itself heard in this case i want the public to hear what i have to say before the yelping begins my letter will take the wind out of the spys sails and if the verdict goes against me the case will have been decided on its own merits and not at the dictation of the writers of scare heads even if i dont gain my end it will be a good thing for once for the public to consider dispassionately how far a private calamity should be allowed to affect a career of public usefulness and the next man who goes through what i am undergoing may have cause to thank me if no one else does shackwell sat silent for a moment with the ring of the last words in his ears suddenly he rose and held out his hand give me the letter he said the governor caught him up with a kindling eye its all right then you see and youll take it shackwell met his glance with one of melancholy interrogation i think i see a magnificent suicide but its the kind of way i shouldnt mind dying myself he pulled himself silently into his coat and put the letter into one of its pockets but as he was turning to the door the governor called after him cheerfully by the way hadley arent you and mrs shackwell giving a big dinner tomorrow shackwell paused with a start i believe we are why because if there is room for two more my wife and i would like to be invited shackwell nodded his assent and turned away without answering as he came out of the lobby into the clear sunset radiance he saw a victoria drive up the long sweep to the capitol and pause before the central portion he descended the steps and mrs mornway leaned from her furs to greet him i have called for my husband she said smiling he promised to get away in time for a little turn in the park before dinner
