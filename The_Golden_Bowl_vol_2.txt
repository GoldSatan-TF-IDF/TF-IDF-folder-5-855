the golden bowl volume ii book second the princess part fourth xxv it was not till many days had passed that the princess began to accept the idea of having done a little something she was not always doing or indeed that of having listened to any inward voice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctive postponements of reflection were the fruit positively of recognitions and perceptions already active of the sense above all that she had made at a particular hour made by the mere touch of her hand a difference in the situation so long present to her as practically unattackable this situation had been occupying for months and months the very centre of the garden of her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard bright porcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhanging eaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly when stirred by chance airs she had walked round and round it that was what she felt she had carried on her existence in the space left her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample and sometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fair structure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but never quite making out as yet where she might have entered had she wished she had not wished till now such was the odd case and what was doubtless equally odd besides was that though her raised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve from within and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks no door appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistently impenetrable and inscrutable at present however to her considering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circle and to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplessly to stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the act of pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that of stepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by the distance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which no base heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it the vision of ones putting off ones shoes to enter and even verily of ones paying with ones life if found there as an interloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception of paying with her life for anything she might do but it was nevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one of the rare porcelain plates she had knocked in short though she could scarce have said whether for admission or for what she had applied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see what would happen something had happened it was as if a sound at her touch after a little had come back to her from within a sound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted if this image however may represent our young womans consciousness of a recent change in her life a change now but a few days old it must at the same time be observed that she both sought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it a measure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer for what she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured the arrangement how otherwise was it to be named by which so strikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as she liked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself to her husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition and yet she had not all the while given up her father the least little inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the two men beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriage had marked it as more happy than this fact of its having practically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what had moreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success was that the latters marriage had been no more meassurably paid for than her own his having taken the same great step in the same free way had not in the least involved the relegation of his daughter that it was remarkable they should have been able at once so to separate and so to keep together had never for a moment from however far back been equivocal to her that it was remarkable had in fact quite counted at first and always and for each of them equally as part of their inspiration and their support there were plenty of singular things they were not enamoured of flights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not at all in their line but they liked to think they had given their life this unusual extension and this liberal form which many families many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had been distinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony the quite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarked to them again and again that they must on all the showing to keep on such terms be people of the highest amiability equally including in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it had given them pleasure as how should it not to find themselves shed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure to her father and herself both of them distinguishably of a nature so slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of their triumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was that their felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the social field had risen stage by stage maggies actual reluctance to ask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased to take comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapse from that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost at any time depended to remain consistent she had always been capable of cutting down more or less her prior term moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadow of a false position she reflected that she should either not have ceased to be right that is to be confident or have recognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal with herself for a space only as a silkencoated spaniel who has scrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much of that order and she had the resource to which save for the rude equivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have been a stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had happened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had had no accident and had not got wet this at any rate was her pretension until after she began a little to wonder if she mightnt with or without exposure have taken cold she could at all events remember no time at which she had felt so excited and certainly none which was another special point that so brought with it as well the necessity for concealing excitement this birth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping the thing born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private and absorbing exercise in the light of which might i so far multiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened but clinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that had possession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of her misadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of a relation that was more to her than anything on earth she had lived long enough to make out for herself that any deepseated passion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are made by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it she had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her to her husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it had begun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a strain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the full privilege of passion why in the world shouldnt she with every right if on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility of some consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by the egotism of their passions but if once that danger were duly guarded against the fulness of ones measure amounted to no more than the equal use of ones faculties or the proper playing of ones part it had come to the princess obscurely at first but little by little more conceivably that her faculties had not for a good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in a manner that of her onceloved dancing a matter of remembered steps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls she would go to balls again that seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles in which she had laid them away the various ornaments congruous with the greater occasions and of which her store she liked to think was none of the smallest she would have been easily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at off moments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughty candlelight into her rich collections and seeing her jewels again a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in fact may pass as the very picture of her semismothered agitation of the diversion she to some extent successfully found in referring her crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of her own needs it must be added however that she would have been at a loss to determine and certainly at first to which order that of selfcontrol or that of large expression the step she had taken the afternoon of her husbands return from matcham with his companion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggies part her deciding to do something just then and there which would strike amerigo as unusual and this even though her departure from custom had merely consisted in her so arranging that he wouldnt find her as he would definitely expect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get the impression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatiently and independently awaiting him these were small variations and mild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggies part as we have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention her watching by his fireside for her husbands return from an absence might superficially have presented itself as the most natural act in the world and the only one into the bargain on which he would positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance into the order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which it was in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the fact that she had done with it all she had designed she had put her thought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this was what was before her that she was no longer playing with blunt and idle tools with weapons that didnt cut there passed across her vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at this it was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse to cheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on a certain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining in eaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seen the mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over so commonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened it had been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing she had ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for her perhaps not even what she had done in accepting in their old golden rome amerigos proposal of marriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that of a timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names the invidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her own ridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what had followed it she had but wanted to get nearer nearer to something indeed that she couldnt that she wouldnt even to herself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness was what had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplication of distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failed to prevent her living over again any chosen minute for she could choose them she could fix them of the freshness of relation produced by her having administered to her husband the first surprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poor thing but it had been all her own and the whole passage was backwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her daily life for her to make what she would of it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that were watchable still almost in the manner of the different things done during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to have left a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and those she could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on a string had belonged more particularly to the lapse of time before dinner dinner which had been so late quite at nine oclock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigos own advent these were parts of the experience though in fact there had been a good many of them between which her impression could continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequent passages much later on it was to be said the flame of memory turned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some sidechapel in which incense was thick the great moment at any rate for conscious repossession was doubtless the first the strange little timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot as altogether beyond her own intention but which for just how long should she ever really know for just how long she could do nothing to break she was in the smaller drawingroom in which she always sat and she had by calculation dressed for dinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things she had calculated in respect to this small incident a matter for the importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure he would be late he would be very late that was the one certainty that seemed to look her in the face there was still also the possibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eaton square he might think it best to remain there even on learning she had come away she had left no message for him on any such chance this was another of her small shades of decision though the effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent he might suppose she would already have dined he might stay with all he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to her father she had known him to stretch the point to these beautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretched it to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had made herself during the time at her disposal quite inordinately fresh and quite positively smart this had probably added while she waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in which she was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched she did her best quite intensely by herself to banish any such appearance she couldnt help it if she couldnt read her pale novel ah that par exemple was beyond her but she could at least sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newest frock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and too grand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none the less this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsic merit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she had refused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on the polished floor with the rustle and the hang still more beautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also make her feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactly what she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety had been when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to the front of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder if it would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been in respect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for the last year above all she had lived in the light of charlottes possible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlottes own were simply the most charming and interesting that any woman had ever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being at last able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite to omnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would have described herself as in these connections constantly and intimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility of copying her companion and conscious on the other of the impossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave without having known how charlotte after all had been said really thought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingenious personal experiment she had always been lovely about the stepdaughters material braveries had done for her the very best with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back of maggies head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadnt charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopeless hopeless by a serious standard and thereby invented for her a different and inferior one in which as the only thing to be done she patiently and soothingly abetted her hadnt she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation to her being ridiculous so that the best now possible was to wonder once in a great while whether one mightnt give her the surprise of something a little less out of the true note than usual something of this kind was the question that maggie while the absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she was endeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begun more and more to hang for our young woman over her accumulations of the unanswered they were there these accumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had been passing and repassing along the corridor of her life she passed it when she could without opening the door then on occasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution so it was that she had been getting things out of the way they rejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found their place by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew in short where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense of method and experience what she should never know about charlottes thought she tossed that in it would find itself in company and she might at last have been standing there long enough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover would doubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vague gasp turn away and what had further determined this was the final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward the quite different door had opened and her husband was there it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to think it it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend in her life he had come back had followed her from the other house visibly uncertain this was written in the face he for the first minute showed her it had been written only for those seconds and it had appeared to go quickly after they began to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didnt quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadnt expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassment she called it embarrassment so as to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishably wishing to see how he should find her why first that had later on kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it were the key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she had felt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she must instantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyond what she had intended it was in fact even at the moment not absent from her view that he might easily have made an abject fool of her at least for the time she had indeed for just ten seconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in his face had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the very air three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreak of what in the world are you up to and what do you mean any note of that sort would instantly have brought her low and this all the more that heaven knew she hadnt in any manner designed to be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitude of wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadow of it the effect of a complication it had made for him some difference that she couldnt measure this meeting him at home and alone instead of elsewhere and with others and back and back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed her before he was able to see might should she choose to insist on it have a meaning have as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general she had naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he might want to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of a beating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her own drawingroom at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadnt in any way challenged her it was true and after those instants during which she now believed him to have been harbouring the impression of something unusually prepared and pointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon her smiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at the first and she at present saw that he had surmounted it without her help she had given him no help for if on the one hand she couldnt speak for hesitation so on the other and especially as he didnt ask her she couldnt explain why she was agitated she had known it all the while down to her toes known it in his presence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but a question it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say to him should have had that appearance but she was more than ever conscious that any appearance she had would come round more or less straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on the basis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousness even in the possible sense of enlivenment would make their precious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it was practically precarious a matter of a hairs breadth for the loss of the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events her conscious fear about it that had brought her heart into her mouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent look she and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demanded this amount of consideration was truly thus as by its own confession a delicate matter but that her husband had also his habit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them after all more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joy at their feeling so exactly the same about it that she might have spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of her behaviour to ring out on the subject of that poor little behaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case of eccentricity why why have i made this evening such a point of our not all dining together well because ive all day been so wanting you alone that i finally couldnt bear it and that there didnt seem any great reason why i should try to that came to me funny as it may at first sound with all the things weve so wonderfully got into the way of bearing for each other youve seemed these last days i dont know what more absent than ever before too absent for us merely to go on so its all very well and i perfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes a day when something snaps when the full cup filled to the very brim begins to flow over thats what has happened to my need of you the cup all day has been too full to carry so here i am with it spilling it over you and just for the reason that is the reason of my life after all ive scarcely to explain that im as much in love with you now as the first hour except that there are some hours which i know when they come because they almost frighten me that show me im even more so they come of themselves and ah theyve been coming after all after all some such words as those were what didnt ring out yet it was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here in its own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down by its very weight if he had let it get so far without that extremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he needed to take that his wife was testifying that she adored and missed and desired him after all after all since she put it so she was right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treat as the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunion this obviously was one way of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deep vague murmur against her face that side of her face she was not pressing to his breast that was not less obviously another way and there were ways enough in short for his extemporised ease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herself thinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up at the end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberally talked and she had genially questioned he had told her of his day the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedralhunting adventure and how it had turned out rather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath and dress to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortest time possible she was to remember afterwards something that had passed between them on this how he had looked for her during an instant at the door before going out how he had met her asking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldnt help him by going up with him he had perhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined her offer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smile with which he had opined that at that rate they wouldnt dine till ten oclock and that he should go straighter and faster alone such things as i say were to come back to her they played through her full aftersense like lights on the whole impression the subsequent parts of the experience were not to have blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her later and more analytic consciousness of this second wait for her husbands reappearance she might certainly with the best will in the world had she gone up with him have been more in his way than not since people could really almost always hurry better without help than with it still she could actually hardly have made him take more time than he struck her taking though it must indeed be added that there was now in this muchthinking little persons state of mind no mere crudity of impatience something had happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and with the drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go to and fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggies spirit was always at first positive emergence of the sweet and it was long since anything had been so sweet to her as the particular quality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense of possession xxvi amerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walked there without him for she had with the difference of his presence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of his nearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacy so established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of his aspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he had stood there before her as if restored from some far country some long voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues this unquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did it mean but that reduced to the flatness of mere statement she was married by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person that was an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her like the beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of an ancestor that she might have been looking at almost in surprise after a long intermission the dazzling person was upstairs and she was down and there were moreover the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration of her own had required and of the constant care that the equilibrium involved but she had all the same never felt so absorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of her fate he could do what he would with her in fact what was actually happening was that he was actually doing it what he would what he really would only that quantity itself escaped perhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar naming and discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutely bring it off she knew at this moment without a question with the fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarce more than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness if he had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion had been literally in her service and her fathers they two had sat at home at peace the principino between them the complications of life kept down the bores sifted out the large ease of the home preserved because of the way the others held the field and braved the weather amerigo never complained any more than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to see tonight as she had never yet quite done that their business of social representation conceived as they conceived it beyond any conception of her own and conscientiously carried out was an affair of living always in harness she remembered fanny assinghams old judgment that friends description of her father and herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do or what might be done for them and there came back to her with it an echo of the long talk they had had together one september day at fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum of fannys that occasion might have counted for them she had already often made the reflection as the first step in an existence more intelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chain of causes and consequences was definitely traceable so many things and at the head of the list her fathers marriage having appeared to her to flow from charlottes visit to fawns and that event itself having flowed from the memorable talk but what perhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations was that it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because they had thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if their family coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking its complement of wheels having but three as they might say it had wanted another and what had charlotte done from the first but begin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest than the greater grace of the movement of the vehicle as to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely to feel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far as she was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place since the work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasnt too much to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had a long pause before the fire during which she might have been fixing with intensity her projected vision have been conscious even of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might have been watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her father were not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to see and be seen like an infant positively royal so that the exertion was all with the others maggie found in this image a repeated challenge again and yet again she paused before the fire after which each time in the manner of one for whom a strong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to livelier movement she had seen herself at last in the picture she was studying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly with the wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heart stood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting as if this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to see what would follow the person had taken a decision which was evidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt a sharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do she looked about her from the middle of the room under the force of this question as if there exactly were the field of action involved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a first opportunity her husband had reappeared he stood before her refreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her over the end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had depended on his look and now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed more quickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding out his arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she had somehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warm high tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment of confidence from her knowing as she believed what to do all the next day and all the next she appeared to herself to know it she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consisted of the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as a question what if ive abandoned them you know what if ive accepted too passively the funny form of our life there would be a process of her own by which she might do differently in respect to amerigo and charlotte a process quite independent of any process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before her to affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageous simplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have been struck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by the success that had already begun to attend her she had only had herself to do something to see how immediately it answered this consciousness of its having answered with her husband was the uplifting sustaining wave he had met her she so put it to herself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety in especial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which she wore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both from something not quite definite but clearly much less good even at that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she had been when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it out of the heart of her earnestness plucking it in the garden of thought as if it had been some fullblown flower that she could present to him on the spot well it was the flower of participation and as that then and there she held it out to him putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever the enjoyment the interest the experience might be and sharing also for that matter with charlotte she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of the recent adventure of the companions letting him see without reserve that she wished to hear everything about it and making charlotte in particular charlottes judgment of matcham charlottes aspect her success there her effect traceably produced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefully displayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggies inquiry was most empathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of the cathedralhunt which she was so glad they had entertained and as to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef and breadandcheese the queer old smell and the dirty tablecloth at the inn amerigo was goodhumouredly responsive he had looked at her across the table more than once as if touched by the humility of this welcome offered to impressions at secondhand the amusements the large freedoms only of others as if recognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he had renewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such as it was on which she had ventured they had risen together to come upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of the people at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matter of the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round the table to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares one of the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time not invisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense of this charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for a moment be going to say you neednt pretend dearest quite so hard neednt think it necessary to care quite so much it was as if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer would have been all ready that she wasnt in the least pretending and she looked up at him while he took her hand with the maintenance the real persistence of her lucid little plan in her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very moment that she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadnt been since the funny changes that was really all one could call them into which they had each as for the sake of the others too easily and too obligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted that their life together required as people in london said a special form which was very well so long as the form was kept only for the outside world and was made no more of among themselves than the pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didnt hesitate to break with the spoon so much as that she would with an opening have allowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him to understand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if he had but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point of making the acknowledgment of his catching at her brave little idea for their case she would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence what befell however was that even while she thus waited she felt herself present at a process taking place rather deeper within him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with an idea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddly enough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped to these perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than he had yet done which really brought it to the turn of a hair for her that she didnt make sure his notion of her idea was the right one it was the turn of a hair because he had possession of her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if to see to understand more or possibly give more she didnt know which and that had the effect of simply putting her as she would have said in his power she gave up let her idea go let everything go her one consciousness was that he was taking her again into his arms it was not till afterwards that she discriminated as to this felt how the act operated with him instead of the words he hadnt uttered operated in his view as probably better than any words as always better in fact at any time than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtual assent to the assumption he had thus made that there was really nothing such a demonstration didnt anticipate and didnt dispose of and that the spring acting within herself moreover might well have been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provoke it it made for any issue the third time since his return that he had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her to his side as they left the room he kept her close for their moving into the hall and across it kept her for their slow return together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness and the degree of her sensibility but even while she felt these things sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror of the weakness they produced in her it was still for her that she had positively something to do and that she mustnt be weak for this must much rather be strong for many hours after none the less she remained weak if weak it was though holding fast indeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overture had been after all so unmistakably met she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this left her charlotte always to deal with charlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such other ranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took the measure in approaching her on the morrow of her return from matcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story she wanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from her companion and promptly in eaton square whither without the prince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to the subject both in her husbands presence and during several scraps of independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggie took the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be not less than her own allowing that is for everything his wife would already have had to tell him for such passages between them as might have occurred since the evening before joining them after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed with the application of her idea before they had quitted the breakfastroom the scene of their midday meal she referred in her parents presence to what she might have lost by delay and expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two left for her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and her husband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he had left the table but was seated near the fire with two or three of the morning papers and the residuum of the second and third posts on a stand beside him more even than the usual extravagance as maggies glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes and foreign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreign clothes charlotte at the window looking into the sidestreet that abutted on the square might have been watching for their visitors advent before withdrawing and in the light strange and coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed the impression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fully shown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knew herself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution for which she must intensely work that consciousness lately born in her had been taught the evening before to accept a temporary lapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of her own house and her walking across half the town for she had come from portland place on foot found breath still in its lungs it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities looming through the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to the golden mist had considerably melted away but there they were again definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as if she could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp to her above all was the renewed attestation of her fathers comprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as of the same quality with her own but which so distinctly now she should have the complication of being obliged to deal with separately they had not yet struck her as absolutely extraordinary which had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really no new judgment of them she should be able to show without attracting in some degree his attention without perhaps exciting his surprise and making thereby for the situation she shared with him some difference she was reminded and warned by the concrete image and for a minute charlottes face immediately presented to her affected her as searching her own to see the reminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid her cheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easy change of guard charlottes own frequent though always cheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggie figured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use and custom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the password have departed without irrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman had been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm at a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at any risk the note she had been privately practising if she had practised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew but the better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immensely helped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of the prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her curiosity frankly and gaily she had come to ask to ask what in their unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she had got out of her husband she admitted what she could but husbands were never the persons who answered such questions ideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrived early this way in order to miss as little as possible of charlottes story wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are not much better than husbands he never she smiled tells me more than a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you havent told him everything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost the best part of it maggie went she went she felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a part and rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before the footlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in the text it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that kept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense of action that logically involved some platform action quite positively for the first time in her life or counting in the previous afternoon for the second the platform remained for three or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had all the while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quite heroically improvising preparation and practice had come but a short way her part opened out and she invented from moment to moment what to say and to do she had but one rule of art to keep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might see for a week how far that would take her she said to herself in her excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about a difference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if they should suspect they would want a reason and the humiliating truth was that she wasnt ready with a reason not that is with what she would have called a reasonable one she thought of herself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all her life at her fathers side and by his example only in reasonable reasons and what she would really have been most ashamed of would be to produce for him in this line some inferior substitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition would be a necessary implication of the former without the former behind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she could play but there was only one and to play it would be to end the game she felt herself as at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arranged counters her fathers playmate and partner and what it constantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask a question to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the play of the others would be to break the charm the charm she had to call it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to say anything at all would be in fine to have to say why she was jealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility by the end of a week the week that had begun especially with her morning hour in eaton square between her father and his wife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had become again verily greater than her consciousness of anything else and i must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddly wondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite so overwhelming charlottes response to the experiment of being more with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped the experiment with the feeling of success so that if the success itself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image of it it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young womans aftertaste of amerigos own determined demonstrations maggie was to have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste and if i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as she had so insidiously taken the field a definite note must be made of her perception during those moments of charlottes prompt uncertainty she had shown no doubt she couldnt not have shown that she had arrived with an idea quite exactly as she had shown her husband the night before that she was awaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situations was to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expression in the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed to herself was that she had affected them or at any rate the sensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to it often to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of its interest to play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containing on either side a cherished little portrait and suspended round her neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort would ever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw them forever face to face and when she looked from one to the other she found in charlottes eyes the gleam of the momentary what does she really want that had come and gone for her in the princes so again she saw the other light the light touched into a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soon as she had betrayed that she wanted no harm wanted no greater harm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to go out with her she had been present at that process as personally as she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of the principino with his first little trousers she remained present accordingly all the week so charmingly and systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceable passage in the breakfastroom she had seen her take it had been taken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications or reserves however bland it had been taken with avidity with gratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplanted explanations the very liberality of this accommodation might indeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of the matter as if it had fairly written the princess down as a person of variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tact in accepting these caprices for law the caprice actually prevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladies anywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected of her only held herself there for instructions in order even to better them if possible the two young women while the passage lasted became again very much the companions of other days the days of charlottes prolonged visits to the admiring and bountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for them had been all the result of the latters native vagueness about her own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanying expression appreciation endearment confidence the rarer charm produced in each by this active contribution to the felicity of the other all enhanced furthermore enhanced or qualified who should say which by a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlottes part in particular of intensity of observance in the matter of appeal and response in the matter of making sure the princess might be disposed or gratified that resembled an attempt to play again with more refinement at disparity of relation charlottes attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses of civility selfeffacements in the presence of others sudden little formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might have represented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of a social distinction this impression came out most for maggie when in their easier intervals they had only themselves to regard and when her companions inveteracy of never passing first of not sitting till she was seated of not interrupting till she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was also sensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse a kind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like a canopy of state a reminder that though the ladyinwaiting was an established favourite safe in her position a little queen however goodnatured was always a little queen and might with small warning remember it and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success all the while was the perception that in another quarter too things were being made easy charlottes alacrity in meeting her had in one sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it had begun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husbands showing her that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise only required as one of the other phrases was too the straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods of amusement at english slang in his remarkable displays of assimilative power power worthy of better causes and higher inspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a way that certainly in the first glow of relief had made her brief interval seem large then however immediately and even though superficially there had declared itself a readjustment of relations to which she was once more practically a little sacrificed i must do everything she had said without letting papa see what i do at least till its done but she scarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days to blind or beguile this participant in her life what had in fact promptly enough happened she presently recognised was that if her stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and if she had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from her husbands side so on the other hand this had with as little delay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eaton square when she went home with charlotte from whatever happy demonstration for the benefit of the world in which they supposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reason why their closer association shouldnt be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come either to sit with his fatherinlaw in the absence of the ladies or to make on his side precisely some such display of the easy working of the family life as would represent the equivalent of her excursions with charlotte under this particular impression it was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition to challenge the perfection of their common state it divided them again that was true this particular turn of the tide cut them up afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for the equilibrium was what between them all had most power of insistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while at bottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as against that he was making her father not miss her and he could have rendered neither of them a more excellent service he was acting in short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had been enough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour his instinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable prompted him immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehow into its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to have married a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spite of her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into the grossness of discussion she yet found again and again in portland place moments for saying if i didnt love you you know for yourself i should still love you for him he looked at her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eaton square when she called her attention to his benevolence through the dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of her extravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency to reckon with but my poor child charlotte might under this pressure have been on the point of replying thats the way nice people are all round so that why should one be surprised about it were all nice together as why shouldnt we be if we hadnt been we wouldnt have gone far and i consider that weve gone very far indeed why should you take on as if you werent a perfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest things as if you hadnt in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere of all the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as i came near you and that youve allowed me now between you to make so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have but just failed to make another point a point charmingly natural to her as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isnt a bit wonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go about with mine i happen love to appreciate my husband i happen perfectly to understand that his acquaintance should be cultivated and his company enjoyed some such happilyprovoked remarks as these from charlotte at the other house had been in the air but we have seen how there was also in the air for our young woman as an emanation from the same source a distilled difference of which the very principle was to keep down objections and retorts that impression came back it had its hours of doing so and it may interest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie a final reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a light flashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon as this light had spread a little it produced in some quarters a surprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself why there should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strange shore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with a start she found herself quaking at the thought that the boat might have put off again and left her the word for it the word that flashed the light was that they were treating her that they were proceeding with her and for that matter with her father by a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own it was not from her that they took their cue but and this was what in particular made her sit up from each other and with a depth of unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when once her attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out at her in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms her own consciousness of it might take a view determined by the change of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise in her on their return from matcham they had had to read into this small and allbutsuppressed variation a mute comment on they didnt quite know what and it now arched over the princesss head like a vault of bold span that important communication between them on the subject couldnt have failed of being immediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and out of it as well the question for instance of why such promptitude of harmony should have been important ah when she began to recover piece by piece the process became lively she might have been picking small shining diamonds out of the sweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit over her dustbin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of her innocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision of amerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottino while her eyes from her placed chair took him in then it was that this immense little memory gave out its full power since the question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shut it out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shut in there with her sentient self only the fact of his reappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things had been testimony after all to supersede any other for on the spot even while she looked the warmlywashing wave had travelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived for hours she couldnt count under the dizzying smothering welter positively in submarine depths where everything came to her through walls of emerald and motherofpearl though indeed she had got her head above them for breath when face to face with charlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile none the less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression had remained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side of the barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of the lightest pretext to reenter it was as if he had found this pretext in her observed necessity of comparing comparing the obvious common elements in her husbands and her stepmothers ways of now taking her with or without her witness at any rate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity of earnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight of these approximations that she had made out the promise of her dawn it was a workedout scheme for their not wounding her for their behaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winning way induced the other to contribute and which therefore so far as that went proved that she had become with them a subject of intimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their clever idea the idea by which for all these days her own idea had been profiting they had built her in with their purpose which was why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so that she sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in a bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim of which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless one were a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by ones request it wasnt in the least what she had requested she had flapped her little wings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for a more gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar above all she hadnt complained not by the quaver of a syllable so what wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she received as to which she had exchanged the least word with them if she had ever whined or moped they might have had some reason but she would be hanged she conversed with herself in strong language if she had been from beginning to end anything but pliable and mild it all came back in consequence to some required process of their own a process operating quite positively as a precaution and a policy they had got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each other must keep her there in that condition she wouldnt interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a great intensity had indeed its pauses and timidities but always to take afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground was wellnigh covered by the time she had made out her husband and his colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom of movement policy or no policy it was they themselves who were arranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrange them it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon as she could give them a motive for strangely as it had by this time begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imagined them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her own of course they were arranged all four arranged but what had the basis of their life been precisely but that they were arranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but she to confine the matter only to herself was arranged apart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quite another rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguelyclutching hand with which during the first shock of complete perception she tried to steady herself she felt very much alone xxvii there had been from far back that is from the christmas time on a plan that the parent and the child should do something lovely together and they had recurred to it on occasion nursed it and brought it up theoretically though without as yet quite allowing it to put its feet to the ground the most it had done was to try a few steps on the drawingroom carpet with much attendance on either side much holding up and guarding much anticipation in fine of awkwardness or accident their companions by the same token had constantly assisted at the performance following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety and never so full of applause maggie now made out for herself as when the infant project had kicked its little legs most wildly kicked them for all the world across the channel and half the continent kicked them over the pyrenees and innocently crowed out some rich spanish name she asked herself at present if it had been a real belief that they were but wanting for some such adventure to snatch their moment whether either had at any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy to dangle before the other that they should take flight without wife or husband for one more look before they died at the madrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay in respect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on and profusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiseless arrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise been given away the vision dallied with during the duskier days in eaton square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks of springtime for the total adventure three or four weeks in the very spirit after all of their regular life as their regular life had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looksin at old places on vague chances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which had essentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt as costing as costing the parent and child nothing it was for maggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about their going to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their plan even if nothing had happened her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give us the measure of her sense that everything had happened a difference had been made in her relation to each of her companions and what it compelled her to say to herself was that to behave as she might have behaved before would be to act for amerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw in these days that a journey abroad with her father would more than anything else have amounted on his part and her own to a last expression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of the idea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day she put off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and very comprehensively called it speaking that is to her father and all the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to his himself breaking silence she gave him time gave him during several days that morning that noon that night and the next and the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stood off longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasnt at peace they would then have been all successfully throwing dust in each others eyes and it would be at last as if they must turn away their faces since the silver mist that protected them had begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period of twentyfour hours she must take it as showing that they were in her private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity could there be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at the approach of a summer that already promised to be hot such a proposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would be his way of being consistent for that he didnt really want to move or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasnt at heart contented what he wanted at any rate and what he didnt want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a fresh wind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square on the occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver to lord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration of this sort had been for many days before our group the question reduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should first take the field the issue had been easily settled in the manner of every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone to matcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eaton square might have passed for a demonstration all the more personal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess of matcham made up the company and each of these persons had for maggie the interest of an attested connection with the easter revels at that visionary house their common memory of an occasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others than in amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutable comradeship against which the young womans imagination broke in a small vain wave it wasnt that she wished she had been of the remembered party and possessed herself of its secrets for she didnt care about its secrets she could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that she became aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishment required by her own and of the amount of it she might somehow extract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to the desire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving of fairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quite enjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element of curiosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious of the flitting wing of this last impression the perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hers there was no limit to her conceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again tonight after her start was taken went positively as she had felt herself going three weeks before on the morning when the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her together in the breakfastroom had been so determinant in this other scene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled the light or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didnt like in spite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on the yellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsest eyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightest manner on the wrongest assumption her ladyships assumption was that she kept at every moment of her life every advantage it made her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didnt distinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller social insects often endowed with such a range from the other decorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked in london and in the world at large so many more people than she had thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise in this case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that a charming clever woman wondered about her that is wondered about her as amerigos wife and wondered moreover with the intention of kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise the point of view that one was what she read in their free contemplation in that of the whole eight there was something in amerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderly and expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner by its firmlystuffed middle for the account she could give she might have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach she might have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation of nature oh yes im here all the while im also in my way a solid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husband for an amount of pains toward my training that money would scarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner before they dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almost violently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didnt mind the same party which was the party she wanted oh she was going she was going she could feel it afresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or had suddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in the connection as there would be hitches in the process she didnt wholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at least begun something she so fairly liked to feel that she was a point for convergence of wonder it wasnt after all either that their wonder so much signified that of the cornered six whom it glimmered before her that she might still live to drive about like a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness its sharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo and charlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much as once look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped for the succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post theyre paralysed theyre paralysed she commented deep within so much it helped her own apprehension to hang together that they should suddenly lose their bearings her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her view of causes but it came to her then and there that if she could only get the facts of appearance straight only jam them down into their place the reasons lurking behind them kept uncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldnt perhaps be able to help showing it wasnt of course that the prince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to their friends it was rather precisely that civil was just what she wasnt she had so departed from any such custom of delicate approach approach by the permitted note the suggested if the accepted vagueness as would enable the people in question to put her off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect of the violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly in their being the people in question people she had seemed to be rather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouth so wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered by her agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter what people they were or werent but meanwhile the particular sense of them that she had taken home tonight had done her the service of seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same for her father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone he did exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing of and did it as he did everything with a simplicity that left any purpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further of going in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothing whatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely and beautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they should lose by breaking the charm i guess we wont go down there after all will we mag just when its getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done for her at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo and charlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as she almost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything now so fitted for her to everything else that she could feel the effect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of giving the pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutes during which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either side of her larger than they had ever loomed before larger than life larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous for her during which she took no more account of them than if they were not in the room she had never never treated them in any such way not even just now when she had plied her art upon the matcham band her present manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was charged with their silence while she talked with her other companion as if she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the note amazingly by his allusion to the pleasantness that of such an occasion as his successful dinner which might figure as their bribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speaking selfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions of experience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedented energy threw herself into her fathers presence as by the absolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying to herself at the same time that she smiled and talked and inaugurated her system what does he mean by it thats the question what does he mean but studying again all the signs in him that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting the stricken minutes on the part of the others it was in their silence that the others loomed as she felt she had had no measure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew out and out really to what would have been called in simpler conditions awkwardness as if she herself were stretching the cord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage to which her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at the first announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch it almost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger much less before his move to the door than they usually lingered at the gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the odd effect of his not having and of charlottes not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or more exactly settled before them he had had time to become aware of this possible impression in her and his virtually urging her into the carriage was connected with his feeling that he must take action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her would absolutely have tormented him but he had already found something to soothe and correct as to which she had on her side a shrewd notion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in the brougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce an interval she brought it straight out i was certain that was what father would say if i should leave him alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to move he likes too much to be with us but if you see the effect she felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you dont see the cause the cause my dear is too lovely her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minute or two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by his single arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intending and desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than she felt anything else that whatever he might do she mustnt be irresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knew what that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of her conceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become the sharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speech after a fashion the cause of your fathers deciding not to go yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietly i mean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immensely resisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogether new the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantage that absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressibly strange so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever and what her husbands grasp really meant as her very bones registered was that she should give it up it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to it he could be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely a part of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm for intercourse for expression for life she should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didnt resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted her every throb that is but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keep it though she was also staring out of the carriagewindow with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was making an effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldnt cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same through the square opening beside her through the grey panorama of the london night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay its not to leave you my dear for that hell give up anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggie pursued with her gaze out of her window for which amerigos answer again took him a moment ah the dear old boy you would like me to propose him something well if you think you could bear it and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spoke it came clear why shouldnt charlotte be just one of my reasons my not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to me but never so wonderfully as just now we have somehow been more together thinking for the time almost only of each other it has been quite as in old days and she proceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate its as if we had been missing each other had got a little apart though going on so side by side but the good moments if one only waits for them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover youve seen for yourself since youve made it up so to father feeling for yourself in your beautiful way every difference every air that blows not having to be told or pushed only being perfect to live with through your habit of kindness and your exquisite instincts but of course youve seen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt how youve managed managed that he hasnt been too much alone and that i on my side havent appeared to what you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can never bless you enough for of all the good things youve done for me youve never done anything better she went on explaining as for the pleasure of explaining even though knowing he must recognise as a part of his easy way too her description of his large liberality your taking the child down yourself those days and your coming each time to bring him away nothing in the world nothing you could have invented would have kept father more under the charm besides you know how youve always suited him and how youve always so beautifully let it seem to him that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as if you wished just in order to please him to remind him of it afresh so there it is she wound up its your doing youve produced your effect that of his wanting not to be even for a month or two where youre not he doesnt want to bother or bore you that i think you know he never has done and if youll only give me time ill come round again to making it my care as always that he shant but he cant bear you out of his sight she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in and all really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primed to the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hung it before him remembering happily how he had gone so far one day supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eaton square to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasant inspiration both his elder and his younger companion with the latter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducing granddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lions and tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus dropped into her husbands silence the truth about his good nature and his good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself of her failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but of the most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve the mere movement of a muscle but the act grew important between them just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talk in the very tone that would naturally have swept her into tenderness she knew more and more every lapsing minute taught her how he might by a single rightness make her cease to watch him that rightness a million miles removed from the queer actual falling so short which would consist of his breaking out to her diviningly indulgently with the last happy inconsequence come away with me somewhere you and then we neednt think we neednt even talk of anything of anyone else five words like that would answer her would break her utterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by the testimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in his heart and on his lips only they didnt sound and as that made her wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turn showed her that he too watched and waited and how much he had expected something that he now felt wouldnt come yes it wouldnt come if he didnt answer her if he but said the wrong things instead of the right if he could say the right everything would come it hung by a hair that everything might crystallise for their recovered happiness at his touch this possibility glowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turn cold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of reality and knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breath upon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyond that of her natural being they had silences at last that were almost crudities of mutual resistance silences that persisted through his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part he had lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her so talking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was no such manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love if this had been in question better than that on top of which it came to her presently to say keeping in with what she had already spoken except of course that for the question of going off somewhere hed go readily quite delightedly with you i verily believe hed like to have you for a while to himself do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after a moment sounded oh no he doesnt ask as you must so often have seen but i believe hed go like a shot as you say if you were to suggest it it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and she had asked herself while she spoke if it wouldnt cause his arm to let her go the fact that it didnt suggested to her that she had made him of a sudden still more intensely think think with such concentration that he could do but one thing at once and it was precisely as if the concentration had the next moment been proved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficial impression a jump that made light of their approach to gravity and represented for her the need in him to gain time that she made out was his drawback that the warning from her had come to him and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly that they were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they must enjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didnt like and it was as if she were watching his effort without disguise whats your fathers idea this year then about fawns will he go at whitsuntide and will he then stay on maggie went through the form of thought he will really do i imagine as he has in so many ways so often done before do whatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and theres of course always charlotte to be considered only their going early to fawns if they do go she said neednt in the least entail your and my going ah amerigo echoed it neednt in the least entail your and my going we can do as we like what they may do neednt trouble us since theyre by good fortune perfectly happy together oh the prince returned your fathers never so happy as with you near him to enjoy his being so well i may enjoy it said maggie but im not the cause of it youre the cause her husband declared of the greater part of everything thats good among us but she received this tribute in silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver has arrears of time with you to make up as you say shell scarcely do it or you scarcely will by our cutting your and my cutting too loose i see what you mean maggie mused he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him a journey maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldnt by choosing such a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seem not to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off i should respond on the contrary very markedly by being here alone with her for a month and would you like to be here alone with her for a month i could do with it beautifully or we might even she said quite gaily go together down to fawns you could be so very content without me the prince presently inquired yes my own dear if you could be content for a while with father that would keep me up i might for the time she went on go to stay there with charlotte or better still she might come to portland place oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness i should feel you see she continued that the two of us were showing the same sort of kindness amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i maggie again hesitated you and i darling i see i see he promptly took it in and what reason shall i give give i mean your father for asking him to go off why the very simplest if you conscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeable to him just that only something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldnt i conscientiously it wouldnt by your own contention he developed represent any surprise for him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him ah there it was again for maggie the note already sounded the note of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionary view she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillness together so perfect what had suggested so around them the attitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before she was well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity of thought amerigos last words youre the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken and heard it the more that for a minute after she felt her husbands eyes on her face very close too close for her to see him he was looking at her because he was struck and looking hard though his answer when it came was straight enough why isnt that just what we have been talking about that ive affected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure he might show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing to me an excursion and you would go with him maggie immediately asked he hung fire but an instant per dio she also had her pause but she broke it since gaiety was in the air with an intense smile you can say that safely because the proposals one that of his own motion he wont make she couldnt have narrated afterwards and in fact was at a loss to tell herself by what transition what rather marked abruptness of change in their personal relation their drive came to its end with a kind of interval established almost confessed to between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all in such a case too long hes a person to think you might easily feel yourself to be so it wont maggie said come from father hes too modest their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of the brougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiled for it so that unless i insist we shall simply go on as we are well were going on beautifully he answered though by no means with the effect it would have had if their mute transaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape had not taken place as maggie said nothing none the less to gainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the next moment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in to break in between your father and his wife but there would be a way he said we can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herself now wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggest to him that he shall let me take him off oh said maggie then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out shell be able to tell him the reason they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rung at the housedoor that you think it would be so charming that i think it would be so charming that weve persuaded her will be convincing i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let them out i see she said again though she felt a little disconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that her stepmother might report her as above all concerned for the proposal and this brought her back her need that her father shouldnt think her concerned in any degree for anything she alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat her husband to let her out had passed before her and a little in advance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a step high that preceded their open entrance on either side of which one of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendously ordered and fixed rose before her and there was something in amerigos very face while his eyes again met her own through the dusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it he had answered her just before distinctly and it appeared to leave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned for the last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost as if in the strangest way in the world he were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness for the way she had slipped from him during their drive xxviii maggies new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch as she not only was conscious during several days that followed of no fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck in quite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of that difference she had taken it into her head to work for she recognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a manner caught up her father had been not less so with the effect of her husbands and his wifes closing in together round them and of their all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead a life gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far as the easy sound of it went as never before it might have been an accident and a mere coincidence so at least she said to herself at first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearance had risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainly pleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for its always turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very much the same thing at the same time and in the same way funny all this was to some extent in the light of the fact that the father and daughter for so long had expressed so few positive desires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo and charlotte had at last got a little tired of each others company they should find their relief not so much in sinking to the rather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull the latter into the train in which they so constantly moved were in the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eaton square with lady castledean weve suddenly waked up in it and found ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put in during sleep shoved like a pair of labelled boxes into the van and since i wanted to go im certainly going she might have added im moving without trouble theyre doing it all for us its wonderful how they understand and how perfectly it succeeds for that was the thing she had most immediately to acknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as it had formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair of couples this latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared at all qualified was represented as might have been said by her irresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the train indulged in one of its occasional lurches then there was no denying it his eyes and her own met so that they were themselves doing active violence as against the others to that very spirit of union or at least to that very achievement of change which she had taken the field to invoke the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matcham party dined in portland place the day really perhaps of maggies maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing for her own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantly rallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her its heroine it was as if her father himself always with more initiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in the conspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presence of the assinghams likewise very much caughtup now after something of a lull by the sidewind of all the rest of the motion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny was concerned the sense of some special intention of encouragement and applause fanny who had not been present at the other dinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed by charlotte made a splendid show at this one in new orangecoloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with a confidence furthermore as different as possible her hostess inferred from her toomarked betrayal of a belittled state at matcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity to redress this balance which seemed for the hour part of a general rectification she liked making out for herself that on the high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts of grounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear to take the lead in recognition and celebration so far as the evening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the little princess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of giving her constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly by her help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that the little princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised she couldnt definitely have said how it happened but she felt herself for the first time in her career living up to the public and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed upon her from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she did so at that strange mixture in things through which the popular notion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great ones of the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assingham might really have been there at all events like one of the assistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of the sleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangled skirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined to be the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her with such alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even as seemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking and such an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herself as perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a fresh contingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses for whom the princely art was a matter of course that was what she was learning to do to fill out as a matter of course her appointed her expected her imposed character and though there were latent considerations that somewhat interfered with the lesson she was having tonight an inordinate quantity of practice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly she directed it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last to an unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this high result caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quite feverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in some marvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succour to herself become beautifully divinely retributive the intensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in fact that somehow by a process and through a connexion not again to be traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo and charlotte with only the drawback her constant check and secondthought that she concomitantly practised perhaps still more on her father this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilement those at which her sense for precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt her communion with him more intimate than any other it couldnt but pass between them that something singular was happening so much as this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfort of it was there after all to be noted just as much as the possible peril and she could think of the couple they formed together as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks that had never been so tender for some freedom some fiction some figured bravery under which they might safely talk of it the moment was to come and it finally came with an effect as penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric button when she read the least helpful of meanings into the agitation she had created the merely specious description of their case would have been that after being for a long time as a family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still had a new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly her fathers appetite and her own in particular had been kept fresh and grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a whole was the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutching instinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything is remarkably pleasant isnt it but where for it after all are we up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in the depths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a goldmine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite of rearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of the different weights but the balance persisted and triumphed all of which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to face with the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test if they balanced they balanced she had to take that it deprived her of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to him by the rigour of their law and when it came over her that all the while the wish on his side to spare her might be what most worked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of sweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in her yearning for her husband she was powerless however was only more utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when she would have been all ready to say to him yes this is by every appearance the best time weve had yet but dont you see all the same how they must be working together for it and how my very success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a new basis comes round to being their success above all their cleverness their amiability their power to hold out their complete possession in short of our life for how could she say as much as that without saying a great deal more without saying theyll do everything in the world that suits us save only one thing prescribe a line for us that will make them separate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintly murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that would have made her quail separate my dear do you want them to separate then you want us to you and me for how can the one separation take place without the other that was the question that in spirit she had heard him ask with its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their own separation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable but only on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford as it were he to let his wife she to let her husband run them in such compact formation and say they accepted this account of their situation as a practical finality acting upon it and proceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smothered past on either side show across the widening strait pale unappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasion to say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery in recoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as she had felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband during their return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square the evening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then a lull had come the alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill what she had feared and why it had taken this hour a month to arrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to a particular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmony and prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this resource the more it came back to her as the product of a conscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at the moment of many things conscious even not a little of desiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in a given case the given case would be that of her being to a certain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmother intervene as they might call it in a question that seemed just then and there quite peculiarly their own business why it was that a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strike her as charged with the spirit of a threat was an oddity disconnected for her temporarily from its grounds the adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its way that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with an excessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been no prompt sequel to the princes equivocal light and that made for patience yet she was none the less to have to admit after delay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presence of his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with her what didnt what mightnt that mean when she had so absolutely never at any point of contact with him put him by as much as the value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use of charlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree and his triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldnt and he knew it say what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever so differently and separately not at all in the same way or degree theres nobody we really use together but ourselves dont you see by which i mean that where our interests are the same i can so beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and you can so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only person either of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter of course in such a case as this drag in charlotte she couldnt so challenge him because it would have been and there she was paralysed the note it would have translated itself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and from reverberation to repercussion would have reached her fathers exactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peaceful sleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her to catch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerly been easy there had been in fact of old the time so strangely seemed already far away an inevitability in her longer passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in the calculability round about them of everything but at present charlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her to eaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her and amerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought her husband to portland place where charlotte was constantly bringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes that put them face to face had as yet of late contrived to count but little between them either for the sense of opportunity or for that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of their intercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarterofanhour to gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through large still spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive it appeared indeed to have become true that their common appeal measured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talked with their companions but these latter assuredly were not in any directer way to gain light on the current phase of their relation such were some of the reasons for which maggie suspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by a new movement to the surface suspected it one morning late in may when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretext of that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of a feverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend the interval at home this was ground ample ground for punctual inquiry but what it wasnt ground for she quickly found herself reflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedly as their life had recently come to be arranged with his wifes attendance it had so happened that she herself was for the hour exempt from her husbands and it will at once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when i note that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he was going out the princess whimsically wondered if their respective sposi mightnt frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed they were temporarily so disposed of strange was her need at moments to think of them as not attaching an excessive importance to their repudiation of the general practice that had rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the air they had none of them come to that for wasnt she at this minute testifying directly against them by her own behaviour when she should confess to fear of being alone with her father to fear of what he might then ah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horror of say to her then would be time enough for amerigo and charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading a particular question from him and of being able to check yes even to disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receiving it any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made them talk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invited maggie aware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetness of its invitation to one couple just as much as to another her humbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it and there was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she was humbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her life doing it up to the full height of what she had allowed for the necessity in the great dimlyshining room where declining for his reasons to sit down he moved about in amerigos very footsteps the necessity affected her as pressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of the old pleasantness between them so candidly playing up there again of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surface all for familiar use quite as if generalised from the long succession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which his theory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses beside her own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as well as anything would ever teach her that she must never intermit for a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove that there was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remote matters struck herself for instance as acting all in its interest when she proposed their going out in the exercise of their freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in the regents park this resort was close at hand at the top of portland place and the principino beautifully better had already proceeded there under high attendance all of which considerations were defensive for maggie all of which became to her mind part of the business of cultivating continuity upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of the empty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of her abrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imagination almost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular difference his marriage had made the particular difference seemed at such instants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were together concerned of any one of anything but each other it hadnt been her marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presence no not even with her husbands she groaned to herself while the vain imagination lasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came up to her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautiful than the way in which till charlotte came so much more closely into their life amerigo hadnt interfered what she had gone on owing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a column of figures or call it even if one would a house of cards it was her fathers wonderful act that had tipped the house down and made the sum wrong with all of which immediately after her question her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of his reason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he did it exactly that our freedom meaning beloved man simply and solely mine should be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring what became of him she found time upstairs even in her haste as she had repeatedly found time before to let the wonderments involved in these recognitions flash at her with their customary effect of making her blink the question in especial of whether she might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit of what he had done in forcing her care really to grow as much less as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weight of their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it all came from her not having been able not to mind not to mind what became of him not having been able without anxiety to let him go his way and take his risk and lead his life she had made anxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while she stuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hat she had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whom she had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that she didnt want her she tried to focus the possibility of some understanding between them in consequence of which he should cut loose very near indeed it looked any such possibility that consciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into the conditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance between the aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberless other moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quick in her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide that sometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was still left for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs before she came down to him in the span of which she asked herself if it werent thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didnt go into the detail of what sacrificing him would mean she didnt need to so distinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he was awaiting her that she should find him walking up and down the drawingroom in the warm fragrant air to which the open windows and the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely moving there and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a little freely as like her parent with the appearance about him above all of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love do sacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should she insist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her all conscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of the intensity of this figure however was to make her shake it away in her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after she had picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thought that her impossibility was made absolutely by his consciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she felt while she smiled there for him again all hypocritically while she drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the process first to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to make up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose into his cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have to redouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so without his dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arranged his cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held his arm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by much the same intimate pressure she had always used when a little girl to mark the inseparability of her doll she did all these things so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what they might be for xxix there was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fell short till they got well into the park and he struck her as giving unexpectedly the goby to any serious search for the principino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign of that his dropping with her into the first pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a little after they were placed as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharply how the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbidden her how the use of it would be for all the world like undoing the leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truth for she was believing herself in relation to the truth at which she mustnt so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionate prudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptoms and betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having to make it evident while she recognised them that she didnt wince there were moments between them in their chairs when he might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of something new that would trip her up there were pauses during which with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine she might yet as at some hard game over a table for money have been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication of consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of the great style in which she had kept this up later on at the hours end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigo and charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say to herself that truly she had put her plan through even though once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation every minute of the time not fall below the standard of that other hour in the treasured past which hung there behind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermark for the history of their old fortune the summer evening in the park at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its most golden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her at present in the very question of their taking up anew that residence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it in spite of the impression from him of his holding off to see what she would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keepingup and stretchingout indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country as weve established and accepted them would stand for she had positively lost herself in this inward doubt so much she was subsequently to remember but remembering then too that her companion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager had broken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton square after the banquet to the castledeans her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the vision of what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still more eminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasnt her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it just as she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldnt well help thrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of her private excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitate oh as never yet the ancient tone of gold it had verily come from him at last the question of whether she thought it would be very good but very good indeed that he should leave england for a series of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it had been that she was to know her husbands menace hadnt really dropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk had stayed out with them and come home with them besides making it impossible that they shouldnt presently feign to recollect how rejoining the child had been their original purpose maggies uneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused them afterwards to rejoice as well that the boys irrepressibly importunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with the extension imparted by his governess a person expectant of consideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for that was what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to her to try her quite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and his wife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me that maggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested my speaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make you consent so i do speak see being always so eager myself as you know to meet maggies wishes i speak but without quite understanding this time what she has in her head why should she of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship you off together and to remain here alone with me the compliments all to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like the prince is quite ready evidently to do his part but youll have it out with him that is youll have it out with her something of that kind was what in her minds ear maggie heard and this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was her fathers invitation to her to have it out well as she could say to herself all the rest of the day that was what they did while they continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was what they had done as much as they would now ever ever have out anything the measure of this at least had been given that each would fight to the last for the protection for the perversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting his eyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancy that they might both he and his soninlaw have welcomed such an escapade since they had both been so long so furiously domestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration of this opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arminarm might encounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for the time at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with her eyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companions horribly vulgar yet without minding it either such luck should she have if to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and i thought amerigo might like it better she had said than wandering off alone do you mean that he wont go unless i take him she had considered here and never in her life had she considered so promptly and so intently if she really put it that way her husband challenged might belie the statement so that what would that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps ask straight out why she was exerting pressure she couldnt of course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting pressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldnt that be just what you must have out with him decidedly if he makes me the proposal but he hasnt made it yet oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps hes too shy because youre so sure he so really wants my company i think he has thought you might like it well i should but with this he looked away from her and she held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him to address the question to amerigo straight or inquire if she should be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he had done neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood off from the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason to attenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if to fill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by his abstention he had himself presently given her a reason had positively spared her the effort of asking whether he judged charlotte not to have approved he had taken everything on himself that was what had settled her she had had to wait very little more to feel with this how much he was taking the point he made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space on any such scale between himself and his wife he wasnt so unhappy with her far from it and maggie was to hold that he had grinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of this as to be able to hint that he required the relief of absence therefore unless it was for the prince himself oh i dont think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together well then there we are i see and she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectly rub on together and then he had appeared for a little to be making time to put it only so he had mildly and happily added to put it only so he had spoken as if he might easily put it much better yet as if the humour of contented understatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had played then either all consciously or all unconsciously into charlottes hands and the effect of this was to render trebly oppressive maggies conviction of charlottes plan she had done what she wanted his wife had which was also what amerigo had made her do she had kept her test maggies test from becoming possible and had applied instead a test of her own it was exactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraid to be summoned to say under the least approach to crossexamination why any change was desirable and it was for our young woman herself still more prodigiously as if her father had been capable of calculations to match of judging it important he shouldnt be brought to demand of her what was the matter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadnt he demanded it always from calculation that was why that was why he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when a minute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch or two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the anomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to the question there seems a kind of charm doesnt there on our life and quite as if just lately it had got itself somehow renewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfish prosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixed everything down to the last lovely object for the last glass case of the last corner left over of my old show thats the only takeoff that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bit languid lying like gods together all careless of mankind do you consider that were languid that form of rejoinder she had jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do you consider that we are careless of mankind living as we do in the biggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued and pursuing it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well i dont know we get nothing but the fun do we no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing but the fun we do it all he had remarked so beautifully we do it all so beautifully she hadnt denied this for a moment i see what you mean well i mean too he had gone on that we havent no doubt enough the sense of difficulty enough enough for what enough not to be selfish i dont think you are selfish she had returned and had managed not to wail it i dont say that its me particularly or that its you or charlotte or amerigo but were selfish together we move as a selfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had gone on and that holds us that binds us together we want each other he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other thats what i call the happy spell but its also a little possibly the immorality the immorality she had pleasantly echoed well were tremendously moral for ourselves that is for each other and i wont pretend that i know exactly at whose particular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that theres something haunting as if it were a bit uncanny in such a consciousness of our general comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on its only i to whom fantastically it says so much thats all i mean at any rate that its sort of soothing as if we were sitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeing visions let us then be up and doing what is it longfellow says that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breaking in into our opium den to give us a shake but the beauty of it is at the same time that we are doing were doing that is after all what we went in for were working it our life our chance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do than that its a good deal for me he had wound up to have made charlotte so happy to have so perfectly contented her you from a good way back were a matter of course i mean your being all right so that i neednt mind your knowing that my great interest since then has rather inevitably been in making sure of the same success very much to your advantage as well for charlotte if weve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that ive worked my share of it it has not been what you may call least by our having put charlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round that has curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever they are of the opium dont you see what a cropper we would have come if she hadnt settled down as she has and he had concluded by turning to maggie as for something she mightnt really have thought of you darling in that case i verily believe would have been the one to hate it most to hate it maggie had wondered to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not brought it off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even more than for myself thats not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all that you did it he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so well charlotte herself soon enough told me but i never told her her father had answered are you very sure she had presently asked well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her and how right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis i told her all the good i thought of her then that maggie had returned was precisely part of the good i mean it was precisely part of it that she could so beautifully understand yes understand everything everything and in particular your reasons her telling me that showed me how she had understood they were face to face again now and she saw she had made his colour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes the concrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural he should question her further his forbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complication of his fears what she does like he finally said is the way it has succeeded your marriage yes my whole idea the way ive been justified thats the joy i give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think then you could now risk fawns risk it well morally from the point of view i was talking of that of our sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems at its biggest down there maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one corners charlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds that she only wants to know what we want which is what we got her for what we got her for exactly and so for a little even though with a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successful ease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that it was all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for so much comparative solitude ah he had then made answer thats because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than weve hitherto had in the country dont you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for oh yes to give us a life maggie had gone through the form of recalling this and the light of their ancient candour shining from so far back had seemed to bring out some things so strangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risen to her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do he had remained in his place while she looked over his head the picture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration was that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with her companion she was travelling but she was having to steady herself this time before meeting his eyes she had measured indeed the full difference between the move to fawns because each of them now knew the others wanted it and the pairingoff for a journey of her husband and her father which nobody knew that either wanted more company at fawns would be effectually enough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at work there was truly no question but that she and her father must accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry him now what he had just said was a direct plea for that and what was the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte he had from his chair been noting her look but he had the next minute also risen and then it was they had reminded each other of their having come out for the boy their junction with him and with his companion successfully effected the four had moved home more slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness that permitted of maggies reverting an instant to the larger issue if we have people in the country then as you were saying do you know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused but it would be for the castledeans i see but why should i be amused well i mean i am myself i dont think i like her and yet i like to see her which as amerigo says is rum but dont you feel shes very handsome her father inquired yes but it isnt for that then what is it for simply that she may be there just there before us its as if she may have a value as if something may come of her i dont in the least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile i dont even know i admit why but if we see her often enough i may find out does it matter so very much her companion had asked while they moved together she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken it from her yes i guess i do rather like her which she accepted for the first case she could recall of their not being affected by a person in the same way it came back therefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and to add to her appearance of levity she further observed that though they were so far from a novelty she should also immediately desire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that put everything on a basis independent of explanations yet it was extraordinary at the same time how much once in the country again with the others she was going as they used to say at home to need the presence of the good fanny it was the strangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assingham might in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness of charlotte it was as if the two would balance one against the other as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea of the equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into her scale to make weight into the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it would take the three of them to keep that one straight and as this played all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do lets have the assinghams it would be to have them she had said as we used so much to have them for a good long stay in the old way and on the old terms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is if theyll come as regular boarders on the old terms thats what i should like too but i guess theyll come her companion had added in a tone into which she had read meanings the main meaning was that he felt he was going to require them quite as much as she was his recognition of the new terms as different from the old what was that practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helped to create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to an intimation off his guard that he should be thankful for some one to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he had now in short quite given himself away and if she had even at the start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly was enough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retraced their steps swinging the boys hand and not bored as he never was by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine with shrill interrogationpoints so that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightnt have been more real mightnt above all have demanded less strange a study had it only been on the books that charlotte should give him a principino of his own she had repossessed herself now of his other arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to get away from just as he was consciously drawing the child and as high miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home was complacently drawing her the duties of home when the house in portland place reappeared showed even from a distance as vividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come out and the pair were perched together in the balcony he bareheaded she divested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned with a brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggie immediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there to take them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across the rail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of the great black house with an expression that quite broke the monotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portland place the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopled battlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her head most aloft gaped a little through the interval of space as toward truly superior beings there could scarce have been so much of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for pennies the time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of this tradition and purchase a reprieve maggies individual gape was inevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be at work xxx she had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectually in presence as on the afternoon of that ladys return from the easter party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the migration to fawns that of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of the two houses began to be discussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal with an old friend of the old terms she had talked of with her father was the one opening for her spirit that wouldnt too much advertise or betray her even her father who had always as he would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldnt necessarily suspect her of invoking fannys aid toward any special inquiry and least of all if fanny would only act as fanny so easily might maggies measure of fannys ease would have been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at once revealed to her as for that matter it was soon destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing our young womans idea in particular was that her safety her escape from being herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from this friends power to cover to protect and as might be even showily to represent her represent that is her relation to the form of the life they were all actually leading this would doubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be made prevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finest flower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown like abundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered in portland place to the matcham company mrs assingham that night rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery and sympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousness an impression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attempt to undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all these truths that the princess at present approached her again making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know what in especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she in fact quite expressly declared of fannys discerned foreboding of the strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from the first really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can such as i almost wish upon my word that you had something the matter with you that you had lost your health or your money or your reputation forgive me love so that i might be with you as much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for our unselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all as against her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis have seen mrs assinghams personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her was to draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects and agitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth as ready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what she wanted and in the long run which was none so long either there was to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her that she made her fairly responsible for something not to begin with dotting all the is nor hooking together all the links but treating her without insistence rather with caressing confidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that the dear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in all their fortunes so that there was no turn of their common relations and affairs that couldnt be traced back in some degree to her original affectionate interest on this affectionate interest the good ladys young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playing on the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily with an eye on the face of a covertlywatching elder when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature of blocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that the structure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assinghams appearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile on her own side no separate recognitions her face of almost anxious attention was directed altogether to her young friends so vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at the most certain vague recent enhancements of that state if the princess now more than before was going and going she was prompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had always known she would sooner or later and that any appeal for participation must more or less contain and invite the note of triumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly and very nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety a precipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they met again after short separations meetings during the first flush of which maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in other faces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all the physiognomic light that had played out in her husband at the shock she had come at last to talk to herself of the shock of his first vision of her on his return from matcham and gloucester and the wonder of charlottes beautiful bold wavering gaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend had turned from the window to begin to deal with her if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have said that fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might say or do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo and charlotte had been which made exactly an expressive element common to the three the difference however was that this look had in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereas it had never for the least little instant again peeped out of the others other looks other lights radiant and steady with the others had taken its place reaching a climax so short a time ago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony of her house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned to the outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth and welcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not to do anything to startle her and now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to fear their liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecating such an accident not less had yet less assurance as having less control the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the wouldbe smiling order that preceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers or whatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen times to our young womans lips a challenge that had the cunning to await its right occasion but of the relief of which as a demonstration she meanwhile felt no little need youve such a dread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing all the bells to drown my voice but dont cry out my dear till youre hurt and above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked as to complain what in the name of all thats fantastic can you dream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princess temporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in a measure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with which her friend affected her wouldnt be at present a good deal like the ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect her father she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such a takeup as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparing mrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy with this associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent but all inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted from her none the less a vow in respect to the time that if the colonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns and nothing came home to her more in this connection or inspired her with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutely seeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlottes view of a long visit even from such allies was there to be reckoned with fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away from the edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth that contributed again to keep before our young woman her own constant danger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte should have begun to be restrictive about the assinghams which she had never and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and of a value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so much too unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly its price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her to her stepmother more actively if she was to back up her friends for holding out than she had ever yet been opposed though of course with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the moment she should be definitely caught in opposition there would be naturally no saying how much charlottes opportunities might multiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to call his daughter to order and the force of old habit to put it only at that should dispose him not less effectively to believe in this young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible she should give certainly give him the house in the country was his house and thereby was charlottes it was her own and amerigos only so far as its proper master and mistress should profusely place it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw no limit to her fathers profusion but this couldnt be even at the best the case with charlottes whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as not unarmed for battle if battle might only take place without spectators this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of the question her sole strength lay in her being able to see that if charlotte wouldnt want the assinghams it would be because that sentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all the while command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wifes part reported to her by her father it would be open to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons my dear by a lucidlyproduced what are hers love please isnt that what we had better know maynt her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of the observation of persons who perhaps know about her things its inconvenient to her they should know that hideous card she might in mere logic play being by this time at her still swifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingered pasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on the forbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden that it involved even a horror of finding out if he would really have consented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do by keeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see had less in common with that scruple than such a merciless manipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit so boldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion without detachment saw others alone with intensity otherwise she might have been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignment of the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardness of the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage that would improve upon her own they were in short not only themselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but were somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie as well and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant time longer when one afternoon in portland place she broke out with an irrelevance that was merely superficial what awfulness in heavens name is there between them what do you believe what do you know oh if she went by faces her visitors sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it put into the eyes that renewed maggies conviction of what this companion had been expecting she had been watching it come come from afar and now that it was there after all and the first convulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in a more real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheon they had partaken of alone together it was there as strangely as one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse june rain that was making the day wrong it was there because it stood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among which our young woman felt herself lately to have picked her steps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were again paying together alone a week end visit which it had been maggies plan infernally to promote just to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny on her side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad to pay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that the prince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power to describe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred in truth that maggie required the preliminary help of determining how they were though on the other hand before her guest had answered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guests stare of ignorance above all that of itself at first cried it out between them what do you mean anything there shouldnt be there shouldnt have been all this time do you believe there is or whats your idea fannys idea was clearly to begin with that her young friend had taken her breath away but she looked at her very straight and very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out ive been thinking for months and months and ive no one to turn to no one to help me to make things out no impression but my own dont you see to go by youve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham took it in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking well horrible things like a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be something something wrong and dreadful something they cover up the elder womans colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is that it but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to find out what i imagine i dont know ive nothing but my perpetual anxiety have you any do you see what i mean if youll tell me truly that at least one way or the other will do something for me fannys look had taken a peculiar gravity a fulness with which it seemed to shine is what it comes to that youre jealous of charlotte do you mean whether i hate her and maggie thought no not on account of father ah mrs assingham returned that isnt what one would suppose what i ask is if youre jealous on account of your husband well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if im unhappy im jealous it must come to the same thing and with you at least im not afraid of the word if im jealous dont you see im tormented she went on and all the more if im helpless and if im both helpless and tormented i stuff my pockethandkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the most part night and day so as not to be heard too indecently moaning only now with you at last i cant keep it longer ive pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you theyre away she wound up so they cant hear and im by a miracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home i live in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which i admit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem as smooth as old satin dyed rosecolour have you ever thought of me she asked as really feeling as i do her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the same time and though you may laugh at me for it im bound to confess that ive never been so awfully sure of what i may call knowing you here you are indeed as you say such a deep little person ive never imagined your existence poisoned and since you wish to know if i consider that it need be ive not the least difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie had sprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving to and fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she had invoked it had accumulated considerably by this time round mrs assinghams ample presence and it made even to our young womans own sense a medium in which she could at last take a deeper breath ive affected you these months and these last weeks in especial as quiet and natural and easy but it was a question that took not imperceptibly some answering youve never affected me from the first hour i beheld you as anything but in a way all your own absolutely good and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assingham almost caressingly repeated just all your very own nobody elses at all ive never thought of you but as outside of ugly things so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity as never to have to be touched by them or to touch them ive never mixed you up with them there would have been time enough for that if they had seemed to be near you but they havent if thats what you want to know youve only believed me contented then because youve believed me stupid mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of this stride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful little frisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldnt have thought you interesting and if i hadnt thought you interesting i shouldnt have noted whether i knew you as ive called it or not what ive always been conscious of is your having concealed about you somewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able to carry the only thing was she explained that thanks to your never calling ones attention to it i hadnt made out much more about it and should have been vague above all as to where you carried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply have said like that little silver cross you once showed me blest by the holy father that you always wear out of sight next your skin that relic ive had a glimpse of with which she continued to invoke the privilege of humour but the precious little innermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the pope that youve never consentingly shown me im not sure youve ever consentingly shown it to anyone youve been in general too modest maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of her forehead i strike you as modest today modest when i stand here and scream at you oh your screaming ive granted you is something new i must fit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assingham further proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do you mean she asked to the fact of our friends being from yesterday to tomorrow at a place where they may more or less irresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it as badly for them as possible are you thinking of their being there alone of their having consented to be and then as she had waited without result for her companion to say but isnt it true that after you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldnt they would really much rather not have gone yes they would certainly much rather not have gone but i wanted them to go then my dear child what in the world is the matter i wanted to see if they would and theyve had to maggie added it was the only thing her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and your father backed out oh i dont mean go for those people i mean go for us for father and me maggie went on because now they know they know fanny assingham quavered that ive been for some time past taking more notice notice of the queer things in our life maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of asking her what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had the next minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as she evidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it i mean gave up the visit its for that i did it to leave them to themselves as they less and less want or at any rate less and less venture to appear to want to be left as they had for so long arranged things the princess went on you see they sometimes have to be and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think im modest with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything that would serve i think youre wrong that my dear is my answer to your question it demands assuredly the straightest i can make i see no awfulness i suspect none im deeply distressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look youve never even imagined anything ah god forbid for its exactly as a woman of imagination that i speak theres no moment of my life at which im not imagining something and its thanks to that darling mrs assingham pursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother is interested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorable wife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefit of this as to maggies measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her effort he wouldnt hurt a hair of your head it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in the intended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is but her guest had already gone on and im absolutely certain that charlotte wouldnt either it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there no charlotte wouldnt either thats how theyve had again to go off together theyve been afraid not to lest it should disturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insisted that they must that we couldnt all fail though father and charlotte hadnt really accepted as i did this they had to yield to the fear that their showing as afraid to move together would count for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger they know is in going on with all the things that ive seemed to accept and that ive given no indication at any moment of not accepting everything that has come up for them has come up in an extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a sign given myself away so that its all as wonderful as you may conceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not having any longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may call it to do enough her tone by this time might have shown a strangeness to match her smile which was still more marked as she wound up and thats how i make them do what i like it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with the deliberation that from point to point marked the widening of her grasp my dear child youre amazing amazing youre terrible maggie thoughtfully shook her head no im not terrible and you dont think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild because dont you see i am mild i can bear anything oh bear mrs assingham fluted for love said the princess fanny hesitated of your father for love maggie repeated it kept her friend watching of your husband for love maggie said again it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might have determined in her companion a choice between two or three highly different alternatives mrs assinghams rejoinder at all events however much or however little it was a choice was presently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your fathers wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other and then as the princess didnt at first answer do you call such an allegation as that mild oh im not pretending to be mild to you but ive told you and moreover you must have seen for yourself how much so ive been to them mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what you call it when you make them for terror as you say do as you like ah there wouldnt be any terror for them if they had nothing to hide mrs assingham faced her quite steady now are you really conscious love of what youre saying im saying that im bewildered and tormented and that ive no one but you to speak to ive thought ive in fact been sure that youve seen for yourself how much this is the case its why ive believed you would meet me half way half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom ive always immensely admired and liked and against whom i havent the shadow of a charge to make maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather you should denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what she appeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a lowminded little pig well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused for emphasis i think i shall be saved her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtful eyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say youve no one to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguised your feelings not having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as your bounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to your husband ive spoken to him said maggie mrs assingham stared ah then it isnt true that youve made no sign maggie had a silence ive made no trouble ive made no scene ive taken no stand ive neither reproached nor accused him youll say theres a way in all that of being nasty enough oh dropped from fanny as if she couldnt help it but i dont think strangely enough that he regards me as nasty i think that at bottom for that is said the princess the strangeness hes sorry for me yes i think that deep within he pities me her companion wondered for the state youve let yourself get into for not being happy when ive so much to make me so youve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet she remained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance i dont understand however how if youve done nothing an impatience from maggie had checked her ive not done absolutely nothing but what then well she went on after a minute he knows what ive done it produced on mrs assinghams part her whole tone and manner exquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the very duration of which inevitably gave it something of the character of an equal recognition and what then has he done maggie took again a minute he has been splendid splendid then what more do you want ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really to speak not to be afraid not to speak mrs assingham considered further you cant even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with a movement of suppressed despair she checked herself and might have been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity of it vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure of responsive wit in her friend the last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tone that seemed most to promise her she should have to give up nothing i see i see you would have in that case too many things to consider it brought the princess round again proving itself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutch at dont be afraid maggie took it where she stood which she was soon able to signify thankyou it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your idea imputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amid perfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but under your fathers thats an idea its impossible for me for a moment to entertain ah there you are then its exactly what i wanted from you youre welcome to it mrs assingham breathed you never have entertained it maggie pursued never for an instant said fanny with her head very high maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my being so horrid but by all you hold sacred mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word as an honest woman thankyou then said the princess so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired i believe you well as ive faith in them it comes to the same thing maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again but she embraced the proposition the same thing then youre no longer unhappy her guest urged coming more gaily toward her i doubtless shant be a great while but it was now mrs assinghams turn to want more ive convinced you its impossible she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meeting her threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity as a sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she had burst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend xxxi the understanding appeared to have come to be that the colonel and his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of july for the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtained from her father that he should genially insist as well as that the couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in the month and less than a week after their own arrival the advent of the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time to breathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism to each member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herself by her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of the confident view of these punctualities of the assinghams the ground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her being moved as in this connexion she had always been moved by the admitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of the ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destitute as the colonel had kept her from the first of any rustic retreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the stale season now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedly reexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty of her or as she now put it of their position when the pair could do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk of marvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic the momentous midnight discussion at which we have been present was so far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at all private hours they had planted it there between them and it grew from day to day in a manner to make their sense of responsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of this admirable young thing to whom she also declared she had quite come over she was ready to pass with all the world else even with the prince himself the object inconsequently as well of her continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for a vulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her true character in an abandoned old age the colonels confessed attention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet under pressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because he was sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldnt keep his eyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently on the princess if he was in love with her now however so much the better it would help them both not to wince at what they would have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggies little march was positively beguiling let him lose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as ive again and again told you to lie for her to lie till were black in the face to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from a vague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered into apparent lapses from lucidity to lie to her up and down and in and out it comes to the same thing it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about ones belief in him to charlotte about ones belief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about ones belief in everyone so weve work cut out with the biggest lie on top of all being that we like to be there for such a purpose we hate it unspeakably im more ready to be a coward before it to let the whole thing to let everyone selfishly and pusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felt human call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak at least for myself for you she had added as ive given you so perfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie youll doubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her and what do you make the colonel could at this always imperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will find in being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if not exasperated infatuation with whom to say nothing of my weak goodnature about it you give such a pretty picture to the picture in question she had been always in fact able contemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment of that is dont you see that im making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie oh about that particular crime there is always much to say it is always more interesting to us than any other crime it has at least that for it but of course i call everything i have in mind at all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more than anything else helping her with her father which is what she most wants and needs the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never have too much of it helping her with him helping her against him then against what weve already so fully talked of its having to be recognised between them that he doubts thats where my part is so plain to see her through to see her through to the end exaltation for the moment always lighted mrs assinghams reference to this plainness yet she at the same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify her view of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean that its absolute for just how from day to day and through thick and thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter theres one way luckily nevertheless in which im strong i can perfectly count on her the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth of an excitement to wonder to encourage not to see youre lying to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to her that is to my own poor struggling way under providence of watching over them all shell stand by me to the death she wont give me away for you know she easily can this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bob assingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let him know that i was aware at the time of his marriage as i had been aware at the time of her own of the relations that had preexisted between his wife and her husband and how can she do so if up to this minute by your own statement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grand effect very much as if she was invited by it to say that about this exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could give itself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which in her place ninetynine women out of a hundred would act and by so making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninetynine men out of a hundred theyve only to agree about me the poor lady said theyve only to feel at one over it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured theyve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course its i who have been and who continue to be cheated cheated by the prince and charlotte but theyre not obliged to give me the benefit of that or to give either of us the benefit of anything theyll be within their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to support them get rid of us root and branch this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst that repetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which she was compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its ugly consistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making it real to her husband and of his almost turning pale when their eyes met at this possibility of their compromised state and their shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch of one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he sounded out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiring so far as you were concerned to what end why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wife at maggies expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husband at mr ververs of rendering friendly services yes which have produced as it turns out complications but from the moment you didnt do it for the complications why shouldnt you have rendered them it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than she could in the presence of her clearcut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never wholly failed of her amusement by the way oh isnt what i may have meddled for so far as it can be proved i did meddle open to interpretation by which i mean to mr ververs and maggies maynt they see my motive in the light of that appreciation as the wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to the victimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep it up maynt they see my motive as the determination to serve the prince in any case and at any price first to place him comfortably in other words to find him his fill of money maynt it have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinister bargain between us something quite unholy and louche it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love why havent you said as much yourself havent you put your finger on that awful possibility she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy being reminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put so splendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at it would show it only as likely to have been but were not talking of course about impartial looks were talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going much further in their view of the lurid as such people almost always do than those who have been wider awake all round from the first what i was to have got from my friend in such a view in exchange for what i had been able to do for him well that would have been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for me shrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time in the anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it would have been seen it would have been heard of before the case of the woman a man doesnt want or of whom hes tired or for whom he has no use but such uses and who is capable in her infatuation in her passion of promoting his interests with other women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela sest vu my dear and stranger things still as i neednt tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of the behaviour of your sweet wife since as i say theres no imagination so lively once its started as that of really agitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions are sophisticated are blases are brought up from the first to prowling and mauling it does give us youll admit something to think about my relief is luckily however in what i finally do think he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally did think but he was not without a sense again also for his amusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator of these passages between the pair resemble not a little the artless child who hears his favourite story told for the twentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what is next to happen what of course will pull them up if they turn out to have less imagination than you assume is the profit you can have found in furthering mrs ververs marriage you werent at least in love with charlotte oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand in that is easily accounted for by my desire to be agreeable to him to mr verver to the prince by preventing her in that way from taking as he was in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom he wouldnt be able to open to keep open so large an account as with his fatherinlaw ive brought her near him kept her within his reach as she could never have remained either as a single woman or as the wife of a different man kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress she brought it out grandly it had always so for her own ear as well as visibly for her husbands its effect the facilities in the case thanks to the particular conditions being so quite ideal down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of view as to have supplied him with the enjoyment of two beautiful women down even to that to the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune thats what a creature of pure virtue exposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers her sympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for the lives of others to carry her too far voila i see its the way the ververs have you its the way the ververs have me its in other words the way they would be able to make such a show to each other of having me if maggie werent so divine she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to the very end which was how he had become so versed in what she finally thought she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at what ive done i may work to help her out and mr verver she was fond of adding lets me off too then you do believe he knows it determined in her always there with a significant pause a deep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off if he did know so that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie that would be his motive that would be his condition in forgiving me just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but its with maggie only that im directly concerned nothing ever not a breath not a look ill guarantee shall i have whatever happens from mr verver himself so it is therefore that i shall probably by the closest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes you mean being held responsible i mean being held responsible my advantage will be that maggies such a trump such a trump that as you say shell stick to you stick to me on our understanding stick to me for our understandings signed and sealed and to brood over it again was ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation its a grand high compact she has solemnly promised but in words oh yes in words enough since its a matter of words to keep up her lie so long as i keep up mine and what do you call her lie why the pretence that she believes me believes theyre innocent she positively believes then theyre guilty she has arrived at that shes really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered but always at last to get the matter for her own sense and with a long sigh sufficiently straight it isnt a question of belief or of proof absent or present its inevitably with her a question of natural perception of insurmountable feeling she irresistibly knows that theres something between them but she hasnt arrived at it as you say at all thats exactly what she hasnt done what she so steadily and intensely refuses to do she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out to sea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is to keep at a safe distance with her as i for my own skin only ask not to come nearer after which invariably she let him have it all so far from wanting proof which she must get in a manner by my siding with her she wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her its really magnificent when you come to think of it the spirit of her appeal if ill but cover them up brazenly enough the others so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if ill keep them quiet in a word it will enable her to gain time time as against any idea of her fathers and so somehow come out if ill take care of charlotte in particular shell take care of the prince and its beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite to see what she feels that time may do for her ah but what does she call poor little thing time well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out for herself i think that the very danger of fawns superficially looked at may practically amount to a greater protection there the lovers if they are lovers will have to mind theyll feel it for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone with them and things are not too utterly far gone with them she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but she put down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutely indispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no it made him always grin at her is that a lie do you think youre worth lying to if it werent the truth for me she added i wouldnt have accepted for fawns i can i believe keep the wretches quiet but how at the worst oh the worst dont talk about the worst i can keep them quiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there it will work from week to week of itself youll see he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yet if it doesnt work ah thats talking about the worst well it might be but what were they doing from morning to night at this crisis but talk wholl keep the others the others wholl keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they cant have had it completely without witnesses without the help of persons however few who must have some knowledge some idea about them theyve had to meet secretly protectedly theyve had to arrange for if they havent met and havent arranged and havent thereby in some quarter or other had to give themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore if theres evidence up and down london there must be people in possession of it ah it isnt all she always remembered up and down london some of it must connect them i mean she musingly added it naturally would with other places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh theyve known how too beautifully but nothing all the same is likely to find its way to maggie of itself because every one who may have anything to tell you hold will have been so squared and then inveterately before she could say he enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squared lady castledean the consciousness she had never lost her promptness of having no stones to throw at any one elses windows she has enough to do to guard her own glass that was what she was doing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of us went off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helped them simply that she might herself be helped if it wasnt perhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got it clear and quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didnt become traceable again as we know till late in the evening on this historic circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh to brood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly to add only we know nothing whatever else for which all our stars be thanked the colonels gratitude was apt to be less marked what did they do for themselves all the same from the moment they got that free hand to the moment long after dinnertime havent you told me of their turning up at their respective homes well its none of your business i dont speak of it as mine but its only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings are required something sooner or later happens somebody sooner or later breaks the holy calm murder will out murder will but this isnt murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for the amusement of the row you would prefer an explosion this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up for the most part after a long contemplative smoke with a transition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded in weaning him what i cant for my life make out is your idea of the old boy charlottes too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea i beg your pardon youve just shown it you never speak of him but as too inconceivably funny well he is she always confessed that is he may be for all i know too inconceivably great but thats not an idea it represents only my weak necessity of feeling that hes beyond me which isnt an idea either you see he may be stupid too precisely there you are yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have already been but we shall never know with which her tone betrayed perhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didnt yearningly welcome that i can see oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a sense of privation im not sure even that charlotte will oh my dear what charlotte doesnt know but she brooded and brooded im not sure even that the prince will it seemed privation in short for them all theyll be mystified confounded tormented but they wont know and all their possible putting their heads together wont make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and she ended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch it will probably also if i get off with so little be mine and what her husband liked to ask will be mine nothing youre not worthy of any ones punishment is in what one feels and what will make ours effective is that we shall feel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with this prophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out maggie shell know about her father everything everything she repeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham as with the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but shell never tell us xxxii if maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say either to her good friend or to any one else more than she meant about her father she might have found herself betrayed into some such overflow during the week spent in london with her husband after the others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this was because of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the so simple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions resident in their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but she dropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parent might be alone with them she thought of him as alone with them when she thought of him as alone with charlotte and this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on his wifes power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitous appearance charlotte had done that under immeasurably fewer difficulties indeed during the numerous months of their hymeneal absence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunion of the couples in the interest of the larger play of all the virtues of each which was now bearing for mrs ververs stepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the present so much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changed it was the new terms of her problem that would tax charlottes art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father and his wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that in strictness was none of her business but she none the less failed to keep quiet as she would have called it before the projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothing could have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain queer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish that usurped perversely the place of a much more natural one if charlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that she might desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it was to feel in such ways she believed she mightnt have worried so much if she didnt somehow make her stepmother out under the beautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish of fifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least of gentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the right thing as from a charming woman to her husband but the fine tissue of reassurance woven by this ladys hands and flung over her companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely a wrought transparency through which she felt her fathers eyes continually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to her straighter from a distance it showed him as still more conscious down there alone of the suspected the felt elaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfect success in giving no sign she did herself that credit would have been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should make with him those mistakes of proportion one set of them too abruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set that she had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to a certainty have been better one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actually not even definite for the princess that her own amerigo left alone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean of nonprecautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perchingplace the truth was in this connection that she had different sorts of terrors and there were hours when it came to her that these days were a prolonged repetition of that nightdrive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charm her by his sovereign personal power into some collapse that would commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was never alone with him it was to be said without her having sooner or later to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge she kept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her from attack attack real attack from him as he would conduct it was what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure that under that experience she mightnt drop into some depth of weakness mightnt show him some shortest way with her that he would know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moments pretext for pretending to her that she had either lost faith or suffered by a feathers weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantage for all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what makingup might lead into what consenting or pretending or destroying blindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating her as if either of them had wronged the other something or somebody and who at this which of them all would inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed to that whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where she was going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as a fear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncture was the way her apprehension that he would break out to her with some merely general profession was mixed with her dire need to forgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no ground that she didnt fully measure to do these things it must be clear to her what they were for but to act in that light was by the same effect to learn horribly what the other things had been he might tell her only what he wanted only what would work upon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of the direct appeal of any beauty in him would be her helpless submission to his terms all her temporary safety her handtomouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nor divining this thanks to such means as she could take to prevent him take literally from hour to hour during these days of more unbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected some sign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as you think ive strayed away ive fancied myself free given myself in other quantities with larger generosities because i thought you were different different from what i now see but it was only only because i didnt know and you must admit that you gave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keep clear of my mistake to which i confess for which ill do exquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifully feel to get completely over that was what while she watched herself she potentially heard him bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together without his producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond even the intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for a reason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with the labour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together in the steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passion would have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger or at least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of the thought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of his attention to her couldnt help being a sense of the growth of her importance taking the measure with him as she had taken it with her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy she saw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to prove that she was not all the same important a single touch from him oh she should know it in case of its coming any brush of his hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition of her probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtual gloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot therefore to be free to be free to act other than abjectly for her father she must conceal from him the validity that like a microscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking on even for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldnt keep it up forever so that really one extraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out in thought to their customary companions and calculate the kind of relief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almost from minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master of shades too and on whom if she didnt look out she should presently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of their struggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this fineness to see him at all in short brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering of her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in their so occult manner a high fight and that it was she all the while in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and was keeping it high in the event of his doing this before they could leave town she should verily be lost the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the fact that observation in him there would inevitably find some of its directness diverted this would be the case if only because the remarkable strain of her fathers placidity might be thought of as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besides which there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could see that this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree to protect the secret of her own fermentation it is not even incredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfort that was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the princes spirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of the very airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs ververs too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of the privilege of watching that lady watch her very well then with the elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go on enjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this time made up her mind that in charlottes company he deferred to charlottes easier art of mounting guard wouldnt he get tired to put it only at that of seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her laceflounced parasol now folded and now shouldered march to and fro against a goldcoloured east or west maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question of this particular reaction and she was not incapable of pulling herself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens before they were hatched how sure she should have to be of so many things before she might thus find a weariness in amerigos expression and a logic in his weariness one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly as possible with the undulations of their surface to bring it about that she should join them of an afternoon when they drove together or if they went to look at things looking at things being almost as much a feature of their life as if they were bazaaropening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonels as well for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matter who was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about the british drama the good couple from cadogan place could always unprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to such publicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of now perversely preferring it may be said of her that during these passages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that she could smile over them at least with the spacious appearance for her companions for her husband above all of bravely of altogether frivolously going amaying she had her intense her smothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments the amused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might be forever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put it all off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforth appraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in her blameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus only signified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her she didnt care for what devotions what dinners of their own the assinghams might have been booked that was a detail and she could think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements to which her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of the glitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creative hand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself of presenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman and their lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte during so many weeks of the earlier season worked her up herself assuming and discharging so far as might be the character and office of one of those revolving subordinate presences that float in the wake of greatness the precedent was therefore established and the group normally constituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the operabox might with her constant overflow of expression for that matter and its singularly resident character where men in especial were concerned look across at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of that maggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she might rebuke him she might reassure him she might if it were impossible not to absolutely make love to him even this was open to her as a matter simply between them if it would help her to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggie desired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacy of her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a small project for the morrow privately entertained the idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit to mr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easily remember was the most accomplished and obliging of public functionaries whom every one knew and who knew every one who had from the first in particular lent himself freely and for the love of art and history to becoming one of the steadier lights of mr ververs adventurous path the custodian of one of the richest departments of the great national collection of precious things he could feel for the sincere private collector and urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at his capture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentary thrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time to time its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to see such lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with the tormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous the already famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm in his almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sure or almost again of enjoying the monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed to sympathy by the more familiar view of the father and the daughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially in eaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestive character it was at his invitation fanny well recalled that maggie one day long before and under her own attendance precisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visit to one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple an alcove of shelves charged with the goldandbrown goldandivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records of the princes race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at its having to be so superficial she was to go back some day to dive deeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had been repeated this second occasion had given way for a long time in her happy life to other occasions all testifying in their degree to the quality of her husbands blood its rich mixture and its many remarkable references after which no doubt the charming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversation with mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly and maggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own to the success of which she designed to devote her morning visits of gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily for this perhaps most flowerloving and honeysipping member of the great bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and though not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found herself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothing was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding urbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigos company fanny was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last fact for one of the finer notes of her young womans detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of irony that in these ambiguous days her husbands personal presence might be felt to confer practically on any tribute to his transmitted significance then as the next moment she felt it clear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement of reflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might still survive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily fell and she congratulated her companion on having anything so exquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to do it after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in her optimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent among the projected lights the annals and illustrations the parchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmured commentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but very firmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any one you like or you can it doesnt in the least matter whom and the pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with a docility not in the least ruffled by all that it took for granted it provided for an evening this had been maggies view and she lived up to her view in her friends eyes by treating the occasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the good assinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scale so disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own that it was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home how they met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dined with them in short and arrived at making her husband appear to dine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposed themselves to a pair of faithfullyserving subjects she showed an interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almost for their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as they might have said put it all down the tone and the freedom of which she set the example to the effect wrought in her afresh by one of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of the past hadnt she picked it up from an anecdote or two offered again to her attention that there were for princesses of such a line more ways than one of being a heroine maggies way tonight was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance of her affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted her being graceful she had never seen her put so much of it into being what might have been called assertive it was all a tune to which fannys heart could privately palpitate her guest was happy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred but she was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh though not perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely not foolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he was scarce the man to brook his wifes being thought to be so that there hovered before their friend the possibility of some subsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home of slightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation a scene that according as maggie should play her part in it might or might not precipitate developments what made these appearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mystery a mystery it was clear to amerigo himself of the incident or the influence that had so peculiarly determined them the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however within three days and the page was turned for her on the eve of her young confidants leaving london the awaited migration to fawns was to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile to mrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so that the elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from the younger under date of six oclock a telegram requesting her immediate attendance please come to me at once dress early if necessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered for us will take you back first mrs assingham on quick deliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity and by seven oclock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engaged in dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poor fanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that her feared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that her impossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hour of its coming out that she had known of old so much more than she had ever said and she had often put it to herself in apprehension she tried to think even in preparation that she should recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akin to that of the blowing open of a window on some night of the highest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vain to have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have been smashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggies room then on her going up was not as yet quite the polar blast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such an atmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together the princess she perceived was completely dressed that business was over it added indeed to the effect of her importantly awaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deck cleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room where everything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it that she had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones in her hair a question her visitor presently answered by attributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot red as some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their own light for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing more pathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise her agitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her idea that of not betraying herself by inattentions into which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circled about and furnished forth as always in a manner that testified to her perfect little personal processes it had ever been her sign that she was for all occasions found ready without loose ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities a suggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yet thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting that reflected her small still passion for order and symmetry for objects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of some probable reference in her american blood to dusting and polishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked as if she had been carried there prepared all attired and decorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure her friend felt how could she not as the truly pious priest might feel when confronted behind the altar before the festa with his miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave in general with all the gravity of what he might look for but the gravity tonight would be of the rarest what he might look for would depend so on what he could give xxxiii something very strange has happened and i think you ought to know it maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with the effect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fannys faith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end of five minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence had consisted of and how it had all come of maggies achieved hour under mr crichtons protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderful show after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attending her to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement of taking her way alone she had known she should find herself as the consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streets would be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody to talk to and shopwindows in plenty to look at if she liked a low taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable to gratify she had taken her leave with her thanks she knew her way quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that she had even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a little wild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear of oxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts she didnt know she had ended with what she had more or less had been fancying an encounter with three or four shops an old booksellers an old printmongers a couple of places with dim antiquities in the window that were not as so many of the other shops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which had long since ceased to beguile there had remained with her moreover an allusion of charlottes of some months before seed dropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech about there being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating places and even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhaps have been no stronger mark than this sense of wellnigh romantic opportunity no livelier sign of the impression made on her and always so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observation of charlottes however lightly thrown off and then she had felt somehow more at her ease than for months and months before she didnt know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadnt come into so many noble and beautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanity and doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed in him again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him she said with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as i walked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment to wonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on my mind it was so much as if everything would come out right that she had fallen to thinking of her fathers birthday had given herself this as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it they would keep it at fawns where they had kept it before since it would be the twentyfirst of the month and she mightnt have another chance of making sure of something to offer him there was always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldnt already long ago in his rummagings have seen himself and only not to think a quarter good enough this however was an old story and one could not have had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that the individual gift the friendships offering was by a rigorous law of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it was so the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour of affection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were the bravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glass cases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of the temple dedicated to the grimacing not to the clearfaced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to be much represented in those receptacles against the thick locked panes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding in its place each time everything she had on successive anniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at her suggestion to be put off with or at least think curious she was now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasure in her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayal of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played the game so happily to this end on her way home she had loitered everywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the old prints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with a strange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a small antiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her a number of things shown her finally something that struck with it as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some of her ventures quite superlatively do she had bought bought really when it came to that for a price it appears now it wont do at all said maggie something has happened since that puts it quite out of the question i had only my day of satisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep it here before me that i wouldnt have missed it for the world she had talked from the first of her friends entrances coherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated her calm but she held her breath every few seconds as if for deliberation and to prove she didnt pant all of which marked for fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to her thought about her father about her chance to pick up something that might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitude under presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speakers lips than a power to produce on the part of the listener herself the prompt response and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of old amused observation the picture was filled out by the latters fond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew what she was doing and had already her plan a plan for making for allowing as yet no difference in accordance with which she would still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsed features nor neglected items of appearance nor anything that would raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fall of lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assinghams eyes that she herself should have at whatever risk or whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need all our friends instinct was to hold off from this till she should see what the ground would bear she would take no step nearer unless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might be to hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities of vagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not as yet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to she caught however after a seconds thought at the princesss allusion to her lost reassurance you mean you were so at your ease on monday the night you dined with us i was very happy then said maggie yes we thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt it feeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thought me all right eh surely dearest we thought you all right well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never was more wrong in my life for all the while if you please this was brewing mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury her vagueness this that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimneypiece of the room of which among so many precious objects the ververs wherever they might be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantel ornaments her visitor had not taken heed do you mean the gilt cup i mean the gilt cup the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was a capacious bowl of oldlooking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a central position above the fireplace where to allow it the better to show a clearance had been made of other objects notably of the louisseize clock that accompanied the candelabra this latter trophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode that exactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham took it the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously not of its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it at a distance but what has that to do it has everything youll see with which again however for the moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knew her before before i had ever seen him he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the links she missed could only echo it amerigo knew charlotte more than i ever dreamed fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you always knew they had met i didnt understand i knew too little dont you see what i mean the princess asked mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she even now knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she was speaking with that perception of its being no challenge of wrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure of the completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if it must the elder woman felt first a strange barely credible relief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of a flower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she should turn any consequence of judgment she shouldnt be judged save by herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediate cowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinking that is of pitifully seeing that she was in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterly accepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes but not a in connexion with what youve been telling me they were intimate you see intimate said the princess fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes this history so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of the faraway other time theres always the question of what one considers what one considers intimate well i know what i consider intimate now too intimate said maggie to let me know anything about it it was quiet yes but not too quiet for fanny assinghams capacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the new ornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relief from it at this gap in her experience but here are things my dear of which my ignorance is perfect they went about together theyre known to have done it and i dont mean only before i mean after after said fanny assingham before we were married yes but after we were engaged ah ive known nothing about that and she said it with a braver assurance clutching with comfort at something that was apparently new to her that bowl maggie went on is so strangely too strangely almost to believe at this time of day the proof they were together all the while up to the very eve of our marriage dont you remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america the question had for mrs assingham and whether all consciously or not the oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of course i remember how she came back from america and how she stayed with us and what view one had of it maggies eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated so that during a moment just here she might have given the little flare have made the little pounce of asking what then ones view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quickly cease to threaten quite saw the princess even though in all her pain refuse in the interest of their strange and exalted bargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting the stab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself she saw her or she believed she saw her look at her chance for straight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and she felt herself with this fact hushed wellnigh to awe at the lucid higher intention that no distress could confound and that no discovery since it was however obscurely a case of discovery could make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew our friends sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the function again imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms on which she was let off her quantity of release having made its sufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlottes old reappearance and deep within the whole impression glowed ah so inspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from the first of the beauty of her companions motive it was like a fresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you a hand of which the freedom isnt to be said the aggravation of fear or call it apparently of knowledge had jumped straight into its place as an aggravation above all for her father the effect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons for making his protectedness or in other words the forms of his ignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to her solution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and these forms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horse grasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely have been putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay on if they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still of what she had definitely met fanny yearned within over her spirit and so no word about it said passed through mere pitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with a lantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggies reply they spent together hours spent at least a morning the certainty of which has come back to me now but that i didnt dream of it at the time that cup there has turned witness by the most wonderful of chances thats why since it has been here ive stood it out for my husband to see put it where it would meet him almost immediately if he should come into the room ive wanted it to meet him she went on and ive wanted him to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but that hasnt taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the way of coming to see me here yes in particular lately he hasnt showed today it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talked an achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support and thereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance in the facts she could add together its quite as if he had an instinct something that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesnt quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isnt in a hurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keeps off but being meanwhile in the house ive no idea not having seen him today by exception since before luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freely explained of a ballot of great importance at a club for somebody some personal friend i think whos coming up and is supposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought he had better lunch there you see the efforts he can make for which maggie found a smile that went to her friends heart hes in so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming in and finding me here i dont know you see what you now consider that youve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it of that object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on this odd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and again turned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid and definite in its domination of the scene fanny could no more overlook it now than she could have overlooked a lighted christmastree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into her mind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time that this attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she even not a little shared the princes mystic apprehension the golden bowl put on under consideration a sturdy a conscious perversity as a document somehow it was ugly though it might have a decorative grace his finding me here in presence of it might be more flagrantly disagreeable for all of us than you intend or than would necessarily help us and i must take time truly to understand what it means youre safe as far as that goes maggie returned you may take it from me that he wont come in and that i shall only find him below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage fanny assingham took it from her took it and more were to sit together at the ambassadors then or at least you two are with this new complication thrust up before you all unexplained and to look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastly hour not to be seeing it maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one she was preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothing really to add my own love she kept it up i dont want anything more ive plenty to go upon and to do with as it is fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with her links verily still missing but the most acceptable effect of this was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer the fact but when you come home i mean hell come up with you again wont he see it then on which maggie gave her after an instants visible thought the strangest of slow headshakes i dont know perhaps hell never see it if it only stands there waiting for him he may never again said the princess come into this room fanny more deeply wondered never again oh yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but there was a marvel to her friend in the way the little word representing it seemed to express and include for her the whole of her situation then you intend not to speak to him maggie waited to speak well about your having it and about what you consider that it represents oh i dont know that i shall speak if he doesnt but his keeping away from me because of that what will that be but to speak he cant say or do more it wont be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that had already so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on that object that you regard for your reasons as evidence i think i may say that i depend on it i cant said maggie treat it as nothing now mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without going closer to her companions vision she looked at the precious thing if precious it was found herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather than suffer the imposition of maggies knowledge it was brave and rich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queer torment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession really desirable she didnt touch it but if after a minute she turned away from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in her fear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean your future does for thats what it comes to i judge what it comes to maggie presently returned is what that thing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so much between them before there cant with all the other appearances not be a great deal more now and she went on and on she steadily made her points if such things were already then between them they make all the difference for possible doubt of what may have been between them since if there had been nothing before there might be explanations but it makes today too much to explain i mean to explain away she said fanny assingham was there to explain away of this she was duly conscious for that at least had been true up to now in the light however of maggies demonstration the quantity even without her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seem larger than ever besides which with or without exactness the effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more in presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw the truth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assinghams relation to it there was a force in the princesss mere manner about it that made the detail of what she knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in fact something like a momentary shame over her own need of asking for this detail i dont pretend to repudiate she said after a little my own impressions of the different times i suppose you speak of any more she added than i can forget what difficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of action whatever i should decide upon made for me i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back to her and you know i believe its what i shall turn out to have done this produced a minute during which their interchange though quickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggie at last spoke im sure you tried to act for the best it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i never thought dearest you werent an angel not however that this alone was much help it was up to the very eve you see the princess went on up to within two or three days of our marriage that that you know and she broke down for strangely smiling yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didnt know it that is said fanny assingham i didnt know of anything in particular it sounded weak that she felt but she had really her point to make what i mean is that i dont know for knowledge now anything i didnt then thats how i am she still however floundered i mean its how i was but dont they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder womans words had struck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothing definitely to disprove the situation had changed by well by whatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and this could keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as she pursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on that it was on that but they came back to her visitor and it was on it all that father married her her visitor took it as might be they both married ah that you must believe with the highest intentions father did certainly and then at the renewal of this consciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such things on us to do them here between us and with us day after day and in return in return to do it to him to him to him fanny hesitated you mean its for him you most suffer and then as the princess after a look but turned away moving about the room which made the question somehow seem a blunder i ask she continued because i think everything everything we now speak of may be for him really may be made for him quite as if it hadnt been but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearing her father did it for me did it all and only for me mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head but she faltered again before she spoke well it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instant that it had reached her do you mean that thats the reason that thats a reason fanny at first however feeling the response in this didnt say all she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for you largely at least for you and it was for you that i did in my smaller interested way well what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw your interest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlottes i believed in her and i believed in her said maggie mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on she believed then in herself ah maggie murmured something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity of it supported her friend further and the prince believed his belief was real just as he believed in himself maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed in himself just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoined well i mean i do maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end and do you believe in charlotte yet mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford well talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time then why did they keep from me everything i might have known her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keep it from you oh you werent for honour obliged dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you are divine they pretended to love me the princess went on and they pretended to love him and pray what was there that i didnt pretend not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo and for charlotte they were much more interesting it was perfectly natural how couldnt you like amerigo maggie continued mrs assingham gave it up how couldnt i how couldnt i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how cant i how cant i it fixed afresh maggies wide eyes on her i see i see well its beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte yes fanny considered it i wanted to help charlotte but i wanted also you see to help you by not digging up a past that i believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one it set maggie once more in movement movement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then its a good deal my fault if everything really began so well fanny assingham met it as she could youve been only too perfect youve thought only too much but the princess had already caught at the words yes ive thought only too much yet she appeared to continue for the minute full of that fault she had it in fact by this prompted thought all before her of him dear man of him her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of her father watched her with a new suspense that way might safety lie it was like a wider chink of light he believed with a beauty in charlotte yes and it was i who had made him believe i didnt mean to at the time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming but i did it i did it the princess declared with a beauty ah with a beauty you too mrs assingham insisted maggie however was seeing for herself it was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible fanny again hesitated the prince made her think maggie stared she had meant her father but her vision seemed to spread they both made her think she wouldnt have thought without them yet amerigos good faith mrs assingham insisted was perfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your fathers the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothing perhaps but his knowing that she knew knew that he was doing it so much for me to what extent she suddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that she knew ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous and mrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much as was right for himself as much that is as was right for her yes then as was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went for his good faith maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on her successive movements isnt the point very considerably that his good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost as much interest in me as he himself took fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your long friendship but he founded on it no selfishness no said maggie with still deeper consideration he counted her selfishness out almost as he counted his own so you may say very well maggie went on if he had none of his own he invited her may have expected her on her side to have as little and she may only since have found that out mrs assingham looked blank since and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she has found it out that she has taken the measure since their marriage she explained of how much he had asked of her more say than she had understood at the time he may have made out at last how such a demand was in the long run to affect her he may have done many things mrs assingham responded but theres one thing he certainly wont have done hell never have shown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must have understood he was to give ive often wondered maggie mused what charlotte really understood but its one of the things she has never told me then as its one of the things she has never told me either we shall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of our business there are many things said mrs assingham that we shall never know maggie took it in with a long reflection never but there are others her friend went on that stare us in the face and that under whatever difficulty you may feel you labour may now be enough for us your father has been extraordinary it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied to this with a rush extraordinary magnificent said fanny assingham her companion held tight to it magnificent then hell do for himself whatever there may be to do what he undertook for you hell do to the end he didnt undertake it to break down in what quiet patient exquisite as he is did he ever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself to have failed and he wont have done it on this occasion ah this occasion and maggies wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure he doesnt if he doesnt then so much the better leave him alone do you mean give him up leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her after this after everything arent they for that matter intimately together now intimately how do i know but fanny kept it up arent you and your husband in spite of everything maggies eyes still further if possible dilated it remains to be seen if youre not then wheres your faith in my husband mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father it all comes back to that rest on it on his ignorance fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that take it maggie stared mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which for a minute she let the princess face her do you see i see said maggie at last then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to the window as if still to keep something in her face from sight she stood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assinghams reverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to which her condition so oddly even to herself was that both of recurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it looked at it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in her hands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of it she had seldom handled so much massive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to further freedom and presently to saying i dont believe in this you know it brought maggie round to her dont believe in it you will when i tell you ah tell me nothing i wont have it said mrs assingham she kept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gave maggies attention to her she saw the next moment a quality of excited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and the impression betrayed by her companions eyes grew more distinct in a word of warning its of value but its values impaired ive learned by a crack a crack in the gold it isnt gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled thats the point what is it then its glass and cracked under the gilt as i say at that glass of this weight well said maggie its crystal and was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it she had come away from her window one of the three by which the wide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the western sky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of this indication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of the slowlyfading light here thumbing the singular piece weighing it turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious above all of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again a crack then your whole idea has a crack maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that but fanny with decision had already taken her up theres only one knowledge that concerns us one fact with which we can have anything to do which one then the fact that your husband has never never never but the very gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to her friend across the room made her for an instant hang fire well never what never been half so interested in you as now but dont you my dear really feel it maggie considered oh i think what ive told you helps me to feel it his having today given up even his forms his keeping away from me his not having come and she shook her head as against all easy glosses it is because of that you know well then if its because of this and fanny assingham who had been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly had come raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively above her head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess as a signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought and of her act she held the precious vessel and then with due note taken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard in the embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of the crash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of her effort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and this high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them for a minute more after which whatever you meant by it and i dont want to know now has ceased to exist mrs assingham said and what in the world my dear did you mean by it that sound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effect of fannys speech it broke upon the two womens absorption with a sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for the door of the room had been opened by the prince without their taking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch the conclusion of fannys act his eyes attached themselves through the large space allowing just there as happened a free view to the shining fragments at this ladys feet his question had been addressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediately afterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in a manner of which neither party had been capable doubtless for mute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place on the eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlottes reappearance something now again became possible for these communicants under the intensity of their pressure something that took up that tale and that might have been a redemption of pledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal and disguised response lasted indeed long enough for more results than one long enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat of quick selfrecovery possibly therefore of recognition still more immediate accompanying amerigos vision and estimate of the evidence with which she had been so admirably she felt as she looked at him inspired to deal she looked at him and looked at him there were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking too and was moreover looking at them both so that these things for the elder woman quickly enough reduced themselves to one she met his question not too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gathering herself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces on the ground she simply referred him to his wife she should see them later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as to what maggie had meant she said in her turn from the door why maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him xxxiv left with her husband maggie however for the time said nothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not to see his face again till he should have had a minute to arrange it she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and her next movement seen it as it showed during the stare of surprise that followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugely expert she had been made for judging it quickly by that vision of it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed a light into her troubled soul the night of his late return from matcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for however few instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one of the most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assinghams retreat just long enough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was his recognition the result of his having been forced by the flush of their visitors attitude and the unextinguished report of her words to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident of the incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had not unnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by the three fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay there on the floor and which even across the width of the room his kept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly of something known some other unforgotten image that was a mere shock that was a pain as if fannys violence had been a violence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violence calling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might have called it maggie knew as she turned away from him that she didnt want his pain what she wanted was her own simple certainty not the red mark of conviction flaming there in his beauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she would have liked that best if it were a question of saying what she now apparently should have to and of taking from him what he would say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearest approach to a boon she went in silence to where her friend never in intention visibly so much her friend as at that moment had braced herself to so amazing an energy and there under amerigos eyes she picked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in her rustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompt tribute to order only to find however that she could carry but two of the fragments at once she brought them over to the chimneypiece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cup before fannys appropriation of it and after laying them carefully down went back for what remained the solid detached foot with this she returned to the mantelshelf placing it with deliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupying herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after she had squared again her little objects on the chimney she was within an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasion was passing that they were dining out that he wasnt dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in all probability so horribly red in the face and so awry in many ways with agitation that in view of the ambassadors company of possible comments and constructions she should need before her glass some restoration of appearances amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of her having enjoined on him to wait suggested it by the positive pomp of her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till she should pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her this delay again certainly tested her presence of mind though that strain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes for the time from her husbands as she might she soon found herself much more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit there was even a minute when her back was turned to him during which she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him a strangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in the depth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of the air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft of a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the faroff round of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste of her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more she had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeing herself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in all its abomination so utterly before her that there was nothing else to add what it came to was that merely by being with him there in silence she felt within her the sudden split between conviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged no inch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil but action began to hover like some lighter and larger but easier form excited by its very power to keep above ground it would be free it would be independent it would go in wouldnt it for some prodigious and superior adventure of its own what would condemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedom this glimmered on maggie even now was the possibility richer with every lapsing moment that her husband would have on the whole question a new need of her a need which was in fact being born between them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so new that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needing her for the first one in their whole connection no he had used her had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there had been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him which she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of this particular clue moreover was that she should have now to arrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be but consistently simple and straight she asked herself with concentration while her back was still presented what would be the very ideal of that method after which the next instant it had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the application fanny assingham broke it knowing it had a crack and that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do with it thought so from her own point of view that hadnt been at all my idea but she acted before i understood i had on the contrary she explained put it here in full view exactly that you might see he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyes to the fragments on the chimneypiece and she could already distinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in his acceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits of their friends violence every added inch of reflection and delay having the advantage from this point on of counting for him double it had operated within her now to the last intensity her glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helping him to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadnt she fairly got into his labyrinth with him wasnt she indeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at its centre and core whence on that definite orientation and by an instinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it she offered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not to have been imagined in advance and that moreover required ah most truly some close looking at before it could be believed in and pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemed to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in that smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that im not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibility that since i am different there may still be something in it for you if youre capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you may have to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free but take in at any rate that there is something for you if you dont too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearer the damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood with a degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated all of which represented for her a certain traceable process and her uttered words meanwhile were different enough from those he might have inserted between the lines of her alreadyspoken its the golden bowl you know that you saw at the little antiquarios in bloomsbury so long ago when you went there with charlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me a day or two before our marriage it was shown you both but you didnt take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop on monday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up some small old thing for fathers birthday after my visit to the museum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i told you it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know ive learned since i learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle them dont be afraid if you want to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte saw together its having come apart makes an unfortunate difference for its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the same i mean that of its having given me so much of the truth about you i dont therefore so much care what becomes of it now unless perhaps you may yourself when you come to think have some good use for it in that case maggie wound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herself through this narrow pass that she had really achieved something that she was emerging a little in fine with the prospect less contracted she had done for him that is what her instinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on which he could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finally meet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of his distress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for still another minute before he committed himself there occurred between them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over which her superior lucidity presided it was not however that when he did commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what in the world has fanny assingham had to do with it she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost have smiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing up to her but it left her only to go the straighter she has had to do with it that i immediately sent for her and that she immediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i had learned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out as much as i could for myself that i also wanted to have done but it didnt in spite of everything take me very far and she has really been a help not so much as she would like to be not so much as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has done her very best for you never forget that and has kept me along immeasurably better than i should have been able to come without her she has gained me time and that these three months dont you see has been everything she had said dont you see on purpose and was to feel the next moment that it had acted these three months the prince asked counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedral which you wont have forgotten describing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning of my being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a long time had two relations with charlotte he stared a little at sea as he took it up two something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolish leaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such a consequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculous even in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of the penalty of wrongdoing oh you may have had fifty had the same relation with her fifty times its of the number of kinds of relation with her that i speak a number that doesnt matter really so long as there wasnt only one kind as father and i supposed one kind she went on was there before us we took that fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we never thought of there being another kept out of our sight but after the evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my idea which you never dreamed i had from the moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you became yourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of the difference but its within these last hours that ive most seen where we are and as ive been in communication with fanny assingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know my certainty with the determination of which however you must understand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggie remarked he had given her all his attention and with this impression for her again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to her for time time only time she could sufficiently imagine and to whatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk even at the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it was still for a minute as if he waited for something worse wanted everything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he too as was his right should know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech must have been the impulse to take up something she put before him that he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make free with it but had to keep his hands off for reasons he had already made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned at her out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever the none too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affected him as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyes might have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him the answer without his asking the question had he his idea and has he now with you anything more those were the words he had to hold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpest thrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserable pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could none the less perfectly accord to name her father on any such basis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossible thing to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this moved back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived but which had been between the two with so much so strangely much else quite uncalculated verily it towered before her this history of their confidence they had built strong and piled high based as it was on such appearances their conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she would always quite to the end and through and through take them as nobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensation of a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty to count with that practically found him as unprepared as if he had been like his wife an abjectly simple person and she meanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning for herself that whatever he might have to take from her she being on her side beautifully free he would absolutely not be able for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either as his fatherinlaws wife mrs verver rose between them there for the time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defend her explain about her was at the least to bring her into the question which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldnt open to him on all of which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warned and embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain he writhed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was not till then that he had chosen between what he could do and what he couldnt youre apparently drawing immense conclusions from very small matters wont you perhaps feel in fairness that youre striking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather too easily feel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cup there does come back to me i frankly confess now to the occasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at the time we took two or three hours together by arrangement it was on the eve of my marriage at the moment you say but that put it on the eve of yours too my dear which was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some small weddingpresent a hunt for something worth giving you and yet possible from other points of view as well in which it seemed i could be of use you were naturally not to be told precisely because it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across that crystal cup which im bound to say upon my honour i think it rather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive should have treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turned his eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of the precious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into the achieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath of comparative relief behind everything beneath everything it was somehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her and he seemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at a little shop in bloomsbury i think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to work off his bowl but i didnt believe in it and we didnt take it maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expression of candour oh you left it for me but what did you take he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then as if he might have been trying to forget nothing i think at that place what did you take then at any other what did you get me since that was your aim and end for a weddinggift the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didnt we get you anything maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyes on him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments on her chimney yes it comes round after all to your having got me the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by so wonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to have it pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you see must have believed in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as i saw it though i didnt know at all then she added what i was taking with it the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference of trying to imagine what this might have been i agree with you that the coincidence is extraordinary the sort of thing that happens mainly in novels and plays but i dont see you must let me say the importance or the connexion of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she had quickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him once more another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering its not my having gone into the place at the end of four years that makes the strangeness of the coincidence for dont such chances as that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidly said is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i had got it home which value came she explained from the wonder of my having found such a friend such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could but take it as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered you and spoke of you to me on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ah but my dear if extraordinary things come from peoples taking an interest in you my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i mean very particularly its only so i can account for my afterwards hearing from him and in fact he gave me that today she pursued he gave me it frankly as his reason today the prince inquiringly echoed but she was singularly able it had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herself to abide for her light for her clue by her own order i inspired him with sympathy there you are but the miracle is that he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use to me that was really the oddity of my chance the princess proceeded that i should have been moved in my ignorance to go precisely to him he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at the best but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only made a vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture im sorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a long time ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the mans striking me as a decided little beast she gave a slow headshake as if no after consideration not that way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for he had nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what he came to tell me that he had asked me too high a price more than the object was really worth there was a particular reason which he hadnt mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me again wrote in such terms that i saw him here this afternoon here it made the prince look about him downstairs in the little red room while he was waiting he looked at the few photographs that stand about there and recognised two of them though it was so long ago he remembered the visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gave him his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everything and told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it again he had recurred to it he told me of your having wished to make each other presents but of thats not having come off the lady was greatly taken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reason against receiving it from her and you had been right he would think that of you more than ever now maggie went on he would see how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowl could be broken i had bought it myself you see for a present he knew i was doing that this was what had worked in him especially after the price i had paid her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out in small waves of energy each of which spent its force so that he had an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed but the quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was the price she paused again a little it was high certainly for those fragments i think i feel as i look at them there rather ashamed to say the prince then again looked at them he might have been growing used to the sight but shall you at least get your money back oh im far from wanting it back i feel so that im getting its worth with which before he could reply she had a quick transition the great fact about the day were talking of seems to me to have been quite remarkably that no present was then made me if your undertaking had been for that that was not at least what came of it you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague and grave almost retrospectively concerned nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets which was made me as if it mattered a mite ever so frankly ever so beautifully and touchingly this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah of course you couldnt have minded distinctly as she went on he was getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the world together in no greater quantity than an occasion illchosen at the best for a scene might decently make room for he looked at his watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i dont make out you see what case against me you rest on everything im telling you why the whole case the case of your having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea of your finding something for me charming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together at that moment what had really to do with it said maggie was that you had to you couldnt not from the moment you were again face to face and the reason of that was that there had been so much between you before before i came between you at all her husband had been for these last moments moving about under her eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience he again stood still youve never been more sacred to me than you were at that hour unless perhaps youve become so at this one the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up its head in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration that it was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed upon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kept her direction still however under that oh the thing ive known best of all is that youve never wanted together to offend us youve wanted quite intensely not to and the precautions youve had to take for it have been for a long time one of the strongest of my impressions that i think she added is the way ive best known known he repeated after a moment known known that you were older friends and so much more intimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadnt been told me and that gave their meaning little by little to other things that were before me would they have made a difference in the matter of our marriage the prince presently asked if you had known them she took her time to think i grant you not in the matter of ours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldnt keep down the question is so much bigger than that you see how much what i know makes of it for me that was what acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into the question of the validity of the various bearings of which he couldnt on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for him that he couldnt help betraying if only as a consequence of the effect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know on his nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at a time when he should need them for dining out pompously rather responsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let that prevent her using with all economy so precious a chance for supreme clearness i didnt force this upon you you must recollect and it probably wouldnt have happened for you if you hadnt come in ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know i didnt think you were this evening and why not well she answered you have many liabilities of different sorts with which she recalled what she had said to fanny assingham and then youre so deep it produced in his features in spite of his control of them one of those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace that testified as nothing else did to his race its you cara who are deep which after an instant she had accepted from him she could so feel at last that it was true then i shall have need of it all but what would you have done he was by this time asking if i hadnt come in i dont know she had hesitated what would you oh io that isnt the question i depend upon you i go on you would have spoken tomorrow i think i would have waited and for what he asked to see what difference it would make for myself my possession at last i mean of real knowledge oh said the prince my only point now at any rate she went on is the difference as i say that it may make for you your knowing was from the moment you did come in all i had in view and she sounded it again he should have it once more your knowing that ive ceased that youve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairly made him press her for it why to be as i was not to know it was once more then after a little that he had had to stand receptive yet the singular effect of this was that there was still something of the same sort he was made to want he had another hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed then does any one else know it was as near as he could come to naming her father and she kept him at that distance any one any one i mean but fanny assingham i should have supposed you had had by this time particular means of learning i dont see she said why you ask me then after an instant and only after an instant as she saw he made out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew as little as he had known the vision loomed in this light it fairly glared for the few seconds the vision of the two others alone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them having gropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing the picture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her fathers motive and principle with her own he was deep as amerigo called it so that no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by for that matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity all marvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even than anything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her in this i know nothing but what you tell me then ive told you all i intended find out the rest find it out he waited she stood before him a moment it took that time to go on depth upon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sank within her but with the effect somehow once more that they rather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it all it was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring that he could but take as a summons for her maid it stopped everything for the present it was an intimation to him to go and dress but she had to insist find out for yourself part fifth xxxv after the little party was again constituted at fawns which had taken for completeness some ten days maggie naturally felt herself still more possessed in spirit of everything that had last happened in london there was a phrase that came back to her from old american years she was having by that idiom the time of her life she knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense of possession which was almost too violent either to recognise or to hide it was as if she had come out that was her most general consciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simply a smoky room and had thereby at least for going on the advantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow at last gathering in the fruits of patience she had either been really more patient than she had known at the time or had been so for longer the change brought about by itself as great a difference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of a telescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained in range just as her danger lay in her exposing herself to the observation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation to produce it in public was her unremitted rule but the difficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of it had doubled humbugging which she had so practised with her father had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis of mere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cues with anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted to leading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five she had made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from the moment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibility and made of the latter all a mere question of having something precious and precarious in charge there was no one to help her with it not even fanny assingham now this good friends presence having become inevitably with that climax of their last interview in portland place a severely simplified function she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it could only consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at no point whatever assuredly at least with maggie the matter they had discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as a value only for the clear negation of everything she was their general sign precisely of unimpaired beatitude and she was to live up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as she might she might privately lapse from it if she must with amerigo or with charlotte only not of course ever so much as for the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapses would be her own affair which maggie at present could take no thought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to be said to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment of her alighting at the door with the colonel everything went on between them at concert pitch what had she done that last evening in maggies room but bring the husband and wife more together than as would seem they had ever been therefore what indiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind the grand appearance of her success which would be to court a doubt of her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmony and diffused restlessly nothing but peace an extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all with the solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted tridentshaking pax britannica the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed a peace quite generally animated and peopled thanks to that fact of the presence of company in which maggies ability to preserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find its best resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highest degree every ones need quite as if every one were by the multiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation by the confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebody elses notice it had reached the point in truth that the collective bosom might have been taken to heave with the knowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a short period of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still so divided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn that some near weekend might derive from their reappearance this measured for maggie the ground they had all travelled together since that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her father in the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their old order and of their old danger she had proposed to him that they should call in charlotte call her in as a specialist might be summoned to an invalids chair wasnt it a sign of something rather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for a diversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had already had its application in truth to her invocation of the castledeans and several other members again of the historic matcham week made before she left town and made always consistently with an idea since she was never henceforth to approach these people without an idea and since that lurid element of their intercourse grew and grew for her with each occasion the flame with which it burned afresh during these particular days the way it held up the torch to anything to everything that might have occurred as the climax of revels springing from traditions so vivified this by itself justified her private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she had already produced by the aid of these people something of the effect she sought that of being good for whatever her companions were good for and of not asking either of them to give up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave an accent to the truth she wished to illustrate the truth that the surface of her recent life thicksown with the flower of earnest endeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under her pressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as it might be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigo and charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledeans set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled to assist at attestations the extent and bearing of which they rather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite of hereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a trifle scared they made none the less at fawns for number for movement for sound they played their parts during a crisis that must have hovered for them in the long passages of the old house after the fashion of the established ghost felt through the dark hours as a constant possibility rather than have menaced them in the form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders who are liable to be met in the drawingroom or to be sat next to at dinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult use for so much of the machinery of diversion she would still have had a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage now extracted from it by fanny assinghams bruised philosophy this good friends relation to it was actually the revanche she sufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham where she had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the right tone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of it to every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almost compassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantly caused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values that some of them might serve by her amused willingness to share for such of the temporarily vague among her fellowguests such of the dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it may have been partly through the effect of this especial strain of community with her old friend that maggie found herself one evening moved to take up again their dropped directness of reference they had remained downstairs together late the other women of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall these retreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed the men had apparently taken their way to the smokingroom while the princess in possession thus of a rare reach of view had lingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham was remaining a little and as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the cleared prospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive and tentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking if there were anything she could yet do and that question was answered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as she had felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggies last sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these new snatched moments where that occasion had left it he has never told her that i know of that im at last satisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes ive been in the dark since we came down not understanding what he has been doing or intending not making out what can have passed between them but within a day or two ive begun to suspect and this evening for reasons oh too many to tell you ive been sure since it explains nothing has passed between them thats what has happened it explains the princess repeated with energy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner that her auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddly enough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned back to the chimneyplace where in honour of a damp day and a chill night the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers and the evident intensity of her vision for the fact she imparted made fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained this striking fact more indeed than her companion though conscious of fairly gaping with goodwill could swallow at once the princess however as for indulgence and confidence quickly filled up the measure he hasnt let her know that i know and clearly doesnt mean to he has made up his mind hell say nothing about it therefore as shes quite unable to arrive at the knowledge by herself she has no idea how much im really in possession she believes said maggie and so far as her own conviction goes she knows that im not in possession of anything and that somehow for my own help seems to me immense immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured though not quite even as yet seeing all the way hes keeping quiet then on purpose on purpose maggies lighted eyes at least looked further than they had ever looked hell never tell her now fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired her little friend in whom this announcement was evidently animated by an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform like some small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who has suddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon her comrade so youre all right oh all rights a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i havent before where i am with it fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and you have it from him your husband himself has told you told me why what you speak of it isnt of an assurance received from him then that you do speak at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do you suppose ive asked him for an assurance ah you havent her companion smiled thats what i supposed you might mean then darling what have you asked him for ive asked him for nothing but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that evening of the embassy dinner passed between you on the contrary everything passed everything everything i told him what i knew and i told him how i knew it mrs assingham waited and that was all wasnt it quite enough oh love she bridled thats for you to have judged then i have judged said maggie i did judge i made sure he understood then i let him alone mrs assingham wondered but he didnt explain explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didnt either the decency of pride in it shed a cold little light yet as from heights at the base of which her companion rather panted but if he neither denies nor confesses he does whats a thousand times better he lets it alone he does maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i was sure he would he lets me alone fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadnt been after all though with a wonderful chance i admitted helping me too stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see that im changed for him quite changed from the idea of me that he had so long been going on with it became a question then of his really taking in the change and what i now see is that he is doing so fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you as you say alone maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her mrs assingham did what she might to embrace it checked a little however by a thought that was the nearest approach she could have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him oh thats another affair with which ive practically nothing to do i dare say however she doesnt and the princess had a more distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i dont in fact well see how she can but the point for me is that he understands yes fanny assingham cooed understands well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it big enough for you to poke in your finger a brilliant perfect surface to begin with at least i see the golden bowl as it was to have been and maggie dwelt musingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all our happiness in it the bowl without the crack for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the precious object shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasnt there still a piece missing yet if he lets you alone and you only let him maynt our doing so you mean be noticed maynt it give us away well we hope not we try not we take such care we alone know whats between us we and you and havent you precisely been struck since youve been here maggie asked with our making so good a show her friend hesitated to your father but it made her hesitate too she wouldnt speak of her father directly to everyone to her now that you understand it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotte yes if theres so much beneath it for you and if its all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together she fairly exhaled her admiration youre like nobody else youre extraordinary maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no im not extraordinary but i am for every one quiet well thats just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for an instant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that i understand you say but theres one thing i dont understand and the next minute while her companion waited she had mentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressed him not have attacked him about it how can she not have asked him asked him on his honour i mean if you know how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must well then well then you think he must have told her why exactly what i mean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of the sort will as i say have maintained the contrary fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for the truth under her direct appeal for the truth her appeal to his honour her appeal to his honour thats my point fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her from him to any one mrs assinghams face lighted hell simply hell insistently have lied maggie brought it out roundly hell simply hell insistently have lied it held again her companion who next however with a single movement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if you knew how you help me maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility was limited when one came to think by mysteries she was not to sound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuch as the princess herself as we have seen was only now in a position to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly in a consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good a friend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of which was for that matter still going on they had been duskier still however these recesses of her imagination that no doubt was what might at present be said for them she had looked into them on the eve of her leaving town almost without penetration she had made out in those hours and also of a truth during the days which immediately followed little more than the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or not the absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face very briefly the morning after the scene in her room but with the odd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on his hands he had received it from her as he might have received a bunch of keys or a list of commissions attentive to her instructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions had seemed from day to day to make so little difference for his behaviour that is for his speech or his silence to produce as yet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her on the spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all she then had to give after which on the morrow he had asked her for more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supply during the night but he had had at his command for this latter purpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an air amounting really to an appeal which if she could have brought herself to describe it vulgarly she would have described as cool just as he himself would have described it in any one else as cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on the particular ground since she didnt on the general neither his speech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weeks past yet if her sense hadnt been absolutely closed to the possibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might have taken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance of having recovered himself for one of those intentions of high impertinence by the aid of which great people les grands seigneurs persons of her husbands class and type always know how to reestablish a violated order it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sure impertinence to her at any rate was not among the arts on which he proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almost mystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehow conveyed to her that this was not because of any determination to treat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to her even though at the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserve indeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place and quite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positively proposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but the matter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixed upon her and she had found in it the more she kept it before her the tacitlyoffered sketch of a working arrangement leave me my reserve dont question it its all i have just now dont you see so that if youll make me the concession of letting me alone with it for as long a time as i require i promise you something or other grown under cover of it even though i dont yet quite make out what as a return for your patience she had turned away from him with some such unspoken words as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent to herself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen to them still again to explain her particular patience in face of his particular failure he hadnt so much as pretended to meet for an instant the question raised by her of her accepted ignorance of the point in time the period before their own marriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as an ignorance in which he and charlotte had been personally interested and to the pitch of consummately protecting for years each others interest as a condition so imposed upon her the fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself have been stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms with a chapter of history into which she could but a week before not have dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she was living she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions of view and when she asked herself at fawns to what single observation of her own in london the prince had had an affirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the small strained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancer of a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of an empty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box her best comprehension of amerigos success in not committing himself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he had made of her on their only return to the subject and which he had in fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he had had it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incident of her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman this anecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly required some straighter telling and the princes attitude in presence of it had represented once more his nearest approach to a crossexamination the difficulty in respect to the little man had been for the question of his motive his motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he had made a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see her so that his apology should be personal maggie had felt her explanation weak but there were the facts and she could give no other left alone after the transaction with the knowledge that his visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthdaygift to her father for maggie confessed freely to having chattered to him almost as to a friend the vendor of the golden bowl had acted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class and almost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadnt liked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchasers good faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in her acquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a loved parent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had known conscientious he had known superstitious visitings had given way to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it to show for what it was she had not been unconscious on the other hand that if it hadnt touched amerigo so nearly he would have found in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered an extraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on her saying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly he told me his reason was because he liked me though she remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been provoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by those that so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of her bargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumped at a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herself to the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised but rather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit not delayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to return her a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receive it and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at all events already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purpose she had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasnt a thing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldnt wish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had come to him so that he couldnt rest and he should feel better now that he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance was what he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken she might make of the bowl any use in life but that one it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all of course had occurred his pointing to the two photographs with the remark that those were persons he knew and that more wonderful still he had made acquaintance with them years before precisely over the same article the lady on that occasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to the gentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever so cleverly had declared that he wouldnt for the world receive an object under such suspicion he himself the little man had confessed wouldnt have minded about them but he had never forgotten either their talk or their faces the impression altogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that she should ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough for other buyers he had been immensely struck that was another point with this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the only light he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibility had declared that the connexion must have had mysteriously something to do with the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to her husband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done her best even while taking it full in the face not to give herself away but she wouldnt answer no she wouldnt for what she might in her agitation have made her informant think he might think what he would there had been three or four minutes during which while she asked him question upon question she had doubtless too little cared and he had spoken for his remembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors had appeared to be with each other and in fact for that conviction of the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spite of precautions they hadnt been able to help leaving him he had observed and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they were great people but no ah no distinctly hadnt liked them as he liked the signora principessa certainly she had created no vagueness about that he had been in possession of her name and address for sending her both her cup and her account but the others he had only always wondered about he had been sure they would never come back and as to the time of their visit he could place it positively to a day by reason of a transaction of importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a few hours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing that he had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her so unexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover was as much as amerigo would a matter of the personal interest with which her kindness gentleness grace her charming presence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him all of which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passion and pain as well as over the rest of the straight little story she had after all to tell might very conceivably make a long sum for the prince to puzzle out there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited to meet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches had come three or four days during which she was to learn the full extent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeed that she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fanny assingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of it while the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of a nature best known to herself and was only waiting for the better opportunity of their finding themselves less companioned this consciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggies wish to multiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcely less disguised than studied during which she turned over with anxiety the different ways there being two or three possible ones in which her young stepmother might at need seek to work upon her amerigos not having told her of his passage with his wife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlottes consciousness and condition an aspect with which for apprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequently enough for something like compassion the princess had now to reckon she asked herself for she was capable of that what he had meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about a matter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant that is for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggie could imagine what he had meant for her all sorts of thinkable things whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any such appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his fatherinlaw might notice and follow up it would have been open to him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert this danger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since an earnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of his insisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on the importance accordingly of outward peace at any price would have been the course really most conceivable instead of warning and advising he had reassured and deceived her so that our young woman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she felt the great trap of life mainly to be set for ones doing so now found herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situation of the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least the sacrifice of the least fortunate she never at present thought of what amerigo might be intending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her own ingenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface his manner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negative diplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related to mrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all this pressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide without question by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fit to prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath for the awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything it was as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from being nothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted every turn of his head every tone of his voice in these days might mean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced to abjection could hold himself during those of maggies vigils in which that view loomed largest the image of her husband that it thus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation of which she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of it to make sure of the beauty shining out of the humility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of his presence she would have gone the length of paying more yet of paying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which those actually before her might have been as superficial as headaches or rainy days the point at which these exaltations dropped however was the point at which it was apt to come over her that if her complications had been greater the question of paying would have been limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket the complications were verily great enough whether for ingenuities or sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so often that charlotte all the while could only be struggling with secrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty again and again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail the question for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunities of conference put the haunted creature off with false explanations met her particular challenges and evaded if that was what he did do her particular demands even the conviction that charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test her trouble upon her lovers wife left maggies sense meanwhile open as to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious but suspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousness helplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusion rather understood the nature of cages she walked round charlottes cautiously and in a very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicate she felt herself comparatively outside on the breast of nature and saw her companions face as that of a prisoner looking through bars so it was that through bars bars richly gilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finally struck her as making a grim attempt from which at first the princess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cage had suddenly been opened from within xxxvi they had been alone that evening alone as a party of six and four of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smokingroom they had passed together to that apartment on rising from table charlotte and mrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in fact practising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of her stealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe here cards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule the game forming itself as had often happened before of mr verver with mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license to relieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post out on the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the other end of the room and the princess herself had welcomed the comparatively hushed hour for the bridgeplayers were serious and silent much in the mood of a tired actress who has the good fortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enough for a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggies nap had she been able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spirit rather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp with the last salmoncoloured french periodical she was to fail for refreshment even of that sip of independence there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyes and getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none of those refinements of the higher criticism with which its pages bristled she was there where her companions were there again and more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they had been made in their personal intensity and their rare complexity of relation freshly importunate to her it was the first evening there had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were due the next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation were upright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her fathers wifes lover facing his mistress the fact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking between them the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fanny assingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each probably when one came to think than either of them knew of either erect above all for her was the sharpedged fact of the relation of the whole group individually and collectively to herself herself so speciously eliminated for the hour but presumably more present to the attention of each than the next card to be played yes under that imputation to her sense they sat the imputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparently straight play if she werent really watching them from her corner and consciously as might be said holding them in her hand she was asking herself at last how they could bear it for though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party they struck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity and propriety to the stiff standard of the house her father she knew was a high adept one of the greatest she had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelled easily as he understood and practised every art that could beguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of the nobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether for her or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at least achieved security represented by so complete a conquest of appearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kind of provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just as she sat there near them she had at her command with the sense that if she were but different oh ever so different all this high decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination of the monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which we so often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should go further in unexplained retreats and reactions after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare and turn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence a sentence easy to choose among several of the lurid after she had faced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rose from her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly round the room passing near the cardplayers and pausing an instant behind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vague mild face upon them as if to signify that little as she followed their doings she wished them well and she took from each across the table in the common solemnity an upward recognition which she was to carry away with her on her moving out to the terrace a few minutes later her father and her husband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meet her eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each a separate passage which was all the more wonderful since with the secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at her through it and in denial of it it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest of impressions the sense forced upon her as never yet of an appeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes that was deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on the part of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relation with herself which would spare the individual the danger the actual present strain of the relation with the others they thus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the whole complexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because she was there and there just as she was to lift it off them and take it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old of whom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged with the sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sink under his burden and die that indeed wasnt their design and their interest that she should sink under hers it wouldnt be their feeling that she should do anything but live live on somehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in their company to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped and that she was still there to simplify this idea of her simplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet but steadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it from them clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where the summer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawl she had picked up several of the long windows of the occupied rooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shafts and fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless and starless and the air heavy and still which was why in her evening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in the outer darkness from that provocation of opportunity which had assaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leaped at her throat nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she had remained there a little her companions watched by her through one of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously and gratefully safer they might have been really charming as they showed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguished they might have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was the author they might even for the happy appearance they continued to present have been such figures as would by the strong note of character in each fill any author with the certitude of success especially of their own histrionic they might in short have represented any mystery they would the point being predominantly that the key to the mystery the key that could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was there in her pocket or rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in her hand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned and saw the others still where she had left them she passed round the house and looked into the drawingroom lighted also but empty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice of all the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid like a stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignities and decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things as ugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she was trying so hard to pick up she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afresh for the look into the smokingroom and by this time it was as if the recognition had of itself arrested her she saw as in a picture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct why it was she had been able to give herself so little from the first to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as she watched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned for it for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for something she had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which for many women would have meant so much but which for her husbands wife for her fathers daughter figured nothing nearer to experience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view with crude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spears against the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with but turning off short before it reached her and plunging into other defiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almost failed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would by her thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in her cry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at its ease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thing hideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsity she had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by it had met her like some badfaced stranger surprised in one of the thickcarpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sunday afternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look at terror and disgust only to know that she must put away from her the bittersweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named to her as with hard lips named straight at her so that she must take it full in the face that other possible relation to the whole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it was extraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feel about them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generosity betrayed would have been to give them up and that giving them up was marvellously not to be thought of she had never from the first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them up so little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence of a step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception of doing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smooth stone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after a little she passed again the lights of the empty drawingroom and paused again for what she saw and felt there it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlotte was in the room launched and erect there in the middle and looking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her cardtable by one of the passages with the expectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter she had pulled up at seeing the great room empty maggie not having passed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed so definite a quest of her with the bridgeparty interrupted or altered for it was an impression that fairly assailed the princess and to which something of attitude and aspect of the air of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together with the suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added its meaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had been infinitely conscious of maggies presence before that she knew that she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bob assingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and the arrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness of the energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in a situation in which people werent supposed to be watching each other was what affected our young woman on the spot as a breaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out of the cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquely rose of whether she mightnt by some art just where she was and before she could go further be hemmed in and secured it would have been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closing the windows and giving the alarm with poor maggies sense that though she couldnt know what she wanted of her it was enough for trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be to say nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along the terrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of such evasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to this feebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presently resorted the most that could be said for her being as she felt while she finally stopped short at a distance that she could at any rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into the house by another way and safely reach her room she had literally caught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told her there vividly in a single word what she had all along been most afraid of she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte that would determine her fathers wife to take him into her confidence as she couldnt possibly as yet have done to prepare for him a statement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what she was apparently suspected of this should she have made up her mind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of which evoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would show her as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to be able to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on the defensive with maggies cause and maggies word in fine against her own it wasnt maggies that would most certainly carry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea which would be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experience and assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar to herself such a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had come into view for if so much as this was still firm ground between the elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been so consistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggie herself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not for any wrought discomposure among the triumphant three it stood merely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them she was unable at the minute of course fully to measure the difference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably an agitating image the way it might be held over her that if she didnt of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to the reference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered and unutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied her father would be invited without further ceremony to recommend her to do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmered suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer for meeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on making out the next instant what the new system would probably have to be and she had practically done that before perceiving that the thing she feared had already taken place charlotte extending her search appeared now to define herself vaguely in the distance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of the smokingroom windows had presently contributed its help her friend came slowly into that circle having also for herself by this time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was on the terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of the windows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearer and pause again still with a considerable length of the place between them yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and had stopped now to put her further attention to the test her face was fixed on her through the night she was the creature who had escaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motion assuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentous intelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention but with an intention the more definite that it could so accord with quiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval and exchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might have pierced the night and maggie was at last to start with the scared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread to hesitation for a time that with no other proof needed would have completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have felt herself absolutely take from her visitor something that the latter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificed all past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledge of an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw her come on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came on with the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after looking at it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed her head by the time she was at her companions side for that matter by the time charlotte had without a motion without a word simply let her approach and stand there her head was already on the block so that the consciousness that everything had now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe had fallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggies own sense but that of having been thrown over on her back with her neck from the first half broken and her helpless face staring up that position only could account for the positive grimace of weakness and pain produced there by charlottes dignity ive come to join you i thought you would be here oh yes im here maggie heard herself return a little flatly its too close indoors very but close even here charlotte was still and grave she had even uttered her remark about the temperature with an expressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel her not fail of her purpose the airs heavy as if with thunder i think therell be a storm she made the suggestion to carry off an awkwardness which was a part always of her companions gain but the awkwardness didnt diminish in the silence that followed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was dark as with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsome head and long straight neck testified through the dusk to their inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as if what she had come out to do had already begun and when as a consequence maggie had said helplessly dont you want something wont you have my shawl everything might have crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs ververs rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that they hadnt closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might have represented the success with which she watched all her message penetrate they presently went back the way she had come but she stopped maggie again within range of the smokingroom window and made her stand where the party at cards would be before her side by side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quiet harmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significance which as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself had hovered in sight of it a quarterofanhour before it would have been a thing for her to show charlotte to show in righteous irony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now it was she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte and she saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she must at present submissively seem to take it the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent over their game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it was to her fathers quiet face discernibly expressive of nothing that was in his daughters mind that our young womans attention was most directly given his wife and his daughter were both closely watching him and to which of them could he have been notified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it most important to destroy for his clutch at the equilibrium any germ of uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharply and so formidably known her old possession of him as a thing divided and contested she was looking at him by charlottes leave and under charlottes direction quite in fact as if the particular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in any other it came home to her too that the challenge wasnt as might be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlottes for that of her security at any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration have been naming to maggie the price naming it as a question for maggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must pay what she was to pay with being her own affair straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all put upon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant during which there burned in her a wild wish that her father would only look up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal to him she would chance it that is if he would but just raise his eyes and catch them across the larger space standing in the outer dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some sign she scarce knew what that would save her save her from being the one this way to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signal to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he asked that represented maggies one little lapse from consistency the sole small deflection in the whole course of her scheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dear mans eyes had never moved and charlottes hand promptly passed into her arm had already had very firmly drawn her on quite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception on her part too of the more ways than one in which their impression could appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of the terrace turning the corner of the house and presently came abreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawingroom still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused and it was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observed for herself the very look the place had of being vivid in its stillness of having with all its great objects as ordered and balanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some high transaction some real affair of state in presence of this opportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in her the effect of everything she had already communicated she signified with the same success that the terrace and the sullen night would bear too meagre witness to the completion of her idea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres of venice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or less contemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns their final far migration soon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which each separate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her however she had made it now amounted ive been wanting and longer than youd perhaps believe to put a question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yet quite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if you had struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one i have to take it now you see as i find it they stood in the centre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the scene of life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before was by this time sufficiently peopled these few straight words filled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absent from her consciousness either of the part she was called upon to play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging her rich train she rose there beautiful and free with her whole aspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggie had kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching it tight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in it for shelter covering herself with it for humility she looked out as from under an improvised hood the sole headgear of some poor woman at somebodys proud door she waited even like the poor woman she met her friends eyes with recognitions she couldnt suppress she might sound it as she could what question then everything in her from head to foot crowded it upon charlotte that she knew she knew too well that she was showing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of her dignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lost cause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost even that of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she werent afraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she might appear a little not ashamed that is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her it being fear all the while that moved her her challenge at any rate her wonder her terror the blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceased to signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlotte was at present sustained her next words themselves had little to add have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong you consider ive done you i feel at last that ive a right to ask you their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggies avoided at least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want to ask it my natural desire to know youve done that for so long little justice maggie waited a moment for so long you mean youve thought i mean my dear that ive seen ive seen week after week that you seemed to be thinking of something that perplexed or worried you is it anything for which im in any degree responsible maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be ah thats not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry to have to try to say im aware of no point whatever at which i may have failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may have failed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interested to care if ive been guilty of some fault ive committed it all unconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestly about it but if ive been mistaken as to what i speak of the difference more and more marked as ive thought in all your manner to me why obviously so much the better no form of correction received from you could give me greater satisfaction she spoke it struck her companion with rising with extraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besides seeing the way it was listened to helped her from point to point she saw she was right that this was the tone for her to take and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she was probably feeling that she had in advance in her delays and uncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficulty was small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued to shrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by this time effectively done it and hung it up all of which but deepened maggies sense of the sharp and simple need now of seeing her through to the end if youve been mistaken you say and the princess but barely faltered you have been mistaken charlotte looked at her splendidly hard youre perfectly sure its all my mistake all i can say is that youve received a false impression ah then so much the better from the moment i had received it i knew i must sooner or later speak of it for that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make me glad ive spoken i thank you very much it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficulty seemed to sink her companions acceptance of her denial was like a general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than they essentially had to be it positively helped her to build up her falsehood to which accordingly she contributed another block ive affected you evidently quite accidentally in some way of which ive been all unaware ive not felt at any time that youve wronged me how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such a possibility maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt to say she said after a little something more to the present point i accuse you i accuse you of nothing ah thats lucky charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost of gaiety and maggie to go on had to think with her own intensity of amerigo to think how he on his side had had to go through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he had done so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set her the example he must have had his own difficulty about it and she was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with this admirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed upon her from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory light which covered the last inch of the ground he had given her something to conform to and she hadnt unintelligently turned on him gone back on him as he would have said by not conforming they were together thus he and she close close together whereas charlotte though rising there radiantly before her was really off in some darkness of space that would steep her in solitude and harass her with care the heart of the princess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she had kept in tune with the right and something certainly something that might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossible ledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the right yes it took this extraordinary form of her humbugging as she had called it to the end it was only a question of not by a hairs breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me that your anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take it from me that ive never at any moment fancied i could suffer by you and marvellously she kept it up not only kept it up but improved on it you must take it from me that ive never thought of you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all i think that you can possibly ask charlotte held her a moment longer she needed not then to have appeared only tactless the last word its much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial well then you have it upon your honour upon my honour and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosened she had let it fall behind her but she stood there for anything more and till the weight should be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was to come she saw it in charlottes face and felt it make between them in the air a chill that completed the coldness of their conscious perjury will you kiss me on it then she couldnt say yes but she didnt say no what availed her still however was to measure in her passivity how much too far charlotte had come to retreat but there was something different also something for which while her cheek received the prodigious kiss she had her opportunity the sight of the others who having risen from their cards to join the absent members of their party had reached the open door at the end of the room and stopped short evidently in presence of the demonstration that awaited them her husband and her father were in front and charlottes embrace of her which wasnt to be distinguished for them either she felt from her embrace of charlotte took on with their arrival a high publicity xxxvii her father had asked her three days later in an interval of calm how she was affected in the light of their reappearance and of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty and by the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of this inquiry had been for the pair just such another stroll together away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previous visit of these anciently more agitating friends that of their long talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the then purblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggie had formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning of their present situation the whirligig of time had thus brought round for them again on their finding themselves face to face while the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the same odd impulse quietly to slope so adam verver himself as they went familiarly expressed it that had acted in its way of old acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpness of their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny to them now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutches and with symptoms too at that time less developed had once for their anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it might have been funny that these ladies could ever have figured to their imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough to precipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainment and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from their actual impressions they had been finding it for months past by maggies view a resource and a relief to talk with an approach to intensity when they met of all the people they werent really thinking of and didnt really care about the people with whom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closed in at present round the spectres of their past as they permitted themselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitation of enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans the castledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggies view to teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so from providence from detroit was an old and ample one of which the most could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could be guarded sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been their wellnigh confessed desire just to rest together a little as from some strain long felt but never named to rest as who should say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair of eyes so yearningly and indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the other pair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity of their being once more perhaps only for halfanhour simply daughter and father had glimmered out for them and they had picked up the pretext that would make it easiest they were husband and wife oh so immensely as regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench conscious that the party on the terrace augmented as in the past by neighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfully like their having got together into some boat and paddled off from the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father and daughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for their situation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for that matter this came to maggie couldnt they always live so far as they lived together in a boat she felt in her face with the question the breath of a possibility that soothed her they needed only know each other henceforth in the unmarried relation that other sweet evening in the same place he had been as unmarried as possible which had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that other sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward refreshment they had after all whatever happened always and ever each other each other that was the hidden treasure and the saving truth to do exactly what they would with a provision full of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks to it they wouldnt have done before the end they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six oclock of a july afternoon hung about the massed kentish woods several features of the social evolution of her old playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainable ideals still falling back beyond the sea to their native seats for renewals of the moral financial conversational one scarce knew what to call it outfit and again and for ever reappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple had finally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggie was to take up after a drop a different matter or one at least with which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just now when i wondered what other people could wish to struggle for did you think me she asked with some earnestness well fatuous fatuous he seemed at a loss i mean sublime in our happiness as if looking down from a height or rather sublime in our general position thats what i mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious conscience something that disposed her frequently to assure herself for her human commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i dont at all want she explained to be blinded or made sniffy by any sense of a social situation her father listened to this declaration as if the precautions of her general mercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprises for him to say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty he might have been wishing to see how far she could go and where she would all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a little as if made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much on what she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as if to disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the time that came back to them from their other talk when they had shared together this same refuge dont you remember she went on how when they were here before i broke it to you that i wasnt so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation yes after fanny assingham had first broken it to me that at the rate we were going we should never have one which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had it over quite often enough for him easily to remember maggie had another pause taking it from him that he now could both affirm and admit without wincing that they had been at their critical moment put on charlotte it was as if this recognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental to the honest view of their success well she continued i recall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we had already then been more placed or whatever you may call what we are now it still wouldnt have been an excuse for wondering why others couldnt obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were the feelings we used to have oh yes he responded philosophically i remember the feelings we used to have maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tender retrospect as if they had been also respectable it was bad enough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you had a position but it was worse to be sublime about it as i was so afraid as im in fact still afraid of being when it wasnt even there to support one and she put forth again the earnestness she might have been taking herself as having outlived became for it which was doubtless too often even now her danger almost sententious one must always whether or no have some imagination of the states of others of what they may feel deprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldnt imagine we were deprived of anything and now and now but she stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud no were not proud she answered after a moment im not sure that were quite proud enough yet she changed the next instant that subject too she could only do so however by harking back as if it had been a fascination she might have been wishing under this renewed this still more suggestive visitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream of time and dipping again for the softness of the water into the contracted basin of the past we talked about it we talked about it you dont remember so well as i you too didnt know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thought we had a position and were surprised when i thought we ought to have told them we werent doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued were not doing it now were not you see really introducing them i mean not to the people they want then what do you call the people with whom theyre now having tea it made her quite spring round thats just what you asked me the other time one of the days there was somebody and i told you i didnt call anybody anything i remember that such people the people we made so welcome didnt count that fanny assingham knew they didnt she had awakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there as before he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shaking his foot yes they were only good enough the people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it all happened that was the way that was the way and you asked me maggie added if i didnt think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up to then under false pretences precisely but you said she wouldnt have understood to which you replied that in that case you were like her you didnt understand no no but i remember how about our having in our benighted innocence no position you quite crushed me with your explanation well then said maggie with every appearance of delight ill crush you again i told you that you by yourself had one there was no doubt of that you were different from me you had the same one you always had and then i asked you her father concurred why in that case you hadnt the same then indeed you did he had brought her face round to him before and this held it covering him with its kindled brightness the result of the attested truth of their being able thus in talk to live again together what i replied was that i had lost my position by my marriage that one i know how i saw it would never come back i had done something to it i didnt quite know what given it away somehow and yet not as then appeared really got my return i had been assured always by dear fanny that i could get it only i must wake up so i was trying you see to wake up trying very hard yes and to a certain extent you succeeded as also in waking me but you made much he said of your difficulty to which he added its the only case i remember mag of you ever making anything of a difficulty she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as i was that you were so happy as you were well you admitted maggie kept it up that that was a good difficulty you confessed that our life did seem to be beautiful he thought a moment yes i may very well have confessed it for so it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim his easier smile what do you want to put on me now only that we used to wonder that we were wondering then if our life wasnt perhaps a little selfish this also for a time much at his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fanny assingham thought so oh no she never thought she couldnt think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimes fools maggie developed she doesnt seem to think so much about their being wrong wrong that is in the sense of being wicked she doesnt the princess further adventured quite so much mind their being wicked i see i see and yet it might have been for his daughter that he didnt so very vividly see then she only thought us fools oh no i dont say that im speaking of our being selfish and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones oh i dont say she condones a scruple in maggie raised its crest besides im speaking of what was her father showed however after a little that he had not been reached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for the moment where they had settled look here mag he said reflectively i aint selfish ill be blowed if im selfish well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in moments of deepest sincerity could thus come back ill believe it he presently added when amerigo complains of you ah its just he whos my selfishness im selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that hes my motive in everything well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasnt a girl a right to be selfish about her husband what i dont mean she observed without answering is that im jealous of him but thats his merit its not mine her father again seemed amused at her you could be otherwise oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isnt luckily for me otherwise if everything were different she further presented her thought of course everything would be and then again as if that were but half my idea is this that when you only love a little youre naturally not jealous or are only jealous also a little so that it doesnt matter but when you love in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the same proportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal and unutterable way of all why then youre beyond everything and nothing can pull you down mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines to oppose and thats the way you love for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered it wasnt to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with a turn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of a creature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradled upon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly or sinking otherwise than in play was impossible something of all this might have been making once more present to him with his discreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of a rapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no great number of persons either of his giving or of his receiving he sat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished and not for the first time yet it was an effect that might have brought before him rather what she had gained than what he had missed besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadnt or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where though his personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too a sensation that couldnt be fixed upon him as missing since if it wasnt personally floating if it wasnt even sitting in the sand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in a communicated irresistible way for tasting the balm it could pass further for knowing for knowing that without him nothing might have been which would have been missing least of all i guess ive never been jealous he finally remarked and it said more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he was intending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring give him a look that seemed to tell of things she couldnt speak but she at last tried for one of them oh its you father who are what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down he returned the look as with the sociability of their easy communion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade of solemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better kept back so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make a pair were all right oh were all right a declaration launched not only with all her discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising with decision and standing there as if the object of their small excursion required accordingly no further pursuit at this juncture however with the act of their crossing the bar to get as might be into port there occurred the only approach to a betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind her father kept his place and it was as if she had got over first and were pausing for her consort to follow if they were all right they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and wait for some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and it was only after she had contented herself with simply smiling at him smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remaining importance of it from the bench where he leaned back raising his face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and his hands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten against the wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against the wind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhaps just vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was that she appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairly alongside of her when at the end of another minute he found their word the only thing is that as for ever putting up again with your pretending that youre selfish at this she helped him out with it you wont take it from me i wont take it from you well of course you wont for thats your way it doesnt matter and it only proves but it doesnt matter either what it proves im at this very moment she declared frozen stiff with selfishness he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely as if by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptance of the unsaid or at least their reference to it practically given up pretending it was as if they were in for it for something they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread of which was itself in a manner a seduction just as any confession of the dread was by so much an allusion then she seemed to see him let himself go when a persons of the nature you speak of there are always other persons to suffer but youve just been describing to me what youd take if you had once a good chance from your husband oh im not talking about my husband then whom are you talking about both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anything previously exchanged and they were followed on maggies part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while her companion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he werent expecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy as paying for his daughters bliss she produced something that she felt to be much better im talking about you do you mean ive been your victim of course youve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasnt been for me many things more than i can tell you things youve only to think of for yourself what do you make of all that ive done for myself yourself she brightened out with derision what do you make of what ive done for american city it took her but a moment to say im not talking of you as a public character im talking of you on your personal side well american city if personalities can do it has given me a pretty personal side what do you make he went on of what ive done for my reputation your reputation there youve given it up to them the awful people for less than nothing youve given it up to them to tear to pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with ah my dear i dont care for their horrible vulgar jokes adam verver almost artlessly urged then there exactly you are she triumphed everything that touches you everything that surrounds you goes on by your splendid indifference and your incredible permission at your expense just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets and stood there before her of course my dear you go on at my expense it has never been my idea he smiled that you should work for your living i wouldnt have liked to see it with which for a little again they remained face to face say therefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they made me a victim because i sacrifice you but to what in the world at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yet her opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in a vise her impression of his now with his strained smile which touched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutual vigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that their thin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shook between them this transparency with their very breath it was an exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give way the next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she held her breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart of which he couldnt blind that he was by his intention making sure sure whether or no her certainty was like his the intensity of his dependence on it at that moment this itself was what absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up before him on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of his observation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their different ways equally trying to save and they were saving it yes they were or at least she was that was still the workable issue she could say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now where she stood so much was crowded into so short a space that she knew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by the warning of his eyes she shouldnt lose it again she knew how and why and if she had turned cold this was precisely what helped her he had said to himself shell break down and name amerigo shell say its to him shes sacrificing me and its by what that will give me with so many other things too that my suspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying for the symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only to fail and he would have got nothing that she didnt measure out to him as she gave it she had presently in fact so recovered herself that she seemed to know she could more easily have made him name his wife than he have made her name her husband it was there before her that if she should so much as force him just not consciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would have given himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they were both doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to he was practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as a sacrifice he had read his way so into her best possibility and where had she already for weeks and days past planted her feet if not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder and colder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personal vision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was her very certitude the intensity of his pressure for if something dreadful hadnt happened there wouldnt for either of them be these dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well the immense advantage that she could have named charlotte without exposing herself as for that matter she was the next minute showing him why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one i take the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural he threw back his head a little settling with one hand his eyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences your life as your marriage has made it well hasnt it made it exactly what we wanted she just hesitated then felt herself steady oh beyond what she had dreamed exactly what i wanted yes his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowing she was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then of what i wanted i dont make anything any more than of what youve got thats exactly the point i dont put myself out to do so i never have i take from you all i can get all youve provided for me and i leave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you are the rest is your own affair i dont even pretend to concern myself to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face with what may have really become of you its as if we had agreed from the first not to go into that such an arrangement being of course charming for me you cant say you know that i havent stuck to it he didnt say so then even with the opportunity given him of her stopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh my dear oh oh but it made no difference know as she might what a past still so recent and yet so distant it alluded to she repeated her denial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth of her contention i never went into anything and you see i dont ive continued to adore you but whats that from a decent daughter to such a father what but a question of convenient arrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and my making it easy for you to see the child you dont claim i suppose that my natural course once you had set up for yourself would have been to ship you back to american city these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meet them with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enough show him what to do with them do you know mag what you make me wish when you talk that way and he waited again while she further got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and just feeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make me wish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on as you do but he really had to hold himself to say it well when i go on why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make me quite feel as if american city would be the best place for us it made her all too finely vibrate for us for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship it would serve you quite right with which he smiled oh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of which for an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in the midst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked by contrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision saw her removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made him which was all she had needed more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fire and the writing had come out still larger than she hoped the recognition of it took her some seconds but she might when she spoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoring them to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then the cause of what you do i havent the least doubt of your being up to that if you should think i might get anything out of it even the little pleasure she laughed of having said as you call it more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitable sound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air as of confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging the particular question dont you think then i can take care of myself ah its exactly what ive gone upon if it wasnt for that but she broke off and they remained only another moment face to face ill let you know my dear the day i feel youve begun to sacrifice me begun she extravagantly echoed well it will be for me the day youve ceased to believe in me with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in his pockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemed to plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it had occurred to him he might as well treat her to in default of other things before they changed their subject it had the effect for her of a reminder a reminder of all he was of all he had done of all above and beyond his being her perfect little father she might take him as representing take him as having quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres been capable of and as therefore wishing not was it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector and infallible high authority he had been and still was these things struck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderful way a character she must take into account in dealing with him either for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw him during these moments in a light of recognition which had had its brightness for her at many an hour of the past but which had never been so intense and so almost admonitory his very quietness was part of it now as always part of everything of his success his originality his modesty his exquisite public perversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and this quality perhaps it might be all the more too as the result for the present occasion of an admirable traceable effort that placed him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably had ever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of the typical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named and dated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polished and consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number of the different ways in which he thus affected her as showing he was strong that was the great thing he was sure sure for himself always whatever his idea the expression of that in him had somehow never appeared more identical with his proved taste for the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everything was that he was always marvellously young which couldnt but crown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness that he was simply a great and deep and high little man and that to love him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as a sudden an immense relief the sense that he wasnt a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence and after another instant she knew even still better why wasnt it because now also on his side he was thinking of her as his daughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the child of his blood oh then if she wasnt with her little conscious passion the child of any weakness what was she but strong enough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasnt in that case a failure either hadnt been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride was his and they were decent and competent together this was all in the answer she finally made him i believe in you more than any one than any one at all she hesitated for all it might mean but there was oh a thousand times no doubt of it than any one at all she kept nothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have the whole of it after which she went on and thats the way i think you believe in me he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the way yes well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would never return to it well then his hands came out and while her own took them he drew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kept her long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy no revulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears xxxviii maggie was to feel after this passage how they had both been helped through it by the influence of that accident of her having been caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of her fathers wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincide exactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by her husband nor by the assinghams who their cardparty suspended had quitted the billiardroom with him she had been conscious enough at the time of what such an impression received by the others might in that extended state do for her case and none the less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first to make a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the special shade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence the effect she might have considered had been almost awkward the promptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had been discovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware of spectators the spectators on the other hand that was the appearance mightnt have supposed them in the existing relation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitating with a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have felt that almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept from sounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives like a pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed to do especially when approved fools after a broil but taking note of the reconciliation would imply on her fathers part on amerigos and on fanny assinghams some proportionate vision of the grounds of their difference there had been something there had been but too much in the incident for each observer yet there was nothing any one could have said without seeming essentially to say see see the dear things their quarrels blissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear things themselves would necessarily in that case have demanded and the wits of the others would thus have been called upon for some agility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight of producing offhand a fictive reason for any estrangement to take that is the place of the true which had so long for the finer sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediately after to have remarked nothing that any one else hadnt maggies own measure had remained all the same full of the reflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one present and oh charlotte not least to draw a long breath the message of the little scene had been different for each but it had been this markedly all round that it reinforced reinforced even immensely the general effort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly more successful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life were the matter supremely however while this glass was held up to her had maggies sense turned to the quality of the success constituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she was guessing how her father must have secretly started how her husband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham must have secretly in a flash seen daylight for herself most of all had she tasted by communication of the high profit involved for her companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her own abasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared but to desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes in question had found herself repeatedly doing so to the degree that the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as a thing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her that had for instance animated the four with just the right restlessness too had decreed and directed and exactly timed it in them making their game of bridge however abysmal a face it had worn for her give way precisely to their common unavowed impulse to find out to emulate charlottes impatience a preoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member of the party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all their simulated blindness not roaming unnoted if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in a certain direction by the last felicity into which that night had flowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating the truth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolute permanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise to the occasion and be magnificent seen her decide that the right way for this would be to prove that the reassurance she had extorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon a twinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon the troubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched their whole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limit of discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay in proportion a service she acknowledged as handsome why handsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she had been veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge it would in that case have come up vividly and for each of them alike that the truth on the princesss lips presented no difficulty if the latters mood in fact could have turned itself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resist the diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlottes theory of a generous manner was manifestly to express that her stepdaughters word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relation without a cloud it had been in short in this light ideally conclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to could ever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but in itself a trifle compromising as truly within the week maggie had occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and rather abruptly to remember convinced as she was of the example already given her by her husband and in relation to which her profession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformity exquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hidden play of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princesss fancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when it plunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with images again and again with fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinations that lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into the definite and faded into the vague their main present sign for her being however that they were always that they were duskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss made insecure by the very intensity of the bliss this had dropped from her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair of operatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment a green glade as romantic as ones dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness of trouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the procession of forms that had lost all so pitifully their precious confidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day to day of unembarrassed references as she had foreseen for that matter from the first that there would be her active conception of his accessibility to their companions own private and unextinguished right to break ground was not much less active than before so it was that her inner sense in spite of everything represented him as still pulling wires and controlling currents or rather indeed as muffling the whole possibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplice continually on to some new turn of the road as regards herself maggie had become more conscious from week to week of his ingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of frankness a privation that had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirst with which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of the lost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible the impossible plash of water it was just this hampered state in him none the less that she kept before her when she wished most to find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion which nothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were others when clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell of her heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she had gathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly beside her but in fact given over without a break to the grey medium in which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which was a perpetual pang and which might last what it would for ever if need be but which if relieved at all must be relieved by his act alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had done the utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear for this aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending on him for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus more sharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warned her on hearing from her of the precious assurance received from his wife that she must take care her satisfaction didnt betray something of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting after allowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied for him of waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slowshining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightnt poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated she was thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggies own head was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to our young woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him the chill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities of deeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard her ask irritated and sombre what tone in gods name since her bravery didnt suit him she was then to adopt and by way of a fantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in a voice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came home to her that one must really manage such prudences a little for ones self it was positive in the princess that for this she breathed charlottes cold air turned away from him in it with her turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then she should rest marvellous the manner in which under such imaginations maggie thus circled and lingered quite as if she were materially following her unseen counting every step she helplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to a pause a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in that apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumph of triumph magnanimous and serene with which the upshot of the nightscene on the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms she had had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of the door of the cage forced open from within and the creature imprisoned roaming at large a movement on the creatures part that was to have even for the short interval its impressive beauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction had loomed straight into view during her last talk under the great trees with her father it was when she saw his wifes face ruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of their session he had so significantly addressed his own it was then that maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then she seemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in she shadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered it found itself arrested for certain passages during which she absolutely looked with charlottes grave eyes what she unfailingly made out through them was the figure of a little quiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across the field of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a blue necktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in his pockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhat meditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of the park and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was for all the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother in the great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasy outlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a new anxiety things these that she carried about with her done up in the napkin of her lovers accepted rebuke while she vainly hunted for some corner where she might put them safely down the disguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search might have been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggies provision of irony which we have taken for naturally small had never been so scant as now and there were moments while she watched with her thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was to feel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved to saying to her hold on tight my poor dear without too much terror and it will all come out somehow even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might have replied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaning could attach so long as the little meditative man in the straw hat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weaving his spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarter of the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticed as absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware of two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him the hint that he measured the impression he produced it was not really till after their recent long talk in the park that she knew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had then communicated so that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociable drinkers who sit back from the table over which they have been resting their elbows over which they have emptied to the last drop their respective charged cups the cups were still there on the table but turned upside down and nothing was left for the companions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that the wine had been good they had parted positively as if on either side primed with it primed for whatever was to be and everything between them as the month waned added its touch of truth to this similitude nothing truly was at present between them save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during the deep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed at morning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contact that they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of the upper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other to sit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionally ranged she sometimes only looked at him from end to end of the great gallery the pride of the house for instance as if in one of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekers were unknown he had ever of course had his way of walking about to review his possessions and verify their condition but this was a pastime to which he now struck her as almost extravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and he turned to give her a smile she caught or so she fancied the greater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation it was as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he went and it was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficiently within earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reason connected with the very manner of it stood off and didnt dare one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriage most freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautiful objects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he could teach her about them maggie had in due course seen her begin to work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all it was worth she took possession of the mound throughout its extent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked in the assumption of its being for her with her husband all the ground the finest clearest air and most breathable medium common to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if she didnt in these intensities of approbation too much shut him up to his province but this was a complaint he had never made his daughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perception marching with his own and never falling behind she had probably not so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or a revealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all of being a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her as at these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigo called them under the coved ceilings of fawns while so together yet at the same time so separate they were making their daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasised attention she stopped when her husband stopped but at the distance of a case or two or of whatever other succession of objects and the likeness of their connection would not have been wrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one of his pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped round her beautiful neck he didnt twitch it yet it was there he didnt drag her but she came and those indications that i have described the princess as finding extraordinary in him were two or three mute facial intimations which his wifes presence didnt prevent his addressing his daughter nor prevent his daughter as she passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a little at the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted silken rope and maggies translation of it held in her breast till she got well away came out only as if it might have been overheard when some door was closed behind her yes you see i lead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesnt so much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heart which if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i as a husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump she thinks it may be her doom the awful place over there awful for her but shes afraid to ask dont you see just as shes afraid of not asking just as shes afraid of so many other things that she sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals shell know however when she does know charlottes one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidence she had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firm and charming type was the presence of visitors never as the season advanced wholly intermitted rather in fact so constant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and for tea and to see the house now replete now famous that maggie grew to think again of this large element of company as of a kind of renewed watersupply for the tank in which like a party of panting goldfish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so many of the silences of which their intimate intercourse would otherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventions their effect above all in bringing home to each the possible heroism of perfunctory things they learned fairly to live in the perfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day as might be it took on finally the likeness of some spacious central chamber in a haunted house a great overarched and overglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors of which opened into sinister circular passages here they turned up for each other as they said with the blank faces that denied any uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerous doors carefully behind them all save the door that connected the place as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated the aperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus are poured into the ring the great part mrs verver had socially played came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friends charlottes personal friends had ever been in london at the two houses one of the most convenient pleasantries who actually tempered at this crisis her aspect of isolation and it wouldnt have been hard to guess that her best moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becoming a bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiosity might be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and she marched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted each day on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in the gallery at the oddest hours with the party she was entertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon the interest snub even the particular presumption and smile for the general bewilderment inevitable features these latter of almost any occasion in a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by which a creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly right could be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguely circulating was attended by his wife it was always charlotte who seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the background when she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that moving mildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiated conscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to him in vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more than if he had been the person employed to see that after the invading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and the symmetries all restored there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon and shortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles off whom mrs verver had taken in charge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery through which she had been about to pass faltered there for the very impression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte halfway down the vista held together as if by something almost austere in the grace of her authority the semiscared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to this consistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reached her husband and her stepdaughter while she thus placed beyond doubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed to the largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablaze with tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotion fanny assingham who forsook this other friend as little as she forsook either her host or the princess or the prince or the principino she supported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations of presence at all such times and maggie advancing after a first hesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutable attitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escape being provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latters level long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a mute appeal you understand dont you that if she didnt do this there would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistingly moved became uncertain again and then not too much to show it or rather positively to conceal it and to conceal something more as well turned short round to one of the windows and awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the three pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped round it which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe are not of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a later time by a process of which there are very few examples and none so important as this which is really quite unique so that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as a specimen is i believe almost inestimable so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over the heads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggie meanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to be happening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least on the point of it the lighted square before her all blurred and dim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless for conscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds during which it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soul in pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapse so that maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start to her father cant she be stopped hasnt she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose in her then it was that across half the gallery for he had not moved from where she had first seen him he struck her as confessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identity of emotion poor thing poor thing it reached straight isnt she for ones credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute the shame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest the divined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on air so much for deep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of there was honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closed to her aftersense of such passages we have already indeed in other cases seen it open that the deepest depth of all in a perceived penalty was that you couldnt be sure some of your compunctions and contortions wouldnt show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he at this juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted as being he had gone to london for the day and the night a necessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had more than once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest in whom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to his wife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a high dim august dawn when she couldnt sleep and when creeping restlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness of wooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march with the perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosily coloured her vision that even such as he was yes her husband could on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldnt otherwise have given as his reason for going up to portland place in the august days that he was arranging books there he had bought a great many of late and he had had others a large number sent from rome wonders of old print in which her father had been interested but when her imagination tracked him to the dusty town to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where a caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasnt to see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes she saw him in truth less easily beguiled saw him wander in the closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for long periods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through the smoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking better than anything in the world just now to be alone with his thoughts being herself connected with his thoughts she continued to believe more than she had ever been it was thereby a good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out as resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to which he was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impression of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was like his doing penance in sordid ways being sent to prison or being kept without money it wouldnt have taken much to make her think of him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a right thought wonderful maggie now to so many more freedoms than he took his secret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced was all the while in presences in respect to which he had thrown himself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries of pride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had that morning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinary measure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch at pretexts for absence it all came to her there he got off to escape from a sound the sound was in her own ears still that of charlottes high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushed gallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the day before as by that of a creature in anguish and by which while she sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had been forced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that the wonder for her became really his not feeling the need of wider intervals and thicker walls before that admiration she also meditated consider as she might now she kept reading not less into what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty of intention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure it was like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to be made of the confusion of growing things but one felt they were folded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole air their medium he had to turn away but he wasnt at least a coward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he had done on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledge of her windowseat where she blinded her eyes from the full glare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatever might come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat its inevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out his pale hard grimace xxxix the resemblance had not been present to her on first coming out into the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoon only the second sunday of all the summer when the party of six the party of seven including the principino had practically been without accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldnt be affected quite as she herself had been that night on the terrace under mrs ververs perceptive pursuit the relation today had turned itself round charlotte was seeing her come through patches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlotte menace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across the distance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not less soundless and to all appearance not less charged with strange meanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the house at so unlikely an hour three oclock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden or grove and had thereupon felt her impulse determined with the same sharpness that had made the spring of her companions three weeks before it was the hottest day of the season and the shaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainly rather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps not yet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements of repose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the great bedimmed diningroom the cool ceremonious semblance of luncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she had been represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reported to the rest of the company by her husband but offered directly to mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced to the slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to marked reserves of reference in many directions poor fanny assingham herself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow into which she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which might almost have been taken for a community of dread ruled the scene relieved only by the fitful experiments of father mitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked london friend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the light neighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggies munificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bounties of the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of the entertainers and the princesss power to feel him on the whole a blessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkward in her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself at times if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely she had dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of all he must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessed nothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanely filling up gaps at present for the very reason that his instinct sharper than the expression of his face had sufficiently served him made him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension round about him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akin to virtue some day in some happier season she would confess to him that she hadnt confessed though taking so much on her conscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffened hand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded a vow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of a better wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly help itself and in addition however that might be she drew breath this afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still when she wondered above all if the cord mightnt at last have snapped between her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismay at the possibility of such a passage there moved before them the procession of ugly forms it might have taken find out for yourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on the question of who else knew that night of the breaking of the bowl and she flattered herself that she hadnt since then helped him in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she had given him all these weeks to be busy with and she had again and again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of his uncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldnt even try to become indifferent and that yet wouldnt project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he was generous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once she had said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon him and that the polished old ivory of her fathers inattackable surface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistake or some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of one of his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally he would have put himself in the wrong blighting by a single false step the perfection of his outward show these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchell prattled with other shadows as well those that hung over charlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equal suspicions to the idea in particular of a change such a change as she didnt dare to face in the relations of the two men or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed to maggie there were always too many and all of them things of evil when ones nerves had at last done for one all that nerves could do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was like the predicament of the nightwatcher in a beasthaunted land who has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost of poor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnly appreciating her fathers wine anything verily yes of the good priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands and twiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hard at the decanters at the different dishes of dessert he eyed them halfobliquely as if they might have met him today for conversation better than any one present but the princess had her fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of a passage before she knew it between father mitchell and charlotte some approach he would have attempted with her that very morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparent detachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inference taken it for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was not through neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribed contrition he had at any rate quickened in her the beat of that false repose to which our young womans own act had devoted her at her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid traps compared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted might have seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely would have left her nothing to do she could have remained had she liked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceed against her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had to confirm day after day the rightness of her cause and the justice and felicity of her exemption so that wouldnt there have been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchells depths of practical derision of her success the question was provisionally answered at all events by the time the party at luncheon had begun to disperse with maggies version of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing her pretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she met the good priests eyes before they separated and priests were really at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that she believed him for an instant on the verge of saying to her in abysmal softness go to mrs verver my child you go youll find that you can help her this didnt come however nothing came but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomach and the full flush the comical candour of reference to the hand employed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but the receding backs of each of the others her fathers slightly bent shoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by the force of habit not less patiently than if his wife had been present her husband indeed was present to feel anything there might be to feel which was perhaps exactly why this personage was moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupations books to arrange perhaps even at fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all the conditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in the event left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who after waiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make a demonstration the stage of talking over had long passed for them when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of an attention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of the spectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with the overworked little trapezist girl the acrobatic support presumably of embarrassed and exacting parents and gives her as an obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolent interest what was clearest always in our young womans imaginings was the sense of being herself left for any occasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear the burden in the last resort of surrounding omissions and evasions and it was eminently to that office she had been today abandoned with this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assinghams keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested that she too was still on the ramparts though her gallantry proved indeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot dont you really want us to go maggie found a faint smile do you really want to it made her friend colour well then no but we would you know at a look from you wed pack up and be off as a sacrifice ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through thats it thats all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on youre too splendid splendid splendid also you know you are all but through youve done it said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her what does it strike you that ive done what you wanted theyre going maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted oh it wasnt for you to say that was his business my fathers maggie asked after an hesitation your fathers he has chosen and now she knows she sees it all before her and she cant speak or resist or move a little finger thats whats the matter with her said fanny assingham it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stood there the picture that the words of others whatever they might be always made for her even when her vision was already charged better than any words of her own she saw round about her through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare of nature saw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yet denied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her off somewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in her fate has she told you she then asked her companion smiled superior i dont need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then as maggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i see the long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country state after state which have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but never simply i see the extraordinary interesting place which ive never been to you know and you have and the exact degree in which she will be expected to be interested she will be maggie presently replied expected interested for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end of which fanny said shell be yes what shell have to be and it will be wont it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding in her friends sense but it made maggie still only look at her these were large words and large visions all the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i dont mean it as you would have a right to do you know because you see and i dont see him i dont make him out she almost crudely confessed maggie again hesitated you mean you dont make out amerigo but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal to ones intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite of everything long been superseded then maggie measured the reach of her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning a richness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham had taken that without delay from her eyes with a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i know nothing you know how you feel but again she denied it i know nothing if i did well if you did fanny asked as she faltered she had had enough however i should die she said as she turned away she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there a moment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then took her way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour the principino would be enjoying his nap she passed through the first empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boys ample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirsapparent and a gift early in his career from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre in the stillness of which she could almost hear the childs soft breathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed beside him her father sat there with as little motion with head thrown back and supported with eyes apparently closed with the fine foot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon the other knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constant flawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could always receive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noble had majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporary abdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggie lingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of which was pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her father really slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was she to take this his forebearance from any question only as a sign again that everything was left to her she at all events for a minute watched his immobility then as if once more renewing her total submission returned without a sound to her own quarters a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept as she could have slept that morning days before when she had watched the first dawn from her window turned to the east this side of her room was now in shade with the two wings of the casement folded back and the charm she always found in her seemingly perched position as if her outlook from above the high terraces was that of some castletower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and the woods all of which drowsed below her at this hour in the immensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks of flowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let their tails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliant void if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had not caught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the act of descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally so as to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie had quickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion of this adventurer had taken in that charlotte of all people had chosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens and that she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarter deep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as a superior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes in sight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayal of her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and then understood for herself why the act of sitting still had become impossible to either of them there came to her confusedly some echo of an ancient fable some vision of io goaded by the gadfly or of ariadne roaming the lone seastrand it brought with it all the sense of her own intention and desire she too might have been for the hour some faroff harassed heroine only with a part to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the while all the while of her sitting there among the others without her she had wanted to go straight to this detached member of the party and make somehow for her support the last demonstration a pretext was all that was needful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of her carrying a book made out half lost in the folds of her white dress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purpose in case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggies table the book was an old novel that the princess had a couple of days before mentioned having brought down from portland place in the charming original form of its three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitter of interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs ververs apartments she was afterwards to observe that this messenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one of the volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in an arbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared on the spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with a parasol was all she required in addition that is to the bravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tables on her friend which we have already noted but so far as she went after descending into the open and beginning to explore the grounds mrs verver had gone still further with the increase of the oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection of her room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit one didnt arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length densely overarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle and converging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageous temple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched and roofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that of everything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence from the present and no menace from the future charlotte had paused there in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the place was a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her from the seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly as maggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on the terrace the distance was too great to assure her she had been immediately seen but the princess waited with her intention as charlotte on the other occasion had waited allowing oh allowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full of the sense of that so full that it made her impatient whereupon she moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyes that had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenly called to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed of being followed and instinctively with her pale stare she stiffened herself for protest maggie could make that out as well as further however that her second impression of her friends approach had an instant effect on her attitude the princess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly paused again to give her time for whatever she would whatever she would whatever she could was what maggie wanted wanting above all to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that was not what charlotte had wanted the other night but this never mattered the great thing was to allow her was fairly to produce in her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she had been frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struck her without some design on the part of her pursuer and what might she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in her spirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time that hard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it and heard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressure successfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companions still countenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serve as the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface to be thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that during one of these minutes the princess had the vision of her particular alarm its her lie its her lie that has mortally disagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion at it and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounce it to give me full in my face the truth instead this for a concentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gasp but only to let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state she herself could but tentatively hover place in view the book she carried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild as possible remind herself really of people she had read about in stories of the wild west people who threw up their hands on certain occasions as a sign they werent carrying revolvers she could almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knew herself to show how richly she was harmless she held up her volume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued for consideration to keep her distance she explained with as quenched a quaver as possible i saw you come out saw you from my window and couldnt bear to think you should find yourself here without the beginning of your book this is the beginning youve got the wrong volume and ive brought you out the right she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parley with a possible adversary and her intense her exalted little smile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemed to say as to which however the next minute she saw charlottes reply lose itself in a strange process a thing of several sharp stages which she could stand there and trace the dread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldnt believe in her having in so strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she had been made up to at least it was with an idea the idea that had struck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasnt insistently wasnt this shone from maggie with a force finally not to be resisted and on that perception on the immense relief so constituted everything had by the end of three minutes extraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was like a knife in her heart and in the very sight of her uncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to be grasped something of mrs assinghams picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continent had at first found fulfilment she had got away in this fashion burning behind her almost the ships of disguise to let her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggies approach had presented an innocent front it was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signs of her extremity it was not to be said for them either that they were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princess in spite of the dissimulation that with the return of comparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening of the spring of pride this for possible defence if not for possible aggression pride indeed the next moment had become the mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung it round her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomed was in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom so that to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke to confess to falsity she wouldnt confess she didnt a thousand times no she only cast about her and quite frankly and fiercely for something else that would give colour to her having burst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as she invoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish she could only help her to it she presently got up which seemed to mean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhile at random looking away looking at anything at everything but her visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declared that she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for the book which a little incoherently with her second volume she perhaps found less clever than she expected when she had let maggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched the tribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly its superfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down in another place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure no stranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairly agree to take her then for the poor little person she was finding it so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with which she might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter this possibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequately plain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large it had absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit of being large for each of them alike im glad to see you alone theres something ive been wanting to say to you im tired said mrs verver im tired tired it had dropped the next thing it couldnt all come at once but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flush of recognition was in her face tired of this life the one weve been leading you like it i know but ive dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding she was following her way maggie by the same influence sat in sight of it there was something she was saving some quantity of which she herself was judge and it was for a long moment even with the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deal like watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else she went on ive an idea that greatly appeals to me ive had it for a long time it has come over me that were wrong our real life isnt here maggie held her breath ours my husbands and mine im not speaking for you oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid im speaking for ourselves im speaking charlotte brought out for him i see for my father for your father for whom else they looked at each other hard now but maggies face took refuge in the intensity of her interest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat her companions question as requiring an answer a discretion that her controlled stillness had after an instant justified i must risk your thinking me selfish for of course you know what it involves let me admit it i am selfish i place my husband first well said maggie smiling and smiling since thats where i place mine you mean youll have no quarrel with me so much the better then for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed maggie waited her glimmer had deepened her chance somehow was at hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herself skirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take him home to his real position and not to wait do you mean a this season i mean immediately and i may as well tell you now i mean for my own time i want charlotte said to have him at last a little to myself i want strange as it may seem to you and she gave it all its weight to keep the man ive married and to do so i see i must act maggie with the effort still to follow the right line felt herself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfully echoed as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is after all but a detail that can always be done with money as he spends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know my difficulty far down below the level of attention in she could scarce have said what sacred depths maggies inspiration had come and it had trembled the next moment into sound do you mean im your difficulty you and he together since its always with you that ive had to see him but its a difficulty that im facing if you wish to know that ive already faced that i propose to myself to surmount the struggle with it none too pleasant hasnt been for me as you may imagine in itself charming ive felt in it at times if i must tell you all too great and too strange an ugliness yet i believe it may succeed she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for the emphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless at first but sat and looked at her you want to take my father from me the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotte turn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity of her deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed the night she stood in the drawingroom and denied that she had suffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would but give her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with her note of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with the signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of defeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver i happen also to feel that hes worth it maggie rose as if to receive her oh worth it she wonderfully threw off the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotte flamed aloft might truly have been believing in her passionate parade youve thought youve known what hes worth indeed then my dear i believe i have as i believe i still do she had given it maggie straight back and again it had not missed charlotte for another moment only looked at her then broke into the words maggie had known they would come of which she had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed our marriage do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she had laid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of the volumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flung it down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on her shoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see she broke out that youve worked against me oh oh oh the princess exclaimed her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways but on this turned round with a flare you havent worked against me maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closed eyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed by both hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matter if ive failed you recognise then that youve failed asked charlotte from the threshold maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a moment before at the two books on the seat she put them together and laid them down then she made up her mind ive failed she sounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all part sixth xl ill do anything you like she said to her husband on one of the last days of the month if our being here this way at this time seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or too impossible well either take leave of them now without waiting or well come back in time three days before they start ill go abroad with you if you but say the word to switzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of your old high places you would like most to see again those beautiful ones that used to do you good after rome and that you so often told me about where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer and where it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stale london september close at hand they should content themselves with remaining was where the desert of portland place looked blank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanning the horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks of immobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldnt be bettered and he even went at no moment through the form of replying that should their ordeal strike her as exceeding their patience any step they might take would be for her own relief this was no doubt partly because he stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by a weak word at least that any element of their existence was or ever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in that inconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he was consequent consequent with the admirable appearance he had from the first so undertaken and so continued to present rather too rigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not the little person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacit compact actually in operation between them might have been founded on an intelligent comparison a definite collation positively of the kinds of patience proper to each she was seeing him through he had engaged to come out at the right end if she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed from week to week had fairly received with the procession of the weeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to be insisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all on hers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplained and uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way by one of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so far from having even yet completely fallen from him happened handsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantages of his own freely to surrender but none to be persuadedly indebted to others for what did such a false face of the matter represent but the fact itself that she was pledged if she had questioned or challenged or interfered if she had reserved herself that right she wouldnt have been pledged whereas there were still and evidently would be yet a while long tense stretches during which their case might have been hanging for every eye on her possible her impossible defection she must keep it up to the last mustnt absent herself for three minutes from her post only on those lines assuredly would she show herself as with him and not against him it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invited him to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now in their suspense supremely waited a reflection under the brush of which she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of his forefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned in sequestered hours that he had a place and that this was an attribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid upon others from the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could of circling round him of remembering for his benefit the famous relation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one had gone into it but such a place as amerigos was like something made for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely of the sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggies own had come to show simply as that improvised post a post of the kind spoken of as advanced with which she was to have found herself connected in the fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in the likeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back and barbarous beadwork to sell maggies own in short would have been sought in vain in the most rudimentary map of the social relations as such the only geography marking it would be doubtless that of the fundamental passions the end that the prince was at all events holding out for was represented to expectation by his fatherinlaws announced departure for america with mrs verver just as that prospective event had originally figured as advising for discretion the flight of the younger couple to say nothing of the withdrawal of whatever other importunate company before the great upheaval of fawns this residence was to be peopled for a month by porters packers and hammerers at whose operations it had become peculiarly public public that is for portland place that charlotte was to preside in force operations the quite awful appointed scale and style of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggies mind as one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her ken besprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seen samson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she was not seeing rich dim things under the impression of which they had retired she having eyes at present but for the clock by which she timed her husband or for the glass the image perhaps would be truer in which he was reflected to her as he timed the pair in the country the accession of their friends from cadogan place contributed to all their intermissions at any rate a certain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by the upshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assingham and the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxious ladys last approach to her young friend at fawns that her sympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again to become inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to that need as on this question of the present odd line of the distinguished eccentrics you mean to say really that youre going to stick here and then before maggie could answer what on earth will you do with your evenings maggie waited a moment maggie could still tentatively smile when people learn were here and of course the papers will be full of it theyll flock back in their hundreds from wherever they are to catch us you see you and the colonel have yourselves done it as for our evenings they wont i dare say be particularly different from anything else thats ours they wont be different from our mornings or our afternoons except perhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get through them ive offered to go anywhere she added to take a house if he will but this just this and nothing else is amerigos idea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as he said described and fitted it so you see and the princess indulged again in her smile that didnt play but that only as might have been said worked so you see theres a method in our madness it drew mrs assinghams wonder and what then is the name the reduction to its simplest expression of what we are doing thats what he called it therefore as were doing nothing were doing it in the most aggravated way which is the way he desires with which maggie further said of course i understand so do i her visitor after a moment breathed youve had to vacate the house that was inevitable but at least here he doesnt funk our young woman accepted the expression he doesnt funk it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raised her eyebrows hes prodigious but what is there as youve fixed it to dodge unless she pursued its her getting near him its if youll pardon my vulgarity her getting at him that she suggested may count with him but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up can she fanny assingham questioned cant she maggie returned their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which the elder woman said i mean for seeing him alone so do i said the princess at which fanny for her reasons couldnt help smiling oh if its for that hes staying hes staying ive made it out to take anything that comes or calls upon him to take maggie went on even that then she put it as she had at last put it to herself hes staying for high decency decency mrs assingham gravely echoed decency if she should try well mrs assingham urged well i hope hope hell see her maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply its useless hoping she presently said she wont but he ought to her friends expression of a moment before which had been apologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated so simply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility of charlottes getting at the man who for so long had loved her should now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggies as to what might make for it or make against it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into a vague calculation of the conceivability on her own part with her husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it be too monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm at the lapse of the weeks wouldnt it really seem that youre bound in honour to do something for her privately before they go maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventure for her own spirit capable of sinking to intense little absences even while conversing as now with the person who had most of her confidence during which she followed up the possibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at such times somewhat restore the balance by not wholly failing to guess her thought her thought however just at present had more than one face had a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure of her concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility that she was after all sufficiently to get at him there was in fact that of her having again and again done so against this stood nothing but fanny assinghams apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actual relation of the parties over and beyond everything that from more than three months back of course had fostered in the princess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly be baseless inasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigos time that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once to the undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place been obliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of her personal possessions were in course of removal she didnt come to portland place didnt even come to ask for luncheon on two separate occasions when it reached the consciousness of the household there that she was spending the day in london maggie hated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weigh the idea of whether there hadnt been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview in an air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightnt perfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with such bravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not being appeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternative image the alternative image would have been that the secret covered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between the two kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joy she was hiding humiliation and here it was that the princesss passion so powerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised its tenderness against the hard glass of her question behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she had so fairly flattened her nose against it to penetrate the glass mrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggie had said to herself complacently after that last passage with her stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothing left for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasnt it still left to push further and from the point of view of personal pride grovel lower why wasnt it still left to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to him their friends anguish and convincing him of her need she could thus have translated mrs ververs tap against the glass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps have translated it most into the form of a reminder that would pierce deep you dont know what it is to have been loved and broken with you havent been broken with because in your relation what can there have been worth speaking of to break ours was everything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wine of consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no better meaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all for deception why condemned after a couple of short years to find the golden flame oh the golden flame a mere handful of black ashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what was insidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that for minutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed to rest upon her the duty of speaking before separation should constitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might be carried away into exile like the last saved object of price of the emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and negotiable some day in the market of misery this imagined service to the woman who could no longer help herself was one of the traps set for maggies spirit at every turn of the road the click of which catching and holding the divine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by a struggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering of fine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings of thought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldnt bring them down the arrest produced by the so remarkably distinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks was constantly crossing in its regular revolution the further end of any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didnt whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business in eaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the little man who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was part of the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment of the attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his secure pincenez the thing that never failed now as an item in the picture was that gleam of the silken noose his wifes immaterial tether so marked to maggies sense during her last month in the country mrs ververs straight neck had certainly not slipped it nor had the other end of the long cord oh quite conveniently long disengaged its smaller loop from the hooked thumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept out of sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play of this gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magic it was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be to doubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfect durability these reminded states for the princess were in fact states of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that she even yet didnt all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her in quick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of her thought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on his side in the premises to be capable of and then had felt her companions answering stare but she insisted on what she had meant he ought to wish to see her and i mean in some protected and independent way as he used to in case of her being herself able to manage it that said maggie with the courage of her conviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he ought to feel himself sworn little as it is for the end of such a history to take from her its as if he wished to get off without taking anything mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet for any purpose they like thats their affair fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back to her constant position youre splendid perfectly splendid to which as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldnt have it again at all she subjoined or if youre not its because youre so sure i mean sure of him ah im exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him i shouldnt doubt but maggie cast about her doubt what fanny pressed as she waited well that he must feel how much less than she he pays and how that ought to keep her present to him this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meet with a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trust him also to keep himself absent leave him his own way ill leave him everything said maggie only you know its my nature i think its your nature to think too much fanny assingham a trifle coarsely risked this but quickened however in the princess the act she reprobated that may be but if i hadnt thought you wouldnt you mean have been where you are yes because they on their side thought of everything but that they thought of everything but that i might think or even her friend too superficially concurred that your father might as to this at all events maggie discriminated no that wouldnt have prevented them for they knew that his first care would be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that has had to become his last fanny assingham took it in deeper for what it immediately made her give out louder hes splendid then she sounded it almost aggressively it was what she was reduced to she had positively to place it ah that as much as you please maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the next moment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but its what will have saved you oh maggie returned its what from the moment they discovered we could think at all will have saved them for theyre the ones who are saved she went on were the ones who are lost lost lost to each other father and i and then as her friend appeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lost to each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them its just its right its deserved while for us its only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but i dont know she went on why i talk about myself for its on father it really comes i let him go said maggie you let him but you dont make him i take it from him she answered but what else can you do i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knew from the first i should do i get off by giving him up but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesnt it moreover then she asked complete the very purpose with which he married that of making you and leaving you more free maggie looked at her long yes i help him to do that mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared why not call it then frankly his complete success well said maggie thats all thats left me to do its a success her friend ingeniously developed with which youve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spoke without levity mrs assingham went further he has made it a success for them ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she said the next moment thats why amerigo stays let alone its why charlotte goes that mrs assingham and emboldened smiled so he knows but maggie hung back amerigo after which however she blushed to her companions recognition your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggies silence and maggies eyes had in fact arrested the push of the question which for a decent consistency she couldnt yet quite abandon what i should rather say is does he know how much she found it still awkward how much i mean they did how far she touched it up they went maggie had waited but only with a question do you think he does know at least something oh about him i cant think hes beyond me said fanny assingham then do you yourself know how much how much how far how far fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was something she remembered remembered in time and even with a smile ive told you before that i know absolutely nothing well thats what i know said the princess her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does oh maggie showed that she understood nobody not a little charlotte a little the princess echoed to know anything would be for her to know enough and she doesnt know anything if she did maggie answered amerigo would and thats just it that he doesnt thats just it said the princess profoundly on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte so held just by that by her ignorance by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes her companion a moment watched them but the prince then how is he held maggie asked how is he held oh i cant tell you that and the princess again broke off xli a telegram in charlottes name arrived early we shall come and ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring for the assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings were to be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding the remark that her father and his wife who would have come up the previous night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone halfadozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well as the times were scattered about him but with a cigar in his teeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to be engaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approaching him for she had done it of late under one necessity or another several times had a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round on her entrance the reason was partly the look in his face a suffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to her fanny assinghams charge recently uttered under that roof of her thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with her and made her think still more so that at first as she stood there she felt responsible for provoking on his part an irritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had been going about him these three months she perfectly knew with a maintained idea of which she had never spoken to him but what had at last happened was that his way of looking at her on occasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehow must reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad to be coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than a telegram but even after she had stepped into his prison under her pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embraced the four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised the virtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlottes situation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitude of a great residence she had found with so little seeking the similitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the man who couldnt now without an instant effect on her sensibility give an instinctive push to the door she had not completely closed behind her he had been turning twenty ways for impatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with him it was yet again as if she had come to him in his more than monastic cell to offer him light or food there was a difference none the less between his captivity and charlottes the difference as it might be of his lurking there by his own act and his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtually been in his starting on her entrance as if even this were in its degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it was more wonderful than she could have told it was for all the world as if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that the imputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she had begun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him think more of her but what was it after all he was thinking now he kept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy as it was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in the garden at fawns with charlotte that she had truly come unarmed she didnt bristle with intentions she scarce knew as he at this juncture affected her what had become of the only intention she had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old one he knew she hadnt the ghost of another presently in fact when four or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadnt so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wished him to do she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegram together as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the while holding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by the action of their merely having between them these few written words an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if he were hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity and an intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that were like the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuck and making them feel they floated what was it that with the rush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficial impetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart she had so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catch at her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldnt immediately have said what saved her and by the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing something merely needful i wanted you simply to know so that you maynt by accident miss them for its the last said maggie the last i take it as their goodbye and she smiled as she could always smile they come in state to take formal leave they do everything thats proper tomorrow she said they go to southampton if they do everything thats proper the prince presently asked why dont they at least come to dine she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer that we must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but of course theyre immensely taken he wondered so immensely taken that they cant that your father cant give you his last evening in england this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was still not without her stopgap that may be what theyll propose that we shall go somewhere together the four of us for a celebration except that to round it thoroughly off we ought also to have fanny and the colonel they dont want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poor dears they get rid of them beforehand they want only us together and if they cut us down to tea she continued as they cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps its for the fancy after all of their keeping their last night in london for each other she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keep them back even though as she heard herself she might have been throwing everything to the winds but wasnt that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored it was every moment more and more for her as if she were waiting with him in his prison waiting with some gleam of remembrance of how noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of the terror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their last poor resources if she had broken with everything now every observance of all the past months she must simply then take it so take it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her head verily in her husbands eyes since he didnt know all the while that the sudden freedom of her words was but the diverted intensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didnt know either that this was her manner now she was with him of beguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the people of the french revolution assuredly there wasnt suspense the scaffold for those she was thinking of was certain whereas what charlottes telegram announced was short of some incalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearances those she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clusters of angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating down through iron bars that regale on occasion precisely the fevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later on was going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart had beaten at this foretaste of their being left together she should judge at leisure the surrender she was making to the consciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted she should judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which was making so little of any complication but the unextinguished presence of the others and indeed that she was already simplifying so much more than her husband came out for her next in the face with which he listened he might certainly well be puzzled in respect to his fatherinlaw and mrs verver by her glance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isnt is it he asked as if they were leaving each other oh no it isnt as if they were leaving each other theyre only bringing to a close without knowing when it may open again a time that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their time she was somehow sustained she was sustained even to affirm more intensely her present possession of her ground they have their reasons many things to think of how can one tell but theres always also the chance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hours together i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me off to dine with him somewhere alone and to do it in memory of old days i mean the princess went on the real old days before my grand husband was invented and much more before his grand wife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in what he has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way weve sat together late ever so late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the way that in every city in europe weve stayed on and on with our elbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk over things he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were places he took me to you wouldnt believe for often he could only have left me with servants if he should carry me off with him tonight for old sakes sake to the earls court exhibition it will be a little just a very very little like our young adventures after which while amerigo watched her and in fact quite because of it she had an inspiration to which she presently yielded if he was wondering what she would say next she had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave you charlotte to take care of in our absence youll have to carry her off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer to spend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that you have everything quite beautifully youll be able to do as you like she couldnt have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting her see that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or of oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been so sweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to make no mistake about it she troubled him which hadnt been at all her purpose she mystified him which she couldnt help and comparatively didnt mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she had never dared to presume it was a discovery not like the other discovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and she recognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas of which he thought her capable they were all apparently queer for him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was at present providing him with there was something of his own in his mind to which she was sure he referred everything for a measure and a meaning he had never let go of it from the evening weeks before when in her room after his encounter with the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging it at him on the question of her fathers view of him her determined find out for yourself she had been aware during the months that he had been trying to find out and had been seeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions of such a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence or with a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at all conveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even from the announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession of their companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was in torment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligation to follow her husband that personage and she maggie had so shuffled away every link between consequence and cause that the intention remained like some famous poetic line in a dead language subject to varieties of interpretation what renewed the obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her fathers and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of form and all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel with it on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was now all at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas or perhaps fortynine of them wouldnt be exactly that taste by itself the taste he had always conformed to had no importance whatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as she perhaps might never be able to profit again she was invoking that reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply to her last words a remark which though perfectly relevant and perfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity theyre doing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever to go and he looked down at her over his cigar if they were ever to go in short it was high time with her fathers age charlottes need of initiation and the general magnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned their learning to live into their queer future it was high time that they should take up their courage this was eminent sense but it didnt arrest the princess who the next moment had found a form for her challenge but shant you then so much as miss her a little shes wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as if she were dying not really not physically maggie went on shes so far naturally splendid as she is from having done with life but dying for us for you and me and making us feel it by the very fact of there being so much of her left the prince smoked hard a minute as you say shes splendid but there is there always will be much of her left only as you also say for others and yet i think the princess returned that it isnt as if we had wholly done with her how can we not always think of her its as if her unhappiness had been necessary to us as if we had needed her at her own cost to build us up and start us he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucid inquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your fathers wife they exchanged a long look the time that it took her to find her reply because not to well not to would make me have to speak of him and i cant said maggie speak of him you cant i cant she said it as for definite notice not to be repeated there are too many things she nevertheless added hes too great the prince looked at his cigartip and then as he put back the weed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not my dear too great for you he declared for me oh as much as you like too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggie said thats enough he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder he was on the very point she judged of asking her why she thought it but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end of a minute he had uttered other words whats of importance is that youre his daughter that at least weve got and i suppose that if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i value it oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most of it this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him a striking connection she ought to have known you thats whats present to me she ought to have understood you better better than you did yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didnt really know you at all she doesnt know you now ah yes she does said maggie but he shook his head he knew what he meant she not only doesnt understand you more than i she understands you ever so much less though even i well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even i even yet again he paused and the silence held them but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesnt understand me it is that ive prevented her ive chosen to deceive her and to lie to her the prince kept his eyes on her i know what youve chosen to do but ive chosen to do the same yes said maggie after an instant my choice was made when i had guessed yours but you mean she asked that she understands you it presents small difficulty are you so sure maggie went on sure enough but it doesnt matter he waited an instant then looking up through the fumes of his smoke shes stupid he abruptly opined o oh maggie protested in a long wail it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean is that shes not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesnt know doesnt know she tried to make his logic difficult doesnt know that you know it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think thats all it need take and before he could reply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed well then what but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away from him oh i neednt tell you she knows enough besides she went on she doesnt believe us it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much that drew however from his wife another moan of objection which determined in him a judgment she wont let you take her for unhappy oh i know better than any one else what she wont let me take her for very well said amerigo youll see i shall see wonders i know ive already seen them and im prepared for them maggie recalled she had memories enough its terrible her memories prompted her to speak i see its always terrible for women the prince looked down in his gravity everythings terrible cara in the heart of man shes making her life he said shell make it his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while shes about it shes making ours at this he raised his eyes which met her own and she held him while she delivered herself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes you spoke just now of charlottes not having learned from you that i know am i to take from you then that you accept and recognise my knowledge he did the inquiry all the honours visibly weighed its importance and weighed his response you think i might have been showing you that a little more handsomely it isnt a question of any beauty said maggie its only a question of the quantity of truth oh the quantity of truth the prince richly though ambiguously murmured thats a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith of course there are the prince hastened to reply after which he brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning of time acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simply for that for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like some handful of golddust thrown into the air for that then maggie showed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see and she even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him as divine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he could say she wasnt talking however at large youve kept up for so long a silence yes yes i know what ive kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had made her turn pale is there even one thing left ah my dear my dear my dear it had pressed again in him the fine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however that the princess herself couldnt say ill do anything if youll tell me what then wait and his raised italian hand with its play of admonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive his voice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till theyve been here you mean yes till theyve gone till theyre away she kept it up till theyve left the country she had her eyes on him for clearness these were the conditions of a promise so that he put the promise practically into his response till weve ceased to see them for as long as god may grant till were really alone oh if its only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definite which was the intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadnt had them for so long she turned away again she put her hand on the knob of the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp she had another effort to make the effort of leaving him of which everything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty there was something she couldnt have told what it was as if shut in together they had come too far too far for where they were so that the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt to recover the lost and gone she had taken in with her something that within the ten minutes and especially within the last three or four had slipped away from her which it was vain now wasnt it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up that consciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endless power of surrender he had only to press really for her to yield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while she looked at him through her cloud that the confession of this precious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation for the few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire so long as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face like a light or a darkness she sought for some word that would cover this up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if they shouldnt meet sooner then about five i count on you on him too however something had descended as to which this exactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no he said coming nearer she had with her hand still on the knob her back against the door so that her retreat under his approach must be less than a step and yet she couldnt for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touch him taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressed upon her and the warmth of his face frowning smiling she mightnt know which only beautiful and strange was bent upon her with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams she closed her eyes to it and so the next instant against her purpose she had put out her hand which had met his own and which he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes the right word came wait it was the word of his own distress and entreaty the word for both of them all they had left their plank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus she said it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but her hand she knew helped her meaning which after a minute she was aware his own had absorbed he let her go he turned away with this message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window she had saved herself and she got off xlii later on in the afternoon before the others arrived the form of their reunion was at least remarkable they might in their great eastward drawingroom have been comparing notes or nerves in apprehension of some stiff official visit maggies mind in its restlessness even played a little with the prospect the high cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestries uncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflecting the bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of the prepared teatable drew from her a remark in which this whole effect was mirrored as well as something else in the princes movement while he slowly paced and turned were distinctly bourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of their old community though to a spectator sufficiently detached they might have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance to repair together to the foot of the staircase the prince somewhat in front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in full possession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the long windows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seen amerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of her return from the regents park near by with her father the principino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctual impatience went out a couple of times and stood there after which as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to the room with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended to read he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her own sense the thought of other occasions when she had cheated appearances of agitation with a book at last she felt him standing before her and then she raised her eyes do you remember how this morning when you told me of this event i asked you if there were anything particular you wished me to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter of course you spoke of something else he went on while she sat with her book on her knee and her raised eyes something that makes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of the possibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me ah its your own business now said his wife but it had made her rise i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i lied to her ah no she returned and i shall tell her you did she shook her head again oh still less with which therefore they stood at difference he with his head erect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know she isnt to know shes only still to think you dont and therefore that im always a fool she may think said maggie what she likes think it without my protest the princess made a movement what business is it of yours isnt it my right to correct her maggie let his question ring ring long enough for him to hear it himself only then she took it up correct her and it was her own now that really rang arent you rather forgetting who she is after which while he quite stared for it as it was the very first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung down her book and raised a warning hand the carriage come the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of her speech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alighted on the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it to her house later on upstairs again she even herself felt still more the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlottes affirmed presence as charlotte affirmed it she drew a long breath of richer relief it was the strangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the halfhour was that mr and mrs verver were making the occasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for a present effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them and there occurred before long a moment in which amerigos look met her own in recognitions that he couldnt suppress the question of the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herself open rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed to give to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a show of serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was a cool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some coloured and gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drank her tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission her mission had quite taken form it was but another name for the interest of her great opportunity that of representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutes before that she needed no showing as to what their friend wouldnt consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeed was to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between the varieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put the matter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held our young womans attention for the first quarterofanhour to the very point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeed at this time even with his daughter by his so marked peculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and so long as they were in the room together she felt him still simply weave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself in presence of this tacit process very much as she had known herself at fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of moving about the room noiselessly to see what it might contain and his manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as he already was with the objects in view expressed with a certain sharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices it did even more than this it signified to the apprehension of the princess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited in their rarity together with an independent a settled appreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcely required the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and her host the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she took her place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not less sustained for being superficial and the only approach to a break in it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for his fatherinlaw vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite or address him and then in default of any such word selected for presentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggie watched her husband if it now could be called watching offer this refreshment she noted the consummate way for consummate was the term she privately applied in which charlotte cleared her acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slow surge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two had floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at a picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had given her on her marriage he might have been in silence taking his last leave of it it was a work for which he entertained she knew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for her by his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense a part of the whole infusion of the immortal expression the beauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from the beauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window for his spiritual face she might have said to herself at this moment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in her clasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving her a part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abiding felicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failed them through their having passed too far she would have begun to wonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the last stage to find their contact like that of old friends reunited too much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses its all right eh oh my dear rather he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture as she had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if their words for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so that they looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in the room the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables the cabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stood out round them consciously for recognition and applause their eyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the whole nobleness quite as if for him to measure the wisdom of old ideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves however unwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniture required esthetically by such a scene the fusion of their presence with the decorative elements their contribution to the triumph of selection was complete and admirable though to a lingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion really demanded they also might have figured as concrete attestations of a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone in which adam verver spoke again and who shall say where his thought stopped le compte y est youve got some good things maggie met it afresh ah dont they look well their companions at the sound of this gave them in a spacious intermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that was like an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies of the contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud im so glad for your last look with which after maggie quite in the air had said it the note was struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality of relation as from couple to couple which almost escaped an awkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was the wonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because of the vast quantities with which it dealt so that separation was on a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hour justice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in the upper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure there was no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo or charlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in danger of doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her father wouldnt by the tip of a toe of that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didnt she could but hold her breath for what he would do instead when at the end of three minutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well mag and the principino it was quite as if that were by contrast the hard the truer voice she glanced at the clock i ordered him for halfpast five which hasnt yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you oh i dont want him to fail me was mr ververs reply yet uttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilities of failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in his impatience to one of the long windows and passed out to the balcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there she followed him of necessity it came absolutely so near to his inviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to give the others something of the chance that she and her husband had so fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung over the great dull place clear and almost coloured now coloured with the odd sad pictured oldfashioned look that empty london streets take on in waning afternoons of the summers end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been to them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had so much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of their eyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to be reckoned with if the instinct of each she could certainly at least answer for her own had not so successfully acted to trump up other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which they could pretend to be frank you mustnt stay on here you know adam verver said as a result of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of course to the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled he added with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents and half its best things removed wont seem to you im afraid particularly lively no maggie answered we should miss its best things its best things my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the force of her idea oh to be back there without anything good but she didnt hesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back there without charlotte is more than i think would do and as she smiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for an allusion to what she didnt and couldnt say this quantity was too clear that she couldnt at such an hour be pretending to name to him what it was as he would have said going to be at fawns or anywhere else to want for him that was now and in a manner exaltedly sublimely out of their compass and their question so that what was she doing while they waited for the principino while they left the others together and their tension just sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer a bold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlottes presence than the fact of a felt sincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear you know she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds but she was to know when these were over that she had pronounced one of the happiest words of her life they had turned from the view of the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but with the prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not even his taking out his cigarettecase and saying before he said anything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement with her my dear again and then while he struck his match she had just another minute to be nervous a minute that she made use of however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with a high ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pair inside father father charlottes great it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked at her charlottes great they could close upon it such a basis as they might immediately feel it make and so they stood together over it quite gratefully each recording to the others eyes that it was firm under their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proof of it much as if he were letting her see while the minutes lapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally just why but just why you see he presently added how right i was right i mean to do it for you ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to be herself ideally right i dont see what you would have done without her the point was he returned quietly that i didnt see what you were to do yet it was a risk it was a risk said maggie but i believed in it at least for myself she smiled well now he smoked we see we see i know her better you know her best oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hung in the air the truth warranted as who should say exactly by the present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity created and accepted she found herself lost though with a finer thrill than she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he might mean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each moment that he invited her thus to see him linger and when after a little more he had said smoking again and looking up with head thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house shes beautiful beautiful her sensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was all she might have wished for it was with a kind of speaking competence the note of possession and control and yet it conveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of their parting they were parting in the light of it absolutely on charlottes value the value that was filling the room out of which they had stepped as if to give it play and with which the prince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance if maggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusive comfortable category to place him in for dismissal she might have found it here in its all coming back to his ability to rest upon high values somehow when all was said and with the memory of her gifts her variety her power so much remained of charlottes what else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great great for the world that was before her that he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted in the application of his plan maggie held to this then that she wasnt to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had sought this brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she could speak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events was turned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy went straight its success father its success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isnt altogether failure they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to the room by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got up seemingly with an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to give further effect to her own entrance she had retired but the principinos presence by itself sufficiently broke the tension the subsidence of which in the great room ten minutes later gave to the air something of the quality produced by the cessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince and princess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created so that whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkable salience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggies going out to the balcony again to follow with her eyes her fathers departure the carriage was out of sight it had taken her too long solemnly to reascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space on which as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come up with the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual in remarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared then to have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something for the princess that her husband had thus got their son out of the way not bringing him back to his mother but everything now as she vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that the unheard chorus swelled yet this above all her just being there as she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to be together there always was the meaning most disengaged she stood in the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had been persistently able how to her soul all the while it had been for the sake of this end here it was then the moment the golden fruit that had shone from afar only what were these things in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tasted what were they as a reward closer than she had ever been to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has been suspense always precedes on the part of the creature to be paid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it the amount he still held it and the delay in his return making her heart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light on a wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand was over her cast he opened the door however at last he hadnt been away ten minutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone as he paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and even before he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with that consciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred the assurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his own anxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everything that was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the moneybag for her to come and take it but what instantly rose for her between the act and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him as waiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a new horror if that was her proper payment she would go without money his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at the expense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater style she had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to the uttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it on the spot forever isnt she too splendid she simply said offering it to explain and to finish oh splendid with which he came over to her thats our help you see she added to point further her moral it kept him before her therefore taking in or trying to what she so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please her to meet her in her own way but with the result only that close to her her face kept before him his hands holding her shoulders his whole act enclosing her he presently echoed see i see nothing but you and the truth of it had with this force after a moment so strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity and dread of them she buried her own in his breast
