the gray madam by anna katharine green mrs charles rohlfs copyright by earle h eaton was it a specter for days i could not answer this question i am no believer in spiritual manifestations yet but let me tell my story i was lodging with my wife on the first floor of a house in twentyseventh street i had taken the apartments for three months and we had already lived in them two and found them sufficiently comfortable the back room we used as a bedroom and while it communicated with the hall we invariably made use of the front parlordoor to go in and out of two great leaves of old mahogany connected the two rooms and as we received but few friends these doors usually stood half open one morning my wife being ill i left her lying in bed and stepped into the parlor preparatory to going out for breakfast it was late nine oclock probably and i was hastening to leave when i heard a sound behind me or did i merely feel a presence and turning saw a strange and totally unknown woman coming toward me from my wifes room as i had just left that room and as there was no way of getting into it except through a door we always kept locked i was so overpowered by my astonishment that i never thought of speaking or moving until she had passed me then i found voice and calling out madam endeavored to stop her but the madam if madam she was passed on as quietly as mechanically even as if i had not raised my voice and before i could grasp the fact that she was melting from before me flitted through the hall to the front door and so out leaving behind on the palm of my hand the feel of her wool dress which i had just managed to touch not understanding her or myself or the strange thrill awakened by this contact i tore open the front door and looked out expecting of course to see her on the steps or on the sidewalk in front but there was no one of her appearance visible and i came back questioning whether i was the victim of a hallucination or just an everyday fool to satisfy myself on this important question i looked about for the hallboy with the intention of asking him if he had seen any such person go out but that young and inconsequent scamp was missing from his post as usual and there was no one within sight to appeal to there was nothing to do but to reenter my rooms where my attention was immediately arrested by the sight of my wife sitting up in bed and surveying me with a look of unmistakable astonishment who was that woman she asked and how came she in here so she had seen her too what woman lydia i have not let in any woman did you think there was a woman in this room not in that room she answered hoarsely but in this one i saw her just now passing through the folding doors wilbur i am frightened see how my hands shake do you think i am sick enough to imagine things i knew she was not but i did not say so i thought it would be better for her to think herself under some such delusion you were dozing said i if you had seen a woman here you could tell me how she looked and i can my wife broke in excitedly she was like the ghosts we read of only that her dress and the veil or drapery she wore were all gray didnt you see her you must have seen her she went right by you a gray woman all gray a lady wilbur and slightly lame could i have dreamed all that you must have i cried shaking the one door communicating with the hall so she might see it was locked and even showing her the key of it lying in its accustomed place behind the bureau cushion yet i was in no satisfied condition myself for she had described with the greatest accuracy the very person i had myself seen had we been alike the victims of a spiritual manifestation this was tuesday on friday my question seemed to receive an answer i had been down town as usual and on returning found a crowd assembled in front of my lodginghouse a woman had been run over and was being carried into our rooms in the glimpse i caught of her i saw that she was middleaged and was wrapped in a long black cloak later this cloak fell off as her hat had done long before and i perceived that her dress was black and decent she was laid on our bed and every attention paid her but she had been grievously injured about the head and gradually but surely sank before our eyes suddenly she roused and gave a look about her it was a remarkable one a look of recognition and almost of delight then she raised one hand and pointing with a significant gesture into the empty space before her sank back and died it was a sudden ending and anxious to see its effect upon my wife who was standing on the other side of the bed i glanced her way with some misgiving she showed more feeling than i had anticipated indeed her countenance was a study and when under the influence of my scrutiny she glanced my way i saw that something of deeper import than this unexpected death in our rooms lay at the bottom of her uneasy look what that was i was soon to know for catching up from amid the folds of the womans graylined cloak a long gray veil which had fallen at the bedside she disposed it softly about the womans face darting me a look full of significance you remember the vision i had the morning when i was sick she whispered softly in my ear i nodded secretly thrilled to my very hearts core well it was a vision of this woman if she were living and on her feet and wrapped as i have shown you in this veil you would behold a living picture of the person i saw passing out of this room that morning i shall not dispute you i answered alas i had myself perceived the likeness the minute the veil had fallen about the pinched but handsome features a forewarning whispered my wife a forewarning of what has this day happened under our roof it was a wraith we saw wilbur i shall not spend another night in these rooms and we did not i was as anxious to leave as she was yet i am not a superstitious man as proof of it after the first effect of these events had left me i began to question my first impressions and feel tolerably ashamed of my past credulity though the phenomenon we had observed could not to all appearance be explained by any natural hypothesis though i had seen and my wife had seen a strange woman suddenly become visible in a room which a moment before had held no one but ourselves and into which no live woman could have entered without our knowledge something was it my natural good sense recoiled before a supernatural explanation of this and i found myself forced to believe that our first visitor had been as real as the last in other words the same woman but could i prove it could the seemingly impossible be made possible and the unexplainable receive a solution satisfying to a rational mind i determined to make an effort to accomplish this if only to relieve the mind of my wife who had not recovered her equanimity as readily as myself starting with the assumption above mentioned that the woman who had died in our presence was the same who had previously found an unexplainable entrance into these same rooms i first inquired if the black cloak lined with gray did not offer a solution to some of my previous difficulties it was a long cloak enveloping her completely when worn with the black side out she would present an inconspicuous appearance but with the gray side out and the effect of this heightened by a long gray veil flung over her hat she would look like the gray lady i had first seen now a cloak can be turned in an instant and if she had chosen to do this in flitting through my door i would naturally find only a sedate blackclothed woman passing up the street when rousing from the apathy into which her appearance had thrown me i rushed to the front door and looked out had i seen such a woman i seemed to remember that i had thus much then was satisfactory but to account for her entrance into our rooms was not so easy had she slipped by me in coming in as she had on going out the parlor door was open for i had been out to get the paper could she have glided in by me unperceived and thus have found her way into the bedroom from which i afterward saw her issue no for i had stood facing the front hall door all the time through the bedroom door then but that was as i have said locked here was a mystery then but it was one worth solving my first step was to recall all that i had heard of the actual woman who had been buried from our rooms her name as ascertained in the cheap boardinghouse to which she was traced was helmuth and she was so far as any one knew without friends or relatives in the city to those who saw her daily she was a harmless slightly demented woman with money enough to live above want but not enough to warrant her boasting talk about the rich things she was going to buy some day and the beautiful presents she would soon be in a position to give away the money found on her person was sufficient to bury her but no papers were in her possession nor any letters calculated to throw light upon her past life her lameness had been caused by paralysis but the date of her attack was not known finding no clue in this to what i wished to learn i went back to our old rooms which had not been let since our departure and sought for one there and strangely enough i found it i thought i knew everything there was to be known about the apartment we had lived in two months but one little fact had escaped me which under the scrutiny that i now gave it became apparent this was simply that the key which opened the hall door of the bedroom and which we had seldom if ever used was not as old a key as that of the corresponding door in the parlor and this fact small as it was led me to make inquiries the result was that i learned something about the couple who had preceded us in the use of these rooms they were of middle age and of great personal elegance but uncertain pay the husband being nothing more nor less than a professional gambler their name was lhommedieu when i first heard of them i thought that mrs lhommedieu might be the mrs helmuth in whose history i was so interested but from all i could learn she was a very different sort of person mrs lhommedieu was gay dashing and capable of making a show out of a flimsy silk a shopgirl would hesitate to wear yet she looked distinguished and wore her cheap jewelry with more grace than many a woman her diamonds i would consequently have dropped this inquiry if some one had not remarked upon her having had a paralytic stroke after leaving the house this together with the fact that the key to the rear door which i had found replaced by a new one had been taken away by her and never returned connected her so indubitably with my mysterious visitor that i resolved to pursue my investigations into mrs lhommedieus past for this purpose i sought out a quaint little maidenlady living on the top floor who i was told knew more about the lhommedieus than any one in the building miss winterburn whose acquaintance i had failed to make while residing in the house was a fluttering eager affable person whose one delight was as i soon found to talk about the lhommedieus of the story she related i give as much as i can of it in her own words i was never their equal said she but mrs lhommedieu was lonely and having no friends in town was good enough to admit me to her parlor now and then and even to allow me to accompany her to the theater when her husband was away on one of his mysterious visits i never liked mr lhommedieu but i did like her she was so different from me and when i first knew her so gay and so full of conversation but after awhile she changed and was either feverishly cheerful or morbidly sad so that my visits caused me more pain than pleasure the reason for these changes in her was patent to everybody though her husband was a handsome man he was as unprincipled as he was unfortunate he gambled this she once admitted to me and while at long intervals he met with some luck he more often returned dispirited and with that hungry ravening look you expect to see in a wolf cheated of its prey i used to be afraid he would strike her after some one of these disappointments but i do not think he ever did she had a determined character of her own and there have been times when i have thought he was as much afraid of her as she was of him i became sure of this after one night mrs lhommedieu and myself were having a little supper together in the front parlor you have so lately occupied it was a very ordinary supper for the lhommedieus purse had run low and mrs lhommedieu was not the woman to spend much at any time on her eating it was palatable however and had been cooked by us both together and i was enjoying it and would have enjoyed it more if mrs lhommedieu had had more appetite but she ate scarcely anything and seemed very anxious and unhappy though she laughed now and then with sudden gusts of mirth too hysterical to be real it was not late and yet we were both very much surprised when there came a knock at the door followed by the entrance of a visitor mrs lhommedieu who is always la grande dame rose without apparent embarrassment to meet the gentleman who entered though i knew she could not help but feel keenly the niggardly appearance of the board she left with such grace the stranger he was certainly a stranger this i could see by the formality of her manner was a gentleman of urbane bearing and a general air of prosperity i remember every word that passed my name is lafarge said he i am or rather have been under great obligations to your husband and i have come to discharge my debt is he at home mrs lhommedieus eye which had sparkled at his name dropped suddenly as he put the final question i am sorry she returned after a moment of embarrassment but my husband is very seldom home evenings if you could come about noon some day thank you said he with a bright smile but i will finish my business now and with you seeing that mr lhommedieu is not at home years ago i am sure you have heard your husband mention my name i borrowed quite a sum of money from him which i have never paid you recall the amount no doubt i have heard mr lhommedieu say it was a thousand dollars she replied with a sudden fluttering of her hands indicative of great excitement that is the sum he allowed either not noticing me or thinking me too insignificant to be considered i regret to have kept him so long out of it but i have not forgotten to add the interest in making out this statement of my indebtedness and if you will look over this paper and acknowledge its correctness i will leave the equivalent of my debt here and now for i sail for europe tomorrow morning and wish to have all my affairs in order before leaving mrs lhommedieu who looked ready to faint from excess of feeling summoned up her whole strength looking so beautiful as she did so that one forgot the ribbons on her sleeves were no longer fresh and that the silk dress she wore hung in the very limpest of folds i am obliged to you she said in a tone from which she strove in vain to suppress all eagerness and if i may speak for mr lhommedieu he will be as grateful for your remembrance of us as for the money you so kindly offer to return to him the stranger bowed low and took out a folded paper which he handed her he was not deceived i am sure by her grand airs and knew as well as i did that no woman ever stood in greater need of money but nothing in his manner betrayed this knowledge it is a bond i give you he now explained as you will see it has coupons attached to it which you can cash at any time it will prove as valuable to you as so much ready money and possibly more convenient and with just this hint which i took as significant of his complete understanding of her position he took her receipt and politely left the house once alone with me who am nobody her joy had full vent i have never seen any one so lost in delight as she was for a few minutes to have this money thrust upon her just at a moment when actual want seemed staring her in the face was too much of a relief for her to conceal either the misery she had been under or the satisfaction she now enjoyed under the gush of her emotions her whole history came out but as you have often heard the like i will not repeat it especially as it was all contained in the cry with which a little later she thrust the bond toward me he must not see it he must not it would go like all the rest and i would again be left without a cent take it and keep it for i have no means of concealing it here he is too suspicious but this was asking more than i was willing to grant seeing how i felt she thrust the paper into her bosom with a look before which i secretly recoiled you will not charge yourself with such a responsibility said she but i can trust you not to tell him yes i nodded feeling sick of the whole business then but here the door was violently flung open and without any warning mr lhommedieu burst into the room in a state of as much excitement as his wife only his was the excitement of desperation gone gone he cried ignoring me as completely as had mr lafarge not a dollar left not even my studs see and he pointed to his shirt front hanging apart in a way i would never have looked for in this reckless but fastidious gentleman yet if i had had a dollar more or even a ring worth a dollar or so i might have theresa have you any money at all a coin now might save us mrs lhommedieu who had turned alarmingly pale drew up her fine figure and resolutely confronted him no said she and shifting her gaze she turned it meaningly upon me he misunderstood this movement thinking it simply a reminder of my presence he turned and with his false but impressive show of courtesy made me a low bow then he forgot me utterly again and facing his wife growled out where are you going to get breakfast then you dont look like a woman who expects to starve it was a fatal remark for do what she would she could not prevent a slight smile of disdain and seeing it he kept his eyes riveted on her face till her uneasiness became manifest instantly his suspicion took form and surveying her still more fixedly he espied a corner of the precious paper protruding slightly above her corsage to snatch it out open it and realize its value was the work of a moment her cry of dismay and his shout of mad triumph rang out simultaneously and never have i seen such an ebullition of opposing passions as i was made witness to as his hand closed over this small fortune and their staring eyes met in the mortal struggle they had now entered upon for its ultimate possession she was the first to speak it was given to me it was meant for me if i keep it both of us will profit by it but if you he did not wait for her to finish where did you get it he cried i can break the bank with what i can raise on this bond at the club darraughs in town you know what that means lucks in the air and with an hundred dollars but ive no time to talk i came for a dollar a fiftycent piece a dime even and i go back with a bond worth but she was already between him and the door you will never carry that bond out of this house she whispered in the tone which goes further than any cry i have not held it in my hand to see it follow every other good thing i have had in life i will not henry take that bond and sink it as you have all the rest and i fall at your feet a dead woman i will never survive the destruction of my last hope he was cowed for a moment that is she looked so superb and so determined then all that was mean and despicable in his thinly veneered nature came to the surface and springing forward with an oath he was about to push her aside when without the moving of a finger on her part he reeled back recovered himself caught at a chair missed it and fell heavily to the floor my god i thank thee was the exclamation with which she broke from the trance of terror into which she had been thrown by his sudden attempt to pass her and without a glance at his face which to me looked like the face of a dead man she tore the paper from his hand and stood looking about her with a wild and searching gaze in the desperate hope that somehow the walls would open and offer her a safe place of concealment for the precious sheet of paper meanwhile i had crept near the prostrate man he was breathing but was perfectly unconscious dont you mean to do something for him i asked he may die she met my question with the dazed air of one suddenly awakened no hell not die but hell not come to for some minutes and this must be hidden first but where where i cannot trust it on my person or in any place a man like him would search i must devise some means ah with this final exclamation she had dashed into the other room i did not see where she went i did not want to but i soon realized she was working somewhere in a desperate hurry i could hear her breath coming in quick short pants as i bent over her husband waiting for him to rouse and hating my inaction even while i succumbed to it suddenly she was back in the parlor again and to my surprise passed immediately to the little table in the corner where we had sat at supper we had had for our simple refreshment that homeliest of all dishes boiled milk thickened with flour there was still some left in a bowl and taking this away with her she called back hoarsely pray that he does not come to till i have finished it will be the best prayer you ever made she told me afterward that he was subject to these attacks and that she had long ceased to be alarmed by them but to me the sight of this man lying there so helpless was horrible and though i hated him and pitied her i scarcely knew what to wish while battling with my desire to run and the feeling of loyalty which held me kneeling at that mans side i heard her speak again this time in an even and slightly hard tone now you may dash a glass of cold water in his face i am prepared to meet him happily his memory fails him after these attacks i may succeed in making him believe that the bond he saw was one of his fancies had you not better throw the water yourself i suggested getting up and meeting her eye very quietly she looked at me in wonder then moved calmly to the table took the glass and dashed a few drops of water into her husbands face instantly he began to stir seeing which i arose without haste but without any unnecessary delay and quietly took my leave i could bear no more that night next morning i awoke in a fright i had dreamed that he had come to my room in search of the bond but it was only her knock at the door and her voice asking if she might enter at this early hour it was such a relief i gladly let her in and she entered with her best air and flung herself on my little lounge with the hysterical cry he has sent me up i told him i ought not to intrude at such an inconvenient hour that you would not have had your breakfast how carelessly she spoke how hard she tried to keep the hungry note out of her voice but he insisted upon my coming up i know why he searched me before i left the room and now he wants to search the room itself then he did remember i began yes he remembers now i saw it in his eyes as soon as he awoke but he will not find the bond that is safe and some day when i shall have escaped his vigilance long enough to get it back again i will use it so as to make him as well as myself comfortable i am not a selfish woman i did not think she was and i felt pity for her and so after dressing and making her a cup of tea i can myself do very well without one on a pinch i sat down with her and we chatted for an hour or so quite comfortably then she grew so restless and consulted the clock so often that i tried to soothe her by remarking that it was not an easy task he had set himself at which she laughed in a mysterious way but failed to grow less anxious till our suspense was cut short by the appearance of the janitor with a message from mr lhommedieu mr lhommedieus compliments said he and he hopes mrs lhommedieu will make herself comfortable and not think of coming down he is doing everything that is necessary and will soon be through you can rest quite easy maam what does he mean marveled the poor woman as the janitor disappeared is he spending all this time ransacking the rooms i wish i dared disobey him i wish i dared go down but her courage was not equal to an open disregard of his wishes and she had to subdue her impatience and wait for a summons that did not come till near two oclock then mr lhommedieu himself appeared with her hat and mantle on his arm my dear said he as she rose haggard with excitement to meet him i have brought your wraps with me that you may go directly from here to our new home shall i assist you to put them on you do not look as well as usual and that is why i have undertaken this thing all myself to save you my dear to save you each and every exertion i had flung out my arms to catch her for i thought she was going to faint but she did not though i think it would have been better for her if she had we are going to leave this house she asked speaking very slowly and with a studied lack of emotion that imposed upon nobody i have said so he smiled the dray has already taken away the half of our effects and the rest will follow at mrs latimers convenience ah i understand she replied with a gasp of relief significant of her fear that by some superhuman cunning he had found the bond she thought so safely concealed i was wondering how mrs latimer came to allow us to leave i tell you they always talked as if i were not present our goods are left as a surety it seems half of our goods he blandly corrected would it interest you to know which half the cunning of this insinuation was matched by the imperturbable shrug with which she replied so a bed has been allowed us and some clothes i am satisfied at which he bit his lips vexed at her selfcontrol and his own failure to break it you have not asked where we are going he observed as with apparent solicitude he threw her mantle over her shoulders the air of lassitude with which she replied bespoke her feeling on that point i have little curiosity she said you know i can be happy anywhere and turning toward me she moved her lips in a way i interpreted to mean go below with me see me out say what you have to say to miss winterburn aloud he dryly suggested i have nothing to say to miss winterburn but thanks was her cold reply belied however by the trembling of her fingers as she essayed to fit on her gloves and those i will receive below i cried with affected gaiety i am going down with you to the door and resolutely ignoring his frown i tripped down before them on the last stair i felt her steps lagging instantly i seemed to comprehend what was required of me and rushing forward i entered the front parlor he followed close behind me for how could he know i was not in collusion with her to regain the bond this gave her one minute by herself in the rear and in that minute she secured the key which would give her future access to the spot where her treasure lay hidden the rest of the story i must give you mainly from hearsay you must understand by this time what mr lhommedieus scheme was in moving thus suddenly he knew that it would be impossible for him by the most minute and continuous watchfulness to prevent his wife from recovering the bond while they continued to inhabit the rooms in which notwithstanding his failure to find it he had reason to believe it still lay concealed but once in other quarters it would be comparatively easy for him to subject her to a surveillance which not only would prevent her from returning to this house without his knowledge but would lead her to give away her secret by the very natural necessity she would be under of going to the exact spot where her treasure lay hid it was a cunning plot and showed him to be as able as he was unscrupulous how it worked i will now proceed to tell you it must have been the next afternoon that the janitor came running up to me i suppose he had learned by this time that i had more than ordinary interest in these people to say that mrs lhommedieu had been in the house and had been so frightened by a man who had followed her that she had fainted dead away on the floor would i go down to her i had rather have gone anywhere else unless it was to prison but duty cannot be shirked and i followed the man down but we were too late mrs lhommedieu had recovered and gone away and the person who had frightened her was also gone and only the hallboy remained to give any explanations this was what he had to say the man it was who went first as soon as the lady fell he skipped out i dont think he meant no good here did she drop here in the hall i asked unable to restrain my intense anxiety oh no maam they was in the back room yonder which she got in somehow the man followed her in sneaking and sneaking like an eel or a cop and she fell right against dont tell me where i cried i dont want to know where and i was about to return upstairs when i heard a quick sharp voice behind me and realized that mr lhommedieu had come in and was having some dispute with the janitor common prudence led me to listen he wanted as was very natural to enter the room where his wife had just been surprised but the janitor alarmed by the foregoing very irregular proceedings was disposed to deny his right to do so the furniture is held as a surety said he and i have orders but mr lhommedieu had a spare dollar and before many minutes had elapsed i heard him go into that room and close the door of the next ten minutes and the suspense i felt i need not speak when he came out again he looked as if the ground would not hold him i have done some mischief i fear he airily said as he passed by the janitor but ill pay for it dont worry ill pay for it and the rent too tomorrow you may tell mrs latimer so and he was gone leaving us all agape in the hallway a minute later we all crept to that room and looked in now that he had got the money i for one was determined to know where she had hid it there was no mistaking the spot a single glance was enough to show us the paper ripped off from a portion of the wall revealing a narrow gap behind the baseboard large enough to hold the bond it was near wait i put in as i remembered where the so called mrs helmuth had pointed just before she died wasnt it at the left of the large folding doors and midway to the wall how came you to know she asked did mrs latimer tell you but as i did not answer she soon took up the thread of her narrative again and sighing softly said the next day came and went but no mr lhommedieu appeared another and i began to grow seriously uneasy a third and a dreadful thing happened late in the afternoon mrs lhommedieu dressed very oddly for her came sliding in at the front door and with an appealing smile at the hallboy who wished but dared not ask her for the key which made these visits possible glided by to her old rooms and finding the door unlocked went softly in her appearance is worth description for it shows the pitiful efforts she made at disguise in the hope i suppose of escaping the surveillance she was evidently conscious of being under she was in the habit of wearing on cool days a black circular with a gray lining this she had turned inside out so that the gray was uppermost while over her neat black bonnet she had flung a long veil also gray which not only hid her face but gave to her appearance an eccentric look as different as possible from her usual aspect the hallboy who had never seen her save in showy black or bright colors said she looked like a ghost in the daytime but it was all done for a purpose i am sure and to escape the attention of the man who had before followed her alas he might have followed her this time without addition to her suffering scarcely had she entered the room where her treasure had been left than she saw the torn paper and gaping baseboard and uttering a cry so piercing it found its way even to the stolid heart of the hallboy she tottered back into the hall where she fell into the arms of her husband who had followed her in from the street in a state of frenzy almost equal to her own the janitor who that minute appeared on the stairway says that he never saw two such faces they looked at each other and were speechless he was the first to hang his head it is gone henry she whispered it is gone you have taken it he did not answer and it is lost you have risked it and it is lost he uttered a groan you should have given it to me that night there was luck in the air then now the devil is in the cards and her arms went up with a shriek my curse be upon you henry lhommedieu and whether it was the look with which she said this that moved him or whether there was some latent love in his heart for this once beautiful and longsuffering woman he shrank at her words and stumbling like a man in the darkness uttered a heartrending groan and rushed from the house we never saw him again as for her she fell this time under a paralytic attack which robbed her of her faculties she was taken to a hospital where i frequently visited her but either from grief or the effect of her attack she did not know me nor did she ever recognize any of us again mrs latimer who is a just woman sold her furniture and after paying herself out of the proceeds gave the remainder to the hospital nurses in charge for mrs lhommedieu so that when she left there she had something with which to start life anew but where she went or how she managed to get along in her enfeebled condition i do not know i never heard of her again then you did not see the woman who died in those rooms i asked the effect of these words was magical and led to mutual explanations she had not seen that woman having encountered all the sorrow she wished to in that room nor was there any one else in the house who would be likely to recognize mrs lhommedieu both the janitor and hallboy being new and mrs latimer one of those proprietors who are only seen on rent day for the rest mrs lhommedieus defective memory which had led her to haunt the house and room where her money had once been hidden accounted not only for her first visit but the last which had ended so fatally the cunning she showed in turning her cloak and flinging a veil over her hat was the cunning of a partially clouded mind it was a reminiscence of the morning when her terrible misfortune occurred my habit of taking the key out of the lock of that unused door made the use of her own key possible and her fear of being followed caused her to lock the door behind her my wife who must have fallen into a doze on my leaving her did not see her enter but detected her just as she was trying to escape through the folding doors my presence in the parlor probably added to her embarrassment and she fled turning her cloak as she did so how simple it seemed now that we knew the facts but how obscure and to all appearance unexplainable before the clew was given to the mystery
