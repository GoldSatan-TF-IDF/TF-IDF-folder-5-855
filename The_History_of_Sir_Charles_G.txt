byron to miss selby o my lucy what think you but it is easy to guess what you must think i will without saying one word more enclose dr bartletts tenth letter the next day proceeds my patron i went to make my visit to the family i had nothing to reproach myself with and therefore had no other concern upon me but what arose from the unhappiness of the noble clementina that indeed was enough i thought i should have some difficulty to manage my own spirit if i were to find myself insulted especially by the general soldiers are so apt to value themselves on their knowledge of what after all one may call but their trade that a private gentleman is often thought too slightly of by them insolence in a great man a rich man or a soldier is a call upon a man of spirit to exert himself but i hope thought i i shall not have this call from any one of a family i so greatly respect i was received by the bishop who politely after i had paid my compliments to the marquis and his lady presented me to those of the urbino family to whom i was a stranger every one of those named by signor jeronymo in his last letter was present the marquis after he had returned my compliment looked another way to hide his emotion the marchioness put her handkerchief to her eyes and looked upon me with tenderness and i read in them her concern for her clementina i paid my respects to the general with an air of freedom yet of regard to my jeronymo with the tenderness due to our friendship and congratulated him on seeing him out of his chamber his kind eyes glistened with pleasure yet it was easy to read a mixture of pain in them which grew stronger as the first emotions at seeing me enter gave way to reflection the conte della porretta seemed to measure me with his eye i addressed myself to father marescotti and made my particular acknowledgments to him for the favour of his visit and what had passed in it he looked upon me with pleasure probably with the more as this was a farewell visit the two ladies whispered and looked upon me and seemed to bespeak each others attention to what passed signor sebastiano placed himself next to jeronymo and often whispered him and as often cast his eye upon me he was partial to me i believe because my generous friend seemed pleased with what he said his brother signor juliano sat on the other hand of me they are agreeable and polite young gentlemen a profound silence succeeded the general compliments i addressed myself to the marquis your lordship and you madam turning to the marchioness i hope will excuse me for having requested of you the honour of being once more admitted to your presence and to that of three brothers for whom i shall ever retain the most respectful affection i could not think of leaving a city where one of the first families in it has done me the highest honour without taking such a leave as might shew my gratitude accept my lords bowing to each accept madam more profoundly bowing to the marchioness my respectful thanks for all your goodness to me i shall to the end of my life number most of the days that i have passed at bologna among its happiest even were the remainder to be as happy as man ever knew the marquis said we wish you chevalier very happy happier than he sighed and was silent his lady only bowed her face spoke distress her voice was lost in sighs though she struggled to suppress them chevalier said the bishop with an air of solemnity you have given us many happy hours for them we thank you jeronymo for himself will say more he is the most grateful of men we thank you also for what you have done for him i cannot said jeronymo express suitably my gratitude my prayers my vows shall follow you whithersoever you go best of friends and best of men the general with an air and a smile that might have been dispensed with oddly said high pleasure and high pain are very near neighbours they are often guilty of excesses and then are apt to mistake each others house i am one of those who think our whole house obliged to the chevalier for the seasonable assistance he gave to our jeronymo but dear general said lady juliana bear with an interruption the intent of this meeting is amicable the chevalier is a man of honour things may have fallen out unhappily yet nobody to blame as to blame or otherwise said the conte della porretta that is not now to be talked of else i know where it lies in short among ourselves the chevalier acted greatly by signor jeronymo we were all obliged to him but to let such a man as this have free admission to our daughter she ought to have had no eyes pray my lord pray brother said the marquis are we not enough sufferers the chevalier said the general cannot but be gratified by so high a compliment and smiled indignantly my lord replied i to the general you know very little of the man before you if you dont believe him to be the most afflicted man present impossible said the marquis with a sigh the marchioness arose from her seat motioning to go and turning round to the two ladies and the count i have resigned my will to the will of you all my dearest friends and shall be permitted to withdraw this testimony however before i go i cannot but bear wherever the fault lay it lay not with the chevalier he has from the first to the last acted with the nicest honour he is entitled to our respect the unhappiness lies nowhere but in the difference of religion well and that now is absolutely out of the question said the general it is indeed chevalier i hope my lord from a descendant of a family so illustrious to find an equal exemption from wounding words and wounding looks and that sir as well from your generosity as from your justice my looks give you offence chevalier do they i attended to the marchioness she came towards me i arose and respectfully took her hand chevalier said she i could not withdraw without bearing the testimony i have borne to your merits i wish you happy god protect you whithersoever you go adieu she wept i bowed on her hand with profound respect she retired with precipitation it was with difficulty that i suppressed the rising tear i took my seat i made no answer to the generals last question though it was spoken in such a way i saw by their eyes as took every other persons notice lady sforza when her sister was retired hinted that the last interview between the young lady and me was an unadvised permission though intended for the best i then took upon me to defend that step lady clementina said i had declared that if she were allowed to speak her whole mind to me she should be easy i had for some time given myself up to absolute despair the marchioness intended not favour to me in allowing of the interview it was the most affecting one to me i had ever known but let me say that far from having bad effects on the young ladys mind it had good ones i hardly knew how to talk upon a subject so very interesting to every one present but not more so to any one than to myself i thought of avoiding it and have been led into it but did not lead and since it is before us let me recommend as the most effectual way to restore every one to peace and happiness gentle treatment the most generous of human minds the most meek the most dutiful requires not harsh methods how do you know sir said the general and looked at jeronymo the methods now taken and are they then harsh my lord said i he was offended i had heard proceeded i that a change of measures was resolved on i knew that the treatment before had been all gentle condescending indulgent i received but yesterday letters from my father signifying his intention of speedily recalling me to my native country i shall set out very soon for paris where i hope to meet with his more direct commands for this longdesired end what may be my destiny i know not but i shall carry with me a heart burdened with the woes of this family and distressed for the beloved daughter of it but let me bespeak you all for your own sakes mine is out of the question i presume not upon any hope on my own account that you will treat this angelicminded lady with tenderness i pretend to say that i know that harsh or severe methods will not do the general arose from his seat and with a countenance of fervor next to fierceness let me tell you grandison said he i arose from mine and going to lady sforza who sat next him he stopt supposing me going to him and seemed surprised and attentive to my motions but disregarding him i addressed myself to that lady you madam are the aunt of lady clementina the tender the indulgent mother is absent and has declared that she resigns her will to the will of her friends present allow me to supplicate that former measures may not be changed with her great dawnings of returning reason did i discover in our last interview her delicacy never was there a more delicate mind wanted but to be satisfied it was satisfied and she began to be easy were her mind but once composed the sense she has of her duty and what she owes to her religion would restore her to your wishes but if she should be treated harshly though i am sure if she should it would be with the best intention clementina will be lost the general sat down they all looked upon one another the two ladies dried their eyes the starting tear would accompany my fervor and then stepping to jeronymo who was extremely affected my dear jeronymo said i my friend my beloved friend cherish in your noble heart the memory of your grandison would to god i could attend you to england we have baths there of sovereign efficacy the balm of a friendly and grateful heart would promote the cure i have urged it before consider of it my grandison my dear grandison my friend my preserver you are not going i am my jeronymo and embraced him love me in absence as i shall you chevalier said the bishop you dont go we hope for your company at a small collation we must not part with you yet i cannot my lord accept the favour although i had given myself up to despair of obtaining the happiness to which i once aspired yet i was not willing to quit a city that this family had made dear to me with the precipitation of a man conscious of misbehaviour i thank you for the permission i had to attend you all in full assembly may god prosper you my lord and may you be invested with the first honours of that church which must be adorned by so worthy a heart it will be my glory when i am in my native place or wherever i am to remember that i was once thought not unworthy of a rank in a family so respectable let me my lord be entitled to your kind remembrance he pulled out his handkerchief my lord said he to his father my lord to the general grandison must not go and sat down with emotion lady sforza wept laurana seemed moved the two young lords sebastiano and juliano were greatly affected i then addressed myself to the marquis who sat undetermined as to speech my venerable lord forgive me that my address was not first paid here my heart overflows with gratitude for your goodness in permitting me to throw myself at your feet before i took a last farewell of a city favoured with your residence best of fathers of friends of men let me entreat the continuance of your paternal indulgence to the child nearest and deserving to be nearest to your heart she is all you and her mother restore her to yourself and to her by your indulgence that alone and a blessing on your prayers can restore her adieu my good lord repeated thanks for all your hospitable goodness to a man that will ever retain a grateful sense of your favour you will not yet go was all he said he seemed in agitation he could not say more i then turning to the count his brother who sat next him said i have not the honour to be fully known to your lordship some prejudices from differences in opinion may have been conceived but if you ever hear anything of the man before you unworthy of his name and of the favour once designed him then my lord blame as well as wonder at the condescension of your noble brother and sister in my favour who i who i said that lord in some hurry i think very well of you i never saw a man in my life that i liked so well your lordship does me honour i say this the rather as i may on this solemn occasion taking leave of such honourable friends charge my future life with resolutions to behave worthy of the favour i have met with in this family i passed from him to the general forgive my lord said i the seeming formality of my behaviour in this parting scene it is a very solemn one to me you have expressed yourself of me and to me my lord with more passion forgive me i mean not to offend you than perhaps you will approve in yourself when i am far removed from italy for have you not a noble mind and are you not a son of the marquis della porretta permit me to observe that passion will make a man exalt himself and degrade another and the just medium will be then forgot i am afraid i have been thought more lightly of than i ought to be either in justice or for the honour of a person who is dear to every one present my country was once mentioned with disdain think not my vanity so much concerned in what i am going to say as my honour i am proud to be thought an englishman yet i think as highly of every worthy man of every nation under the sun as i do of the worthy men of my own i am not of a contemptible race in my own country my father lives in it with the magnificence of a prince he loves his son yet i presume to add that that son deems his good name his riches his integrity his grandeur princes though they are entitled by their rank to respect are princes to him only as they act a few words more my lord i have been of the hearing not of the speaking side of the question in the two last conferences i had the honour to hold with your lordship once you unkindly mentioned the word triumph the word at the time went to my heart when i can subdue the natural warmth of my temper then and then only i have a triumph i should not have remembered this had i not now my lord on this solemn occasion been received by you with an indignant eye i respect your lordship too much not to take notice of this angry reception my silence upon it perhaps would look like subscribing before this illustrious company to the justice of your contempt yet i mean no other notice than this and this to demonstrate that i was not in my own opinion at least absolutely unworthy of the favour i met with from the father the mother the brothers you so justly honour and which i wished to stand in with you and now my lord allow me the honour of your hand and as i have given you no cause for displeasure say that you will remember me with kindness as i shall honour you and your whole family to the last day of my life the general heard me out but it was with great emotion he accepted not my hand he returned not any answer the bishop arose and taking him aside endeavoured to calm him i addressed myself to the two young lords and said that if ever their curiosity led them to visit england where i hoped to be in a few months i should be extremely glad of cultivating their esteem and favour by the best offices i could do them they received my civility with politeness i addressed myself next to lady laurana may you madam the friend the intimate the chosen companion of lady clementina never know the hundredth part of the woe that fills the breast of the man before you for the calamity that has befallen your admirable cousin and because of that a whole excellent family let me recommend to you that tender and soothing treatment to her which her tender heart would shew to you in any calamity that should befall you i am not a bad man madam though of a different communion from yours think but half so charitably of me as i do of every one of your religion who lives up to his professions and i shall be happy in your favourable thoughts when you hear me spoken of it is easy to imagine dr bartlett that i addressed myself in this manner to this lady whom i had never before seen that she might not think the harder of her cousins prepossessions in favour of a protestant i recommended myself to the favour of father marescotti he assured me of his esteem in very warm terms and just as i was again applying to my jeronymo the general came to me you cannot think sir said he nor did you design it i suppose that i should be pleased with your address to me i have only this question to ask when do you quit bologna let me ask your lordship said i when do you return to naples why that question sir haughtily i will answer you frankly your lordship at the first of my acquaintance with you invited me to naples i promised to pay my respects to you there if you think of being there in a week i will attend you at your own palace in that city and there my lord i hope no cause to the contrary having arisen from me to be received by you with the same kindness and favour that you shewed when you gave me the invitation i think to leave bologna tomorrow o brother said the bishop are you not now overcome and are you in earnest said the general i am my lord i have many valuable friends at different courts and cities in italy to take leave of i never intend to see it again i would look upon your lordship as one of those friends but you seem still displeased with me you accepted not my offered hand before once more i tender it a man of spirit cannot be offended at a man of spirit without lessening himself i call upon your dignity my lord he held out his hand just as i was withdrawing mine i have pride you know dr bartlett and i was conscious of a superiority in this instance i took his hand however at his offer yet pitied him that his motion was made at all as it wanted that grace which generally accompanies all he does and says the bishop embraced me your moderation thus exerted said he must ever make you triumph o grandison you are a prince of the almightys creation the noble jeronymo dried his eyes and held out his arms to embrace me the general said i shall certainly be at naples in a week i am too much affected by the woes of my family to behave as perhaps i ought on this occasion indeed grandison it is difficult for sufferers to act with spirit and temper at the same time it is my lord i have found it so my hopes raised as once they were now sunk and absolute despair having taken place of them would to god i had never returned to italy but i reproach not any body yet said jeronymo you have some reason to be sent for as you were he was going on pray brother said the general and turning to me i may expect you sir at naples you may my lord but one favour i have to beg of you mean time it is that you will not treat harshly your dear clementina would to heaven i might have had the honour to say my clementina and permit me to make one other request on my own account and that is that you will tell her that i took my leave of your whole family by their kind permission and that at my departure i wished her from my soul all the happiness that the best and tenderest of her friends can wish her i make this request to you my lord rather than to signor jeronymo because the tenderness which he has for me might induce him to mention me to her in a manner which might at this time affect her too sensibly for her peace be pleased my dear signor jeronymo to make my devotion known to the marchioness would to heaven but adieu and once more adieu my jeronymo i shall hear from you when i get to naples if not before god restore your sister and heal you i bowed to the marquis to the ladies to the general to the bishop particularly to the rest in general and was obliged in order to conceal my emotion to hurry out at the door the servants had planted themselves in a row not for selfish motives as in england they bowed to the ground and blessed me as i went through them i had ready a purse of ducats one hand and another declined it i dropt it in their sight god be with you my honest friends said i and departed o dr bartlett with a heart how much distressed and now my good miss byron have i not reason from the deep concern which you take in the woes of lady clementina to regret the task you have put me upon and do you my good lord and lady l and miss grandison now wonder that your brother has not been forward to give you the particulars of this melancholy tale yet you all say i must proceed see lucy the greatness of this mans behaviour what a presumption was it in your harriet ever to aspire to call such a one hers letter ii miss byron to miss selby this lady olivia lucy what can she pretend to but i will not puzzle myself about her yet she pretend to give disturbance to such a man you will find her mentioned in dr bartletts next letter or she would not have been named by me dr bartletts eleventh letter mr grandison on his return to his lodgings found there in disguise lady olivia he wanted not any new disturbance but i will not mix the stories the next morning he received a letter from signor jeronymo the following is a translation of it my dearest grandison how do you ever amiable friend what triumphs did your behaviour of last night obtain for you not a soul here but admires you even laurana declared that were you a catholic it would be a merit to love you yet she reluctantly praised you and once said what but splendid sins are the virtues of a heretic our two cousins with the goodnature of youth lamented that you could not be ours in the way you wish my father wept like a child when you were gone and seemed to enjoy the praises given you by every one the count said he never saw a nobler behaviour in man your free your manly your polite air and address and your calmness and intrepidity were applauded by every one what joy did this give to your jeronymo i thought i wanted neither crutches helps nor wheeled chair and several times forgot that i ailed any thing i begin to love father marescotti he was with the foremost in praising you the general owned that he was resolved once to quarrel with you but will he do you think jeronymo said he make me a visit at naples you may depend upon it he will answered i i will be there to receive him replied he they admired you particularly for your address to my sister by the general rather than by me and lady sforza said it was a thousand pities that you and clementina could not be one they applauded all of them what they had not any of them the power to imitate that largeness of heart which makes you think so well and speak so tenderly of those of communions different from your own so much steadiness in your own religion yet so much prudence in a man so young they said was astonishing no wonder that your character ran so high in every court you had visited my mother came in soon after you had left us she was equally surprised and grieved to find you gone she thought she was sure of your staying supper and not satisfied with the slight leave she had taken she had been strengthening her mind to pass an hour in your company in order to take a more solemn one my father asked her after her daughter poor soul said she she has heard that the chevalier was to be here to take leave of us by whom by whom said my father i cannot tell but the poor creature is halfraving to be admitted among us she has dressed herself in one of her best suits and i found her sitting in a kind of form expecting to be called down indeed lady sforza the method we are in does not do so the chevalier said replied that lady well let us change it with all my heart it is no pleasure to treat the dear girl harshly o sister this is a most extraordinary man that moment in bolted camilla lady clementina is just at the door i could not prevail upon her we all looked upon one another three soft taps at the door and a hem let us know she was there let her come in dear girl let her come in said the count the chevalier is not here laurana arose and ran to the door and led her in by the hand dear creature how wild she looked tears ran down my cheeks i had not seen her for two days before o how earnestly did she look round her withdrawing her hand from her cousin who would have led her to a chair and standing quite still come and sit by me my sweet love said her weeping mother she stept towards her sit down my dear girl no you beat me remember who beat you my dear sure nobody would beat my child who beat you clementina i dont know still looking round her as wanting somebody again her mother courted her to sit down no madam you dont love me indeed my dear i do so you say her father held out his open arms to her tears ran down his cheeks he could not speak ah my father said she stepping towards him he caught her in his arms dont dont sir faintly struggling with averted face you love me not you refused to see your child when she wanted to claim your protection i was used cruelly by whom my dear by whom by every body i complained to one and to another but all were in a tone and so i thought i would be contented my mamma too but it is no matter i saw it was to be so and i did not care by my soul said i this is not the way with her lady sforza the chevalier is in the right you see how sensible she is of harsh treatment well well said the general let us change our measures still the dear girl looked out earnestly as for somebody she loosed herself from the arms of her sorrowing father let us in silence said the count observe her motions she went to him on tiptoe and looking in his face over his shoulder as he sat with his back towards her passed him then to the general then to signor sebastiano and to every one round till she came to me looking at each over his shoulder in the same manner then folding her fingers her hands open and her arms hanging down to their full extent she held up her face meditating with such a significant woe that i thought my heart would have burst not a soul in the company had a dry eye lady sforza arose took her two hands the fingers still clasped and would have spoken to her but could not and hastily retired to her seat tears at last began to trickle down her cheeks as she stood fixedly looking up she started looked about her and hastening to her mother threw her arms about her neck and hiding her face in her bosom broke out into a flood of tears mingled with sobs that penetrated every heart the first words she said were love me my mamma love your child your poor child your clementina then raising her head and again laying it in her mothers bosom if ever you loved me love me now my mamma i have need of your love my father was forced to withdraw he was led out by his two sons your poor jeronymo was unable to help himself he wanted as much comfort as his father what were the wounds of his body at that time to those of his mind my two brothers returned this dear girl said the bishop will break all our hearts her tears had seemed to relieve her she held up her head my mothers bosom seemed wet with her childs tears and her own still she looked round her suppose said i somebody were to name the man she seems to look for it may divert this wildness did she come down said laurana to camilla with the expectation of seeing him she did let me said the bishop speak to her he arose and taking her hand walked with her about the room you look pretty my clementina your ornaments are charmingly fancied what made you dress yourself so prettily she looked earnestly at him in silence he repeated his question i speak said she all my heart and then i suffer for it every body is against me you shall not suffer for it every body is for you i confessed to mrs beaumont i confessed to you brother but what did i get by it let go my hand i dont love you i believe i am sorry for it i love you clementina as i love my own soul yet you never chide your own soul he turned his face from her to us she must not be treated harshly said he he soothed her in a truly brotherly manner tell me added he to his soothings did you expect any body here that you find not did i yes i did camilla come hither let go my hand brother he did she took camilla under the arm dont you know camilla said she what you heard said of somebodys threatening somebody dont let anybody hear us drawing her to one end of the room i want to take a walk with you into the garden camilla it is dark night madam no matter if you are afraid i will go by myself seem to humour her in talk camilla said the count but dont go out of the room with her be pleased to tell me madam what we are to walk in the garden for why camilla i had a horrid dream last night and i cannot be easy till i go into the garden what madam was your dream in the orange grove i thought i stumbled over the body of a dead man and who was it madam dont you know who was threatened and was not somebody here to night and was not somebody to sup here and is he here the general then went to her my dearest clementina my beloved sister set your heart at rest somebody is safe shall be safe she took first one of his hands then the other and looking in the palms of them they are not bloody said she what have you done with him then where is he where is who you know whom i ask after but you want something against me then stepping quick up to me my jeronymo did i see you before and stroked my cheek now tell me jeronymo dont come near me camilla pray sir to the general do you sit down she leaned her arm upon my shoulder i dont hurt you jeronymo do i no my dearest clementina thats my best brother cruel assassins but the brave man came just in time to save you but do you know what is become of him he is safe my dear he could not stay did any body affront him no my love are you sure nobody did very sure father marescotti said she turning to him who wept from the time she entered you dont love him but you are a good man and will tell me truth where is he did nobody affront him no madam because said she he never did any thing but good to any one father marescotti said i admires him as much as any body admire him father marescotti admire him but he does not love him and i never heard him say one word against father marescotti in my life well but jeronymo what made him go away then was he not to stay supper he was desired to stay but would not jeronymo let me whisper you did he tell you that i wrote him a letter i guessed you did whispered i you are a strange guesser but you cant guess how i sent it to him but hush jeronymo well but jeronymo did he say nothing of me when he went away he left his compliments for you with the general with the general the general wont tell me yes he will brother pray tell my sister what the chevalier said to you at parting he repeated exactly what you had desired him to say to her why would they not let me see him said she am i never to see him more i hope you will replied the bishop if resumed she we could have done any thing that might have looked like a return to his goodness to us and to you my jeronymo in particular i believe i should have been easy and so you say he is gone and gone for ever lifting up her hand from her wrist as it lay over my shoulder poor chevalier but hush hush pray hush jeronymo she went from me to her aunt and cousin laurana love me again madam said she to the former you loved me once i never loved you better than now my dear did you laurana see the chevalier grandison i did and did he go away safe and unhurt indeed he did a man who had preserved the life of our dear jeronymo said she to have been hurt by us would have been dreadful you know i wanted to say a few words to him i was astonished to find him not here and then my dream came into my head it was a sad dream indeed but cousin be good to me pray do you did not use to be cruel you used to say you loved me i am in calamity my dear i know i am miserable at times i know i am and then i am grieved at my heart and think how happy every one is but me but then again i ail nothing and am well but do love me laurana i am in calamity my dear i would love you if you were in calamity indeed i would ah laurana what is become of all your fine promises but then every body loved me and i was happy yet you tell me it is all for my good naughty laurana to wound my heart by your crossness and then say it is for my good do you think i should have served you so laurana blushed and wept her aunt promised her that every body would love her and comfort her and not be angry with her if she would make her heart easy i am very particular my dear grandison i know you love i should be so from this minuteness you will judge of the workings of her mind they are resolved to take your advice it was very seasonable and treat her with indulgence the count is earnest to have it so camilla has just left me she says that her young lady had a tolerable night she thinks it owing in a great measure to her being indulged in asking the servants who saw you depart how you looked and being satisfied that you went away unhurt and unaffronted adieu my dearest my best friend let me hear from you as often as you can i just now understand from camilla that the dear girl has made an earnest request to my father mother and aunt and been refused she came back from them deeply afflicted and as camilla fears is going into one of her gloomy fits again i hope to write again if you depart not from bologna before tomorrow but i must for my own sake write shorter letters yet how can i since however melancholy the subject when i am writing to you i am conversing with you my dear grandison once more adieu o lucy my dear whence come all the tears this melancholy story has cost me i cannot dwell upon the scenes begone all those wishes that would interfere with the interest of that sweet distressed saint at bologna how impolitic lucy was it in them not to gratify her impatience to see him she would most probably have been quieted in her mind if she had been obliged by one other interview what a delicacy my dear what a generosity is there in her love sir charles in lord ls study said to me that his compassion was engaged but his honour was free and so it seems to be but a generosity in return for her generosity must bind such a mind as his letter iii miss byron to miss selby in the doctors next letter enclosed you will find mention made of sir charless literary journal i fancy my dear it must be a charming thing i wish we could have before us every line he wrote while he was in italy once the presumptuous harriet had hopes that she might have been entitled but no more of these hopes it cant be helped lucy dr bartletts twelfth letter mr grandison proceeds thus the next morning i employed myself in visiting and taking leave of several worthy members of the university with whom i had passed many very agreeable and improving hours during my residence in this noble city in my literary journal you have an account of those worthy persons and of some of our conversations i paid my duty to the cardinal legate and the gonfaloniere and to three of his counsellors by whom you know i had been likewise greatly honoured my mind was not free enough to enjoy their conversation such a weight upon my heart how could it but the debt of gratitude and civility was not to be left unpaid on my return to my lodgings which was not till the evening i found the general had been there to inquire after me i sent one of my servants to the palace of porretta with my compliments to the general to the bishop and jeronymo and with particular inquiries after the health of the ladies and the marquis but had only a general answer that they were much as i left them the two young lords sebastiano and juliano made me a visit of ceremony they talked of visiting england in a year or two i assured them of my best services and urged them to go thither i asked them after the healths of the marquis the marchioness and their beloved cousin clementina signor sebastiano shook his head very very indifferent were his words we parted with great civilities i will now turn my thoughts to florence and to the affairs there that have lain upon me from the death of my good friend mr jervois and from my wardship i told you in their course the steps i took in those affairs and how happy i had been in some parts of management there i hope soon to see you my dear dr bartlett from the levant to whose care i can so safely consign my precious trust while i go to paris and attend the wishedfor call of my father to my native country from which i have been for so many years an exile there also i hope to have some opportunities of conversing with my good mrs beaumont resolving to make another effort to get so valuable a person to restore herself to my beloved england thus my dear dr bartlett do i endeavour to console myself in order to lighten that load of grief which i labour under on the distresses of the dear clementina if i can leave her happy i shall be sooner so than i could have been in the same circumstances had i from the first of my acquaintance with the family to the breach of all the laws of hospitality indulged a passion for her yet is the unhappy olivia a damp upon my endeavours after consolation when she made her unseasonable visit to me at bologna she refused to return to florence without me till i assured her that as my affairs would soon call me thither i would visit her at her own palace as often as those affairs would permit her pretence for coming to bologna was to induce me to place emily with her till i had settled every thing for my carrying the child to england but i was obliged to be peremptory in my denial though she had wrought so with emily as to induce her to be an earnest petitioner to me to permit her to live with lady olivia whose equipages and the glare in which she lives had dazzled the eyes of the young lady i was impatient to hear again from jeronymo and just as i was setting out for florence in despair of that favour it being the second day after my farewell visit i had the following letter from him i have not been well my dear grandison i am afraid the wound in my shoulder must be laid open again god give me patience but my life is a burden to me we are driving here at a strange rate they promised to keep measures with the dear creature but she has heard that you are leaving bologna and raves to see you poor soul she endeavoured to prevail upon her father mother aunt to permit her to see you but for five minutes that was the petition which was denied her as i mentioned in my last camilla was afraid that she would go into a gloomy fit upon it as i told you she did but it lasted not long for she made an effort soon after to go out of the house by way of the garden the gardener refused his key and brought camilla to her whom she had by an innocent piece of art but just before sent to bring her something from her toilette the general went with camilla to her they found her just setting a ladder against the wall she heard them and screamed and leaving the ladder ran to avoid them till she came in sight of the great cascade into which had she not by a cross alley been intercepted by the general it is feared she would have thrown herself this has terrified us all she begs but for one interview one parting interview and she promises to make herself easy but it is not thought advisable yet father marescotti himself thought it best to indulge her had my mother been earnest i believe it had been granted but she is so much concerned at the blame she met with on permitting the last interview that she will not contend though she has let them know that she did not oppose the request the unhappy girl ran into my chamber this morning jeronymo he will be gone said she i know he will all i want is but to see him to wish him happy and to know if he will remember me when he is gone as i shall him have you no interest jeronymo cannot i once see him not once the bishop before i could answer came in quest of her followed by laurana from whom she had forcibly disengaged herself to come to me let me have but one parting interview my lord said she looking to him and clinging about my neck he will be gone gone for ever is there so much in being allowed to say farewell and be happy grandison and excuse all the trouble i have given you what has my brothers preserver done what have i done that i must not see him nor he me for one quarter of an hour only indeed my lord said i she should be complied with indeed she should my father thinks otherwise said the bishop the count thinks otherwise i think otherwise were the chevalier a common man she might but she dwells upon what passed in the last interview and his behaviour to her that it is plain did her harm the next may drive the thoughts of that out of her head returned i dear jeronymo replied he a little peevishly you will always think differently from every body else mrs beaumont comes tomorrow what do i care for mrs beaumont said she i dont love her she tells every thing i say come my dear love said laurana you afflict your brother jeronymo let us go up to your own chamber i afflict every body and every body afflicts me and you are all cruel why he will be gone i tell you that makes me so impatient and i have something to say to him my father wont see me my mother renounces me i have been looking for her and she hides herself from me and i am a prisoner and watched and used ill here comes my mother said laurana you now must go up to your chamber cousin clementina so she does said she now i must go indeed ah jeronymo now there is no saying nay but it is hard very hard and she burst into tears i wont speak though said she to my aunt remember i will be silent madam then whispering me my aunt brother is not the aunt she used to be to me but hush i dont complain you know by this i saw that lady sforza was severe with her she addressed herself to her aunt you are not my mamma are you madam no child no child indeed i know that too well but my brother giacomo is as cruel to me as any body but hush jeronymo dont you betray me now my aunt is come i must go i wish i could run away from you all she was yesterday detected writing a letter to you my mother was shewn what she had written and wept over it my aunt took it out of my sisters bosom where she had thrust it on her coming in this she resented highly when she was led into her own chamber she refused to speak but in great hurry went to her closet and taking down her bible turned over one leaf and another very quick lady sforza had a book in her hand and sat overagainst the closetdoor to observe her motions she came to a place pretty said she the bishop had formerly given her a smattering of latin she took pen and ink and wrote youll see chevalier the very great purity of her thoughts by what she omitted and what she chose from the canticles velut unguentum diffunditur nomen tuum c in the english translation thus thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee draw me we will run after thee the upright love thee look not upon me because i am black because the sun hath looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions she laid down her pen and was thoughtful her elbow resting on the escritoire she wrote upon her hand supporting her head may i look over you my dear said her aunt stepping to her and taking up the paper read it and took it out of the closet with her unopposed her gentle bosom only heaving sighs i will write no more so minutely on this affecting subject my grandison they are all of opinion that she will be easy when she knows that you have actually left bologna and they strengthen their opinion by these words of hers aboverecited why he will be gone i tell you and this makes me so impatient at least they are resolved to try the experiment and so my dear grandison you must be permitted to leave us god be your director and comforter as well as ours prays your ever affectionate jeronymo mr grandison having no hopes of being allowed to see the unhappy lady set out with a heavy heart for florence he gave orders there and at leghorn that the clerks and agents of his late friend mr jervois should prepare every thing for his inspection against his return from naples and then he set out for that city to attend the general he had other friends to whom he had endeared himself at sienna ancona and particularly at rome as he had also some at naples of whom he intended to take leave before he set out for paris and therefore went to attend the general with the greater pleasure within the appointed time he arrived at naples the general received me said mr grandison with greater tokens of politeness than affection you are the happiest man in the world chevalier said he after the first compliments in escaping dangers by braving them i do assure you that i had great difficulties to deny myself the favour of paying you a visit in my own way at bologna i had indeed resolved to do it till you proposed this visit to me here i should have been very sorry replied i to have seen a brother of lady clementina in any way that should not have made me consider him as her brother but before i say another word let me ask after her health how does the most excellent of women you have not heard then i have not my lord but it is not for want of solicitude i have sent three several messengers but can hear nothing to my satisfaction nor can you hear any thing from me that will give you any i am grieved at my soul that i cannot how my lord do the marquis and marchioness dont ask they are extremely unhappy i hear that my dear friend signor jeronymo has undergone a dreadful operation interrupted the general he has poor jeronymo he could not write to you god preserve my brother but chevalier you did not save half a life though we thank you for that when you restored him to our arms i had no reason to boast my lord of the accident i never made a merit of it it was a mere accident and cost me nothing the service was greatly overrated would to god chevalier it had been rendered by any other man in the world as it has proved i am sure my lord i have reason to join in the wish he shewed me his pictures statues and cabinet of curiosities while dinner was preparing but rather for the ostentation of his magnificence and taste than to do me pleasure i even observed an increasing coldness in his behaviour and his eye was too often cast upon me with a fierceness that shewed resentment and not with the hospitable frankness that became him to a visitor and guest who had undertaken a journey of above two hundred miles principally to attend him and to shew him the confidence he had in his honour this as it was more to his dishonour than mine i pitied him for but what most of all disturbed me was that i could not obtain from him any particular intelligence relating to the health of one person whose distresses lay heavy upon my heart there were several persons of distinction at dinner the discourse could therefore be only general he paid me great respect at his table but it was a solemn one i was the more uneasy at it as i apprehended that the situation of the bologna family was more unhappy than when i left that city he retired with me into his garden you stay with me at least the week out chevalier no my lord i have affairs of a deceased friend at florence and at leghorn to settle tomorrow as early as i can i shall set out for rome in my way to tuscany i am surprised chevalier you take something amiss in my behaviour i cannot say that your lordships countenance i am a very free speaker has that benignity in it that complacency which i have had the pleasure to see in it by g chevalier i could have loved you better than any man in the world next to the men of my own family but i own i see you not here with so much love as admiration the word admiration my lord may require explanation you may admire at my confidence but i thank you for the manly freedom of your acknowledgment in general by admiration i mean all that may do you honour your bravery in coming hither particularly and your greatness of mind on your taking leave of us all but did you not then mean to insult me i meant to observe to you then as i now do in your own palace that you had not treated me as my heart told me i deserved to be treated but when i thought your warmth was rising to the uneasiness of your assembled friends instead of answering your question about my stay at bologna as you seemed to mean it i invited myself to an attendance upon you here at naples in such a manner as surely could not be construed as insult i own grandison you disconcerted me i had intended to save you that journey was that your lordships meaning when in my absence you called at my lodgings the day after the farewellvisit not absolutely i was uneasy with myself i intended to talk to you what that talk might have produced i know not but had i invited you out if i had found you at home would you have answered my demands according as you had put them will you answer them now if i attend you as far as rome on your return to florence if they are demands fit to be answered do you expect i will make any that are not fit to be answered my lord i will explain myself you had conceived causeless prejudices against me you seemed inclined to impute to me a misfortune that was not could not be greater to you than it was to me i knew my own innocence i knew that i was rather an injured man in having hopes given me in which i was disappointed not by my own fault whom shall an innocent and an injured man fear had i feared my fear might have been my destruction for was i not in the midst of your friends a foreigner if i would have avoided you could i had you been determined to seek me i would choose to meet even an enemy as a man of honour rather than to avoid him as a malefactor in my country the law supposes flight a confession of guilt had you made demands upon me that i had not chosen to answer i would have expostulated with you i could perhaps have done so as calmly as i now speak if you would not have been expostulated with i would have stood upon my defence but for the world i would not have hurt a brother of clementina and jeronymo a son of the marquis and marchioness of porretta could i have avoided it had your passion given me any advantage over you and i had obtained your sword a pistol had the choice been left to me i had refused for both our sakes i would have presented both swords to you and bared my breast it was before penetrated by the distresses of the dear clementina and of all your family perhaps i should only have said if your lordship thinks i have injured you take your revenge and now that i am at naples let me say that if you are determined contrary to all my hopes to accompany me to rome or elsewhere on my return with an unfriendly purpose such and no other shall be my behaviour to you if the power be given me to shew it i will rely on my own innocence and hope by generosity to overcome a generous man let the guilty secure themselves by violence and murder superlative pride angrily said he and stood still measuring me with his eye and could you hope for such an advantage while i my lord was calm and determined only upon selfdefence while you were passionate and perhaps rash as aggressors generally are i did not doubt it but could i have avoided drawing and preserved your good opinion i would not have drawn your lordship cannot but know my principles grandison i do know them and also the general report in your favour for skill and courage do you think i would have heard with patience of the once proposed alliance had not your character and then he was pleased to say many things in my favour from the report of persons who had weight with him some of whom he named but still grandison said he this poor girl she could not have been so deeply affected had not some loverlike arts let me my lord interrupt you i cannot bear an imputation of this kind had such arts been used the lady could not have been so much affected cannot you think of your noble sister as a daughter of the two houses from which you sprang cannot you see her as by mrs beaumonts means we now so lately have been able to see her struggling nobly with her own heart why am i put upon this tender subject because of her duty and her religion and resolved to die rather than encourage a wish that was not warranted by both i cannot my lord urge this subject but there never was a passion so nobly contended with there never was a man more disinterested and so circumstanced remember only my voluntary departure from bologna against persuasion and the great behaviour of your sister on that occasion great as it came out to be when mrs beaumont brought her to acknowledge what would have been my glory to have known could it have been encouraged but is now made my heaviest concern indeed grandison she ever was a noble girl we are too apt perhaps to govern ourselves by events without looking into causes but the access you had to her such a man and who became known to us from circumstances so much in his favour both as a man of principle and bravery this my lord interrupted i is still judging from events you have seen mrs beaumonts letter surely you cannot have a nobler monument of magnanimity in woman and to that i refer for a proof of my own integrity i have that letter jeronymo gave it me at my taking leave of him and with these words grandison will certainly visit you at naples i am afraid of your warmth his spirit is well known all my dependance is upon his principles he will not draw but in his own defence cherish the noble visitor surely brother i may depend upon your hospitable temper read over again this letter before you see him i have not yet read it proceeded the general but i will and that if you will allow me now he took it out of his pocket walked from me and read it and then came to me and took my hand i am half ashamed of myself my dear grandison i own i wanted magnanimity all the distresses of our family on this unhappy girls account were before my eyes and i received you i behaved to you as the author of them i was contriving to be dissatisfied with you forgive me and command my best services i will let our jeronymo know how greatly you subdued me before i had recourse to the letter but that i have since read that part of it which accounts for my sisters passion and wish i had read it with equal attention before i acquit you i am proud of my sister yet i observe from this very letter that jeronymos gratitude has contributed to the evil we deplore but let us not say one word more of the unhappy girl it is painful to me to talk of her not ask a question my lord dont grandison dont jeronymo and clementina are my souls woe but they are not worse than might be apprehended you go to court with me tomorrow i will present you to the king i have had that honour formerly i must depart tomorrow morning early i have already taken leave of several of my friends here i have some to make my compliments to at rome which i reserved for my return you stay with me tonight i intend it my lord well we will return to company i must make my excuses to my friends your departure tomorrow must be one they all admire you they are acquainted with your character they will join with me to engage you if possible to stay longer we returned to the company letter iv miss byron to miss selby receive now my dear the doctors thirteenth letter and the last he intends to favour us with till he entertains us with the histories of mrs beaumont and lady olivia dr bartletts thirteenth letter mr grandison set out next morning the generals behaviour to him at his departure was much more open and free than it was at receiving him mr grandison on his return to florence entered into the affairs of his late friend mr jervois with the spirit and yet with the temper for which he is noted when he engages in any business he put every thing in a happy train in fewer days than it would have cost some other persons months for he was present himself on every occasion and in every business where his presence would accelerate it yet he had embarrassments from olivia he found before he set out for naples that mrs beaumont at the earnest request of the marchioness was gone to bologna at his return not hearing any thing from signor jeronymo he wrote to mrs beaumont requesting her to inform him of the state of things in that family as far as she thought proper and particularly of the health of that dear friend on whose silence to three letters he had written he had the most melancholy apprehensions he let that lady know that he should set out in a very few days for paris if he had no probability of being of service to the family she favoured with her company to this letter mrs beaumont returned the following answer sir i have the favour of yours we are very miserable here the servants are forbidden to answer any inquiries but generally and that not truly your friend signor jeronymo has gone through a severe operation he has been given over but hopes are now entertained not of his absolute recovery but that he will be no worse than he was before the necessity for the operation arose poor man he forgot not however his sister and you when he was out of the power of the opiates that were administered to him on my coming hither i found lady clementina in a deplorable way sometimes raving sometimes gloomy and in bonds twice had she given them apprehensions of fatal attempts they therefore confined her hands they have been excessively wrong in their management of her now soothing now severe observing no method she was extremely earnest to see you before you left bologna on her knees repeatedly she besought this favour and promised to be easy if they would comply but they imagined that their compliance would aggravate the symptoms i very freely blamed them for not complying at the time when she was so desirous of seeing you i told them that soothing her would probably then have done good when they knew you were actually gone from bologna they told her so camilla shocked me with the description of her rage and despair on the communication this was followed by fits of silence and the deepest melancholy they had hopes on my arrival that my company would have been of service to her but for two days together she regarded me not nor any thing i could say to her on the third of my arrival finding her confinement extremely uneasy to her i prevailed but with great difficulty to have her restored to the use of her hands and to be allowed to walk with me in the garden they had hinted to me their apprehensions about a piece of water her woman being near us if there had been occasion for assistance i insensibly led that way she sat down on a seat overagainst the great cascade but she made no motion that gave me apprehensions from this time she has been fonder of me than before the day i obtained this liberty for her she often clasped her arms about me and laid her face in my bosom and i could plainly see it was in gratitude for restoring to her the use of her arms but she cared not to speak indeed she generally affects deep silence yet at times i see her very soul is fretted she moves to one place is tired of that shifts to another and another all round the room i am grieved at my heart for her i never knew a more excellent young creature she is very attentive at her devotions and as constant in them as she used to be every good habit she preserves yet at other times rambles much she is often for writing letters to you but when what she writes is privately taken from her she makes no inquiry about it but takes a new sheet and begins again sometimes she draws but her subjects are generally angels and saints she often meditates in a map of the british dominions and now and then wishes she were in england lady juliana de sforza is earnest to have her with her at urbino or at milan where she has also a noble palace but i hope it will not be granted that lady professes to love her but she cannot be persuaded out of her notion of harsh methods which will never do with clementina i shall not be able to stay long with her the discomposure of so excellent a young creature affects me deeply could i do her either good or pleasure i should be willing to deny myself the society of my dear friends at florence but i am persuaded and have hinted as much that one interview with you would do more to settle her mind than all the methods they have taken i hope sir to see you before you leave italy it must be at florence not at bologna i believe it is generous of you to propose the latter i have now been here a week without hope the doctors they have consulted are all for severe methods and low diet the first i think is in compliment to some of the family she is so loath to take nourishment and when she does is so very abstemious that the regimen is hardly necessary she never or but very seldom used to drink any thing but water she took it into her poor head several times this day and perhaps it will hold to sit in particular places to put on attentive looks as if she were listening to somebody she sometimes smiled and seemed pleased looked up as if to somebody and spoke english i have no doubt though i was not present when she assumed these airs and talked english but her disordered imagination brought before her her tutor instructing her in that tongue you desired me sir to be very particular i have been so but at the expense of my eyes and i shall not wonder if your humane heart should be affected by my sad tale god preserve you and prosper you in whatsoever you undertake hortensia beaumont mrs beaumont staid at bologna twelve days and then left the unhappy young lady at taking leave she asked her what commands she had for her love me said she and pity me that is one another is whispering her you will see the chevalier perhaps though i must not tell him that his poor friend clementina is sometimes very unhappy tell him that she shall rejoice to sit next him in heaven tell him that i say he cannot go thither good man as he is while he shuts his eyes to the truth tell him that i shall take it very kindly of him if he will not think of marrying till he acquaints me with it and can give me assurance that the lady will love him as well as somebody else would have done o mrs beaumont should the chevalier grandison marry a woman unworthy of him what a disgrace would that be to me mr grandison by this time had prepared everything for his journey to paris the friend he honoured with his love was arrived from the levant and the archipelago thither at his patrons request he had accompanied mr beauchamp the amiable friend of both and at parting engaged to continue by letter what had been the subject of their daily conversations and transmit to him as many particulars as he could obtain of mr grandisons sentiments and behaviour on every occasion mr beauchamp proposing him as a pattern to himself that he might be worthy of the credential letters he had furnished him with to every one whom he had thought deserving of his own acquaintance when he was in the parts which mr beauchamp intended to visit to the care of the person so much honoured by his confidence mr grandison left his agreeable ward miss jervois requesting the assistance of mrs beaumont who kindly promised her inspection and with the goodness for which she is so eminently noted performed her promise in his absence he then made an offer to the bishop to visit bologna once more but that not being accepted he set out for paris it was not long before his fathers death called him to england and when he had been there a few weeks he sent for his ward and his friend but my good miss byron you will say that i have not yet fully answered your last inquiry relating to the present situation of the unhappy clementina i will briefly inform you of it when it was known for certain that mr grandison had actually left italy the family at bologna began to wish that they had permitted the interview so much desired by the poor lady and when they afterwards understood that he was sent for to england to take possession of his paternal estate that farther distance the notion likewise of the seas between them appearing formidable added to their regrets the poor lady was kept in travelling motion to quiet her mind for still an interview with mr grandison having never been granted it was her first wish they carried her to urbino to rome to naples then back to florence then to milan to turin whether they made her hope that it was to meet with mr grandison i know not but it is certain she herself expected to see him at the end of every journey and while she was moving was easier and more composed perhaps in that hope the marchioness was sometimes of the party the air and exercise were thought proper for her health as well as for that of her daughter her cousin laurana was always with her in these excursions and sometimes lady sforza and their escort was generally signors sebastiano and juliano but within these four months past these journeyings have been discontinued the young lady accuses them of deluding her with vain hopes she is impatient and has made two attempts to escape from them she is for this reason closely confined and watched they put her once into a nunnery at the motion of lady sforza as for a trial only she was not uneasy in it but this being done unknown to the general when he was apprised of it he for reasons i cannot comprehend was displeased and had her taken out directly her head runs more than ever upon seeing her tutor her friend her chevalier once more they have certainly been to blame if they have let her travel with such hopes because they have thereby kept up her ardour for an interview could she but once more see him she says and let him know the cruelty she has been treated with she should be satisfied he would pity her she is sure though nobody else will the bishop has written to beg that sir charles would pay them one more visit at bologna i will refer to my patron himself the communicating to you ladies his resolution on this subject i had but a moments sight of the letters which so greatly affected him it is but within these few days past that this new request has been made to him in a direct manner the question was before put if such a request should be made would he comply and once camilla wrote as having heard sir charless presence wished for mean time the poor lady is hastening they are afraid into a consumptive malady the count of belvedere however still adores her the disorder in her mind being imputed chiefly to religious melancholy and some of her particular flights not being generally known he who is a pious man himself pities her and declares that he would run all risks of her recovery would the family give her to him and yet he knows that she would choose to be the wife of the chevalier grandison rather than that of any other man were the article of religion to be got over and generously applauds her for preferring her faith to her love signor jeronymo is in a very bad way sir charles often writes to him and with an affection worthy of the merits of that dear friend he was to undergo another severe operation on the next day after the letters came from bologna the success of which was very doubtful how nobly does sir charles appear to support himself under such heavy distresses for those of his friends were ever his but his heart bleeds in secret for them a feeling heart is a blessing that no one who has it would be without and it is a moral security of innocence since the heart that is able to partake of the distress of another cannot wilfully give it i think my good miss byron that i have now as far as i am at present able obeyed all your commands that concern the unhappy clementina and her family i will defer if you please those which relate to olivia and mrs beaumont ladies of very different characters from each other having several letters to write permit me my good ladies and my lord after contributing so much to afflict your worthy hearts to refer you for relief under all the distresses of life whether they affect ourselves or others to those motives that can alone give true support to a rational mind this mortal scene however perplexing is a very short one and the hour is hastening when all the intricacies of human affairs shall be cleared up and all the sorrows that have had their foundation in virtue be changed into the highest joy when all worthy minds shall be united in the same interests the same happiness allow me to be my good miss byron and you my lord and lady l and miss grandison your most faithful and obedient servant ambrose bartlett excellent dr bartlett how worthy of himself is this advice but think you not my lucy that the doctor has in it a particular view to your poor harriet a generous one meaning consolation and instruction to her i will endeavour to profit by it let me have your prayers my dear friends that i may be enabled to succeed in my humble endeavours it will be no wonder to us now that sir charles was not solicitous to make known a situation so embarrassing to himself and so much involved in clouds and uncertainty but whatever may be the event of this affair you lucy and all my friends will hardly ever know me by any other name than that of harriet byron letter v miss harriet byron to miss lucy selby friday march you now my dear friends have before you this affecting story as far as dr bartlett can give it my cousins express a good deal of concern for your harriet so does miss grandison so doth my lord and lady l and the more as i seem to carry off the matter with assumed bravery this their kind concern for me looks however as if they thought me a hypocrite and i suppose therefore that i act my part very awkwardly but my dear as this case is one of those few in which a woman can shew a bravery of spirit i think an endeavour after it is laudable and the rather as in my conduct i aim at giving a tacit example to miss jervois the doctor has whisperd to me that lady olivia is actually on her way to england and that the intelligence sir charles received of her intention was one of the things that disturbed him as the news of his beloved signor jeronymos dangerous condition was another lady anne s it seems has not yet given up her hopes of sir charles the two sisters who once favoured her above all the women they knew have not been able to bring themselves to acquaint a lady of her rank merit and fortune that there can be no hopes and they are still more loath to say that their brother thinks himself under some obligation to a foreign lady yet you know that this was always what we were afraid of but who now will say afraid that knows the merit of clementina i wish methinks that this man were proud vain arrogant and a boaster how easily then might one throw off ones shackles lord g is very diligent in his court to miss grandison his father and aunt are to visit her this afternoon she behaves whimsically to my lord yet i cannot think that she greatly dislikes him the earl of d and the countess dowager are both in town the countess made a visit to my cousin reeves last tuesday she spoke of me very kindly she says that my lord has heard so much of me that he is very desirous of seeing me but she was pleased to say that since my heart was not disengaged she should be afraid of the consequences of his visit to himself my grandmamma though she was so kindly fond of me would not suffer me to live with her because she thought that her contemplative temper might influence mine and make me grave at a time of life when she is always saying that cheerfulness is most becoming she would therefore turn over her girl to the best of aunts but now i fancy she will allow me to be more than two days in a week her attendant my uncle selby will be glad to spare me i shall not be able to bear a jest and then what shall i be good for i have made a fine hand of coming to town he says and so i have but if my heart is not quite so easy as it was it is i hope a better at least not a worse heart than i brought up with me could i only have admired this man my excursion would not have been unhappy but this gratitude this entangling with all its painful consequence but let me say with my grandmamma the man is sir charles grandison the very man by whose virtues a clementina was attracted upon my word my dear unhappy as she is i rank her with the first of women i have not had a great deal of sir charles grandisons company but yet more i am afraid than i shall ever have again very true o heart the most wayward of hearts sigh if thou wilt you have seen how little he was with us when we were absolutely in his reach and when he as we thought was in ours but such a man cannot ought not to be engrossed by one family bless me lucy when he comes into public life for has not his country a superior claim to him beyond every private one what moment can he have at liberty let me enumerate some of his present engagements that we know of the danby family must have some farther portion of his time the executorship in the disposal of the in charity in france as well as in england will take up a good deal more my lord w may be said to be under his tutelage as to the future happiness of his life miss jervoiss affairs and the care he has for her person engage much of his attention he is his own steward he is making alterations at grandisonhall and has a large genteel neighbourhood there who long to have him reside among them and he himself is fond of that seat his estate in ireland is in a prosperous way from the works he set on foot there when he was on the spot and he talks as dr bartlett has hinted to us of making another visit to it his sisters match with lord g is one of his cares he has services to perform for his friend beauchamp with his father and motherinlaw for the facilitating his coming over the apprehended visit of olivia gives him disturbance and the bologna family in its various branches and more especially signor jeronymos dangerous state of health and signora clementinas disordered mind o lucy what leisure has this man to be in love yet how can i say so when he is in love already and with clementina and dont you think that when he goes to france on the executorship account he will make a visit to bologna ah my dear to be sure he will after he has left england therefore which i suppose he will quickly do and when i am in northamptonshire what opportunities will your harriet have to see him except she can obtain as a favour the power of obliging his emily in her request to be with her then lucy he may on his return to england once a year or so on his visiting his ward see and thank for her care and love of his emily his halfestranged harriet perhaps lady clementina grandison will be with him god restore her surely i shall be capable if she be lady grandison of rejoicing in her recovery fie upon it why this involuntary tear you would see it by the large blot it has made if i did not mention it excellent man dr bartlett has just been telling me of a morning visit he received before he went out of town from the two sons of mrs oldham one of them is about seven years old the other about five very fine children he embraced them the doctor says with as much tenderness as if they were children of his own mother he enquired into their inclinations behaviour diversions and engaged equally their love and reverence he told them that if they were good he would love them and said he had a dear friend whom he reverenced as his father a man with white curling locks he told the children that they might know him at first sight who would nowandthen as he happened to be in town make enquiries after their good behaviour and reward them as they gave him cause accordingly he had desired dr bartlett to give them occasionally his countenance as also to let their mother know that he should be glad of a visit from her and her three children on his return to town the doctor had been to see her when he came to me he found all three with her the two younger impressed by the venerable description sir charles had given of him voluntarily the younger by the elders example fell down on their knees before him and begged his blessing mr oldham is about eighteen years of age a wellinclined welleducated youth he was full of acknowledgments of the favour done him in this invitation the grateful mother could not contain herself blessings without number she invoked on her benefactor for his goodness in taking such kind notice of her two sons as he had done and said he had been ever since his gracious behaviour to her in essex the first and last in her prayers to heaven but the invitation to herself she declared was too great an honour for her to accept of she should not be able to stand in his presence alas sir said she can the severest truest penitence recall the guilty past the doctor said that sir charles grandison ever made it a rule with him to raise the dejected and humbled spirit your birth and education madam entitle you to a place in the first company and where there are two lights in which the behaviour of any person may be set though there has been unhappiness he always remembers the most favourable and forgets the other i would advise you madam as he has invited you by all means to come he speaks with pleasure of your humility and good sense the doctor told me that sir charles had made inquiries after the marriage of major ohara with mrs jervois and had satisfied himself that they were actually man and wife methinks i am glad for miss jervoiss sake that her mother has changed her name they lived not happily together since their last enterprise for the man who had long been a sufferer from poverty was in fear of losing one half at least of his wifes annuity by what passed on that occasion and accused her of putting him upon the misbehaviour he was guilty of which had brought upon him he said the resentments of a man admired by all the world the attorney who visited sir charles from these people at their request waited on him again in their names with hopes that they should not suffer in their annuity and expressing their concern for having offended him mrs ohara also requested it as a favour to see her daughter sir charles commissioned the attorney who is a man of repute to tell them that if mrs ohara would come to st jamesssquare next wednesday about five oclock miss jervois should be introduced to her and she should be welcome to bring with her her husband and captain salmonet that they might be convinced he bore no illwill to either of them adieu till by and by miss grandison is come in one of her usual hurries to oblige me to be present at the visit to be made her this afternoon by the earl of g and lady gertrude his sister a maiden lady advanced in years who is exceedingly fond of her nephew and intends to make him heir of her large fortune friday night the earl is an agreeable man lady gertrude is a very agreeable woman they saw miss grandison with the young lords eyes and were better pleased with her as i told her afterwards than i should have been or than they would had they known her as well as i do she doubted not she answered me but i should find fault with her and yet she was as good as for her life she could be such an archness in every motion such a turn of the eye to me on my lord gs assiduities such a fear in him of her correcting glance such a halftimid halffree parade when he had done any thing that he intended to be obliging and now and then an aiming at raillery as if he was not very much afraid of her and dared to speak his mind even to her on her part on those occasions such an air as if she had a learner before her and was ready to rap his knuckles had nobody been present to mediate for him that though i could not but love her for her very archness yet in my mind i could for their sakes but more for her own have severely chidden her she is a charming woman and every thing she says and does becomes her but i am so much afraid of what may be the case when the lover is changed into the husband that i wish to myself now and then when i see her so lively that she would remember that there was once such a man as captain anderson but she makes it a rule she says to remember nothing that will vex her is not my memory said she once given me for my benefit and shall i make it my torment no harriet i will leave that to be done by you wise ones and see what you will get by it why this charlotte replied i the wise ones may have a chance to get by it they will very probably by remembering past mistakes avoid many inconveniencies into which forgetfulness will run you lively ones well well returned she we are not all of us born to equal honour some of us are to be set up for warnings some for examples and the first are generally of greater use to the world than the other now charlotte said i do you destroy the force of your own argument can the person who is singled out for the warning be near so happy as she that is set up for the example you are right as far as i know harriet but i obey the present impulse and try to find an excuse afterwards for what that puts me upon and all the difference is this as to the reward i have a joy you a comfort but comfort is a poor word and i cant bear it so biddy in the tender husband would have said charlotte but poor as the word is with you and her give me comfort rather than joy if they must be separated but i see not but that a woman of my charlottes happy turn may have both she tapped my cheek take that harriet for making a biddy of me i believe if you have not joy you have comfort in your severity my heart as well as my cheek glowed at the praises the earl and the lady both joined in with a fervor that was creditable to their own hearts of sir charles grandison while they told us what this man and that woman of quality or consideration said of him who would not be good what is life without reputation do we not wish to be remembered with honour after death and what a share of it has this excellent man in his life may nothing for the honoursake of human nature to which he is so great an ornament ever happen to tarnish it they made me a hundred fine compliments i could not but be pleased at standing well in their opinion but believe me my dear i did not enjoy their praises of me as i did those they gave him indeed i had the presumption from the approbation given to what they said of him by my own heart to imagine myself a sharer in them though not in his merits oh lucy ought there not to have been a relation between us since what i have said from what i found in myself on hearing him praised is a demonstration of a regard for him superior to the love of self adieu my lucy i know i have all your prayers adieu my dear letter vi miss byron in continuation saturday april dr bartlett is one of the kindest as well as best of men i believe he loves me as if i were his own child but good men must be affectionate men he received but this morning a letter from sir charles and hastened to communicate some of its contents to me though i could pretend to no other motive but curiosity for wishing to be acquainted with the proceedings of his patron sir charles dined as he had intended with sir hargrave and his friends he complains in his letter of a riotous day yet i think adds he it has led me into some useful reflections it is not indeed agreeable to be the spectator of riot but how easy to shun being a partaker in it ho easy to avoid the too freely circling glass if a man is known to have established a rule to himself from which he will not depart and if it be not refused sullenly but mirth and good humour the more studiously kept up by the person who would else indeed be looked upon as a spy on unguarded folly i heartily pitied a young man who i dare say has a good heart but from false shame durst not assert the freedom that every englishman would claim a right to in almost every other instance he had once put by the glass and excused himself on account of his health but on being laughed at for a sober dog as they phrased it and asked if his spouse had not lectured him before he came out he gave way to the wretched raillery nor could i interfere at such a noisy moment with effect they had laughed him out of his caution before i could be heard and i left him there at nine oclock trying with bagenhall which should drink the deepest i wish my good dr bartlett you would throw together some serious considerations on this subject you could touch it delicately and such a discourse would not be unuseful to some few of our neighbours even at grandisonhall what is it that in this single article men sacrifice to false shame and false glory reason health fortune personal elegance the peace and order of their families and all the comfort and honour of their afteryears how peevish how wretched is the decline of a man worn out with intemperance in a cool hour resolutions might be formed that should stand the attack of a boisterous jest i obtained leave from dr bartlett to transcribe this part of the letter i thought my uncle would be pleased with it it was near ten at night before sir charles got to lord ws though but three miles from sir hargraves my lord rejoiced to see him and after first compliments asked him if he had thought of what he had undertaken for him sir charles told him that he was the more desirous of seeing him in his way to the hall because he wanted to know if his lordship held his mind as to marriage he assured him he did and would sign and seal to whatever he should stipulate for him i wished for a copy of this part of sir charless letter for the sake of my aunt whose delicacy would i thought be charmed with it he has been so good as to say he would transcribe it for me i will enclose it lucy and you will read it here i cannot my lord said sir charles engage that the lady will comply with the proposal i shall take the liberty to make to her mother and her she is not more than three or four and thirty she is handsome she has a fine understanding she is brought up an economist she is a woman of good family she has not however though born to happier prospects a fortune worthy of your lordships acceptance whatever that is you will perhaps choose to give it to her family with all my heart and soul nephew but do you say she is handsome do you say she is of family and has she so many good qualities ah nephew she wont have me i doubt and is she not too young sir charles to think of such a poor decrepit soul as i am all i can say to this my lord is that the proposals on your part must be the more generous i will leave all those matters to you kinsman this my lord i will take upon me to answer for that she is a woman of principle she will not give your lordship her hand if she thinks she cannot make you a wife worthy of your utmost kindness and now my lord i will tell you who she is that you may make what other inquiries you think proper and then i named her to him and gave him pretty near the account of the family and the circumstances and affairs of it that i shall by and by give you though you are not quite a stranger to the unhappy case my lord was in raptures he knew something he said of the ladys father and enough of the family by hearsay to confirm all i had said of them and besought me to do my utmost to bring the affair to a speedy conclusion sir thomas mansfield was a very good man and much respected in his neighbourhood he was once possessed of a large estate but his father left him involved in a lawsuit to support his title to more than one half of it after it had been depending several years it was at last to the deep regret of all who knew him by the chicanery of the lawyers of the opposite side and the remissness of his own carried against him and his expenses having been very great in supporting for years his possession he found himself reduced from an estate of near three thousand pounds a year to little more than five hundred he had six children four sons and two daughters his eldest son died of grief in two months after the loss of the cause the second now the eldest is a melancholy man the third is a cornet of horse the fourth is unprovided for but all three are men of worthy minds and deserve better fortune the daughters are remarkable for their piety patience good economy and prudence they are the most dutiful of children and most affectionate of sisters they were for three years the support of their fathers spirits and have always been the consolation of their mother they lost their father about four years ago and it is even edifying to observe how elegantly they support the family reputation in their fine old mansionhouse by the prudent management of their little income for the mother leaves every household care to them and they make it a rule to conclude the year with discharging every demand that can be made upon them and to commence the new year absolutely clear of the world and with some cash in hand yet were brought up in affluence and to the expectation of handsome fortunes for besides that they could have no thought of losing their cause they had very great and reasonable prospects from mr calvert an uncle by their mothers side who was rich in money and had besides an estate in land of a year he always declared that for the sake of his sisters children he would continue a single man and kept his word till he was upwards of seventy when being very infirm in health and defective even to dotage in his understanding bolton his steward who had always stood in the way of his inclination to have his eldest niece for his companion and manager at last contrived to get him married to a young creature under twenty one of the servants in the house who brought him a child in seven months and was with child again at the old mans death which happened in eighteen months after his marriage and then a will was provided in which he gave all he had to his wife and her children born and to be born within a year after his demise this steward and woman now live together as man and wife a worthy clergyman who hoped it might be in my power to procure them redress either in the one case or in the other gave me the above particulars and upon inquiry finding every thing to be as represented i made myself acquainted with the widow lady and her sons and it was impossible to see them at their own house and not respect the daughters for their amiable qualities i desired them when i was last down to put into my hands their titles deeds and papers which they have done and they have been laid before counsel who give a very hopeful account of them being fully authorized by my lord i took leave of him overnight and set out early in the morning directly for mansfieldhouse i arrived there soon after their breakfast was over and was received by lady mansfield her sons who happened to be all at home and her two daughters with politeness after some general conversation i took lady mansfield aside and making an apology for my freedom asked her if miss mansfield were to her knowledge engaged in her affections she answered she was sure she was not ah sir said she a man of your observation must know that the daughters of a decayed family of some note in the world do not easily get husbands men of great fortunes look higher men of small must look out for wives to enlarge them and men of genteel businesses are afraid of young women better born than portioned every body knows not that my girls can bend to their condition and they must be contented to live single all their lives and so they will choose to do rather than not marry creditably and with some prospect i then opened my mind fully to her she was agreeably surprised but who sir said she would expect such a proposal from the next heir to lord w i made known to her how much in earnest i was in this proposal as well for my lords sake as for the young ladys i will take care madam said i that miss mansfield if she will consent to make lord w happy shall have very handsome settlements and such an allowance for pinmoney as shall enable her to gratify every moderate every reasonable wish of her heart was it possible she asked for such an affair to be brought about would my lord there she stopt i said i would be answerable for him and desired her to break the matter to her daughter directly i left lady mansfield and joined the brothers who were with their two sisters and soon after miss mansfield was sent for by her mother after they had been a little while together my lady mansfield sent to speak with me they were both silent when i came in the mother was at a loss what to say the daughter was in still greater confusion i addressed myself to the mother you have i perceive madam acquainted miss mansfield with the proposal i made to you i am fully authorized to make it propitious be your silence there never was proceeded i a treaty of marriage set on foot that had not its conveniencies and inconveniencies my lord is greatly afflicted with the gout there is too great a disparity in years these are the inconveniencies which are to be considered of for the lady on the other hand if miss mansfield can give into the proposal she will be received by my lord as a blessing as one whose acceptance of him will lay him under an obligation to her if this proposal could not have been made with dignity and honour to the lady it had not come from me the conveniencies to yourselves will more properly fall under the consideration of yourselves and family one thing only i will suggest that an alliance with so rich a man as lord w will make perhaps some people tremble who now think themselves secure but madam to the still silent daughter let not a regard for me bias you your family may be sure of my best services whether my proposal be received or rejected my lord i must deal sincerely with you has lived a life of error he thinks so himself i am earnest to have him see the difference and to have an opportunity to rejoice with him upon it i stopt but both being still silent the mother looking on the daughter the daughter glancing now and then her conscious eye on the mother if madam said i you can give your hand to lord w i will take care that settlements shall exceed your expectation what i have observed as well as heard of miss mansfields temper and goodness is the principal motive of my application to her in preference to all the women i know but permit me to say that were your affections engaged to the lowest honest man on earth i would not wish for your favour to my lord w and further if madam you think you should have but the shadow of a hope to induce your compliance that my lords death would be more agreeable to you than his life then would i not for your moralitys sake wish you to engage in a word i address myself to you miss mansfield as to a woman of honour and conscience if your conscience bids you doubt reject the proposal and this not only for my lords sake but for your own consider if without too great a force upon your inclinations you can behave with that condescension and indulgence to a man who has hastened advanced age upon himself which i have thought from your temper i might hope i have said a great deal because you ladies were silent and because explicitness in every case becomes the proposer give me leave to withdraw for a few moments i withdrew accordingly to the brothers and sister i did not think i ought to mention to them the proposal i had made it might perhaps have engaged them all in its favour as it was of such evident advantage to the whole family and that might have imposed a difficulty on the lady that neither for her own sake nor my lords it would have been just to lay upon her lady mansfield came out to me and said i presume sir as we are a family which misfortune as well as love has closely bound together you will allow it to be mentioned to the whole family madam by all means i wanted only first to know whether miss mansfields affections were disengaged and now you shall give me leave to attend miss mansfield i am a party for my lord w miss mansfield is a party your debates will be the more free in our absence if i find her averse believe me madam i will not endeavour to persuade her on the contrary if she declare against accepting the proposal i will be her advocate though every one else should vote in its favour the brothers and sister looked upon one another i left the mother to propose it to them and stept into the inner parlour to miss mansfield she was sitting with her back to the door in a meditating posture she started at my entrance i talked of indifferent subjects in order to divert her from the important one that had taken up her whole attention it would have been a degree of oppression to her to have entered with her upon a subject of so much consequence to her while we were alone and when her not having given a negative was to be taken as a modest affirmative lady mansfield soon joined us my dear daughter said she we are all unanimous we have agreed to leave every thing to sir charles grandison and we hope you will she was silent i will only ask you madam said i to her if you have any wish to take time to consider of the matter do you think you shall be easier in your mind if you take time she was silent i will not at this time my good miss mansfield urge you further i will make my report to lord w and you shall be sure of his joyful approbation of the steps i have taken before your final consent shall be asked for but that i may not be employed in a doubtful cause let me be commissioned to tell my lord that you are disengaged and that you wholly resign yourself to your mothers advice she bowed her head and that you madam to lady mansfield are not averse to enter into treaty upon this important subject averse sir said the mother bowing and gratefully smiling i will write the particulars of our conversation to lord w and my opinion of settlements and advise him if i am not forbid to make a visit at mansfield house i stopt they were both silent if possible i will attend my lord in his first visit i hope madam to miss mansfield you will not dislike him i am sure he will be charmed with you he is far from being disagreeable in his person his temper is not bad your goodness will make him good i dare say that he will engage your gratitude and i defy a good mind to separate love from gratitude we returned to company i had all their blessings pronounced at once as from one mouth the melancholy brother was enlivened who knows but the consequence of this alliance may illuminate his mind i could see by the pleasure they all had in beholding him capable of joy on the occasion that they hoped it would the unhappy situation of the family affairs as it broke the heart of the eldest brother fixed a gloom on the temper of this gentleman i was prevailed upon to dine with them in the conversation we had at and after dinner their minds opened and their characters rose upon me lord w will be charmed with miss mansfield i am delighted to think that my mothers brother will be happy in the latter part of his life with a wife of so much prudence and goodness as i am sure this lady will make him on one instance of her very obliging behaviour to me i whispered her sister pray miss fanny tell miss mansfield but not till i am gone that she knows not the inconveniencies she is bringing upon herself i may perhaps hereafter have the boldness to look for the same favour from my aunt that i meet with from miss mansfield if my sister returned she should ever misbehave to her benefactor i will deny my relation to her you will soon have another letter from me with an account of the success of my visit to sir harry beauchamp and his lady we must have our beauchamp among us my dear friend i should rather say you must among you for i shall not be long in england he will supply to you my dear dr bartlett the absence it will not i hope be a long one of your charles grandison sir charles i remember as the doctor read mentions getting leave for his beauchamp to come over who he says will supply his absence to him but ah lucy who let me have the boldness to ask shall supply it to your harriet time my dear will do nothing for me except i could hear something very much amiss of this man i have a great suspicion that the first part of the letter enclosed was about me the doctor looked so earnestly at me when he skipt two sides of it and as i thought with so much compassion to be sure it was about me what would i give to know as much of his mind as dr bartlett knows if i thought he pitied the poor harriet i should scorn myself i am i will be above his pity lucy in this believe your harriet byron letter vii miss byron in continuation sunday night april dr bartlett has received from sir charles an account of what passed last friday between him and sir harry and lady beauchamp by the doctors allowance i enclose it to you in this letter lucy you will see him in a new light and as a man whom there is no resisting when he resolves to carry a point but it absolutely convinces me of what indeed i before suspected that he has not an high opinion of our sex in general and this i will put down as a blot in his character he treats us in lady beauchamp as perverse humoursome babies loving power yet not knowing how to use it see him so delicate in his behaviour and address to miss mansfield and carry in your thoughts his gaiety and adroit management to lady beauchamp as in this letter and you will hardly think him the same man could he be any thing to me i should be more than half afraid of him yet this may be said in his behalf he but accommodates himself to the persons he has to deal with he can be a man of gay wit when he pleases to descend as indeed his sister charlotte has as often found as she has given occasion for the exercise of that talent in him yet that virtue for its own sake is his choice since had he been a free liver he would have been a dangerous man but i will not anticipate too much read it here if you please letter viii sir charles grandison to dr bartlett enclosed in the preceding grandison hall friday night march i arrived at sir harry beauchamps about twelve this day he and his lady expected me from the letter which i wrote and shewed you before i left the town in which you know i acquainted sir harry with his sons earnest desire to throw himself at his feet and to pay his duty to his mother in england and engaged to call myself either this day or tomorrow for an answer sir harry received me with great civility and even affection lady beauchamp said he will be with us in a moment i am afraid you will not meet with all the civility from her on the errand you are come upon that a man of sir charles grandisons character deserves to meet with from all the world we have been unhappy together ever since we had your letter i long to see my son your friendship for him establishes him in my heart but and then he cursed the apronstring tenure by which he said he held his peace you will allow me sir harry said i to address myself in my own way to my lady you give me pleasure in letting me know that the difficulty is not with you you have indeed sir one of the most prudent young men in the world for your son his heart is in your hand you may form it as you please she is coming she is coming interrupted he we are all in pieces we were in the midst of a feud when you arrived if she is not civil to you in swam the lady her complexion raised displeasure in her looks to me and indignation in her air to sir harry as if they had not had their contention out and she was ready to renew it with as obliging an air as i could assume i paid my compliments to her she received them with great stiffness swelling at sir harry who sidled to the door in a moody and sullen manner and then slipt out you are sir charles grandison i suppose sir said she i never saw you before i have heard much talk of you but pray sir are good men always officious men cannot they perform the obligations of friendship without discomposing families you see me now madam in an evil moment if you are displeased with me but i am not used to the displeasure of ladies i do my utmost not to deserve it and let me tell you madam that i will not suffer you to be displeased with me i took her halfreluctant hand and led her to a chair and seated myself in another near her i see sir you have your arts she took the firescreen that hung by the side of the chimney and held it before her face now glancing at me now turning away her eye as if resolved to be displeased you come upon a hateful errand sir i have been unhappy ever since your officious letter came i am sorry for it madam while you are warm with the remembrance of a past misunderstanding i will not offer to reason with you but let me madam see less discomposure in your looks i want to take my impressions of you from more placid features i am a painter madam i love to draw ladys pictures will you have this pass for a first sitting she knew not what to do with her anger she was loath to part with it you are impertinent sir charles excuse me you are impertinent i do excuse you lady beauchamp and the rather as i am sure you do not think me so your freedom is a mark of your favour and i thank you for it you treat me as a child sir i treat all angry people as children i love to humour them indeed lady beauchamp you must not be angry with me can i be mistaken dont i see in your aspect the woman of sense and reason i never blame a lady for her humoursomeness so much as in my mind i blame her mother sir said she i smiled she bit her lip to avoid returning a smile her character my dear friend is not you know that of an illtempered woman though haughty and a lover of power i have heard much of you sir charles grandison but i am quite mistaken in you i expected to see a grave formal young man his prim mouth set in plaits but you are a joker and a free man a very free man i do assure you i would be thought decently free madam but not impertinent i see with pleasure a returning smile o that ladies knew how much smiles become their features very few causes can justify a womans anger your sex madam was given to delight not to torment us torment you sir pray has sir harry sir harry cannot look pleased when his lady is displeased i saw that you were madam the moment i beheld you i hope i am not an unwelcome visitor to sir harry for one hour i intend to stay no longer that he received me with so disturbed a countenance and has now withdrawn himself as if to avoid me to tell you the truth sir harry and i have had a dispute but he always speaks of sir charles grandison with pleasure is he not offended with me madam for the contents of the letter no sir and i suppose you hardly think he is but i am dear madam let me beg your interest in favour of the contents of it she took fire rose up i besought her patience why should you wish to keep abroad a young man who is a credit to his family and who ought to be if he is not the joy of his father let him owe to your generosity madam that recall which he solicits it will become your character he cannot be always kept abroad be it your own generous work what sir pray sir with an angry brow you must not be angry with me madam i took her hand you cant be angry in earnest sir charles grandison you are she withdrew her hand you are repeated she and seemed ready to call names i am the grandison you call me and i honour the maternal character you must permit me to honour you madam i wonder sir i will not be denied the world reports misunderstandings between you and mr beauchamp that busy world that will be meddling knows your power and his dependence you must not let it charge you with an ill use of that power if you do you will have its blame when you might have its praise he will have its pity what sir do you think your fine letters and smooth words will avail in favour of a young fellow who has treated me with disrespect you are misinformed madam i am willing to have a greater dependence upon your justice upon your goodnature than upon any thing i can urge either by letter or speech dont let it be said that you are not to be prevailed on a woman not to be prevailed on to join in an act of justice of kindness for the honour of the sex let it not be said honour of the sex sir fine talking dont i know that were i to consent to his coming over the first thing would be to have his annuity augmented out of my fortune he and his father would be in a party against me am i not already a sufferer through him in his fathers love you dont know sir what has passed between sir harry and me within this halfhour but dont talk to me i wont hear of it the young man hates me i hate him and ever will she made a motion to go with a respectful air i told her she must not leave me my motive deserved not i said that both she and sir harry should leave me in displeasure you know but too well resumed she how acceptable your officiousness i must call it so is to sir harry and does sir harry madam favour his sons suit you rejoice me let not mr beauchamp know that he does and do you my dear lady beauchamp take the whole merit of it to yourself how will he revere you for your goodness to him and what an obligation if as you say sir harry is inclined to favour him will you by your generous first motion lay upon sir harry obligation upon sir harry yes sir charles grandison i have laid too many obligations already upon him for his gratitude lay this one more you own you have had a misunderstanding this morning sir harry is withdrawn i suppose with his heart full let me i beseech you make up the misunderstanding i have been happy in this way thus we will order it we will desire him to walk in i will beg your interest with him in favour of the contents of the letter i sent his compliance will follow as an act of obligingness to you the grace of the action will be yours i will be answerable for mr beauchamps gratitude dear madam hesitate not the young gentleman must come over one day let the favour of its being an early one be owing entirely to you you are a strange man sir i dont like you at all you would persuade me out of my reason let us madam as mr beauchamp and i are already the dearest of friends begin a family understanding let st jamesssquare and berkleysquare when you come to town be a nextdoor neighbourhood give me the consideration of being the bondsman for the duty of mr beauchamp to you as well as to his father she was silent but looked vexed and irresolute my sisters madam are amiable women you will be pleased with them lord l is a man worthy of sir harrys acquaintance we shall want nothing if you would think so but mr beauchamps presence among us what i suppose you design your maiden sister for the young fellow but if you do sir you must ask me for there she stopt indeed i do not he is not at present disposed to marry he never will without his fathers approbation and let me say yours my sister is addressed to by lord g and i hope will soon be married to him and do you say so sir charles grandison why then you are a more disinterested man than i thought you in this application to sir harry i had no doubt but the young fellow was to be brought over to marry miss grandison and that he was to be made worthy of her at my expense she enjoyed as it seemed by her manner of pronouncing the words young fellow that designed contempt which was a tacit confession of the consequence he once was of to her i do assure you madam that i know not his heart if he has at present any thoughts of marriage she seemed pleased at this assurance i repeated my wishes that she would take to herself the merit of allowing mr beauchamp to return to his native country and that she would let me see her hand in sir harrys before i left them and pray sir as to his place of residence were he to come do you think he should live under the same roof with me you shall govern that point madam as you approve or disapprove of his behaviour to you his behaviour to me sir one house cannot shall not hold him and me i think madam that you should direct in this article i hope after a little while so to order my affairs as constantly to reside in england i should think myself very happy if i could prevail upon mr beauchamp to live with me but i must see him i suppose not madam unless you shall think it right for the sake of the worlds opinion that you should i cant consent you can madam you do i cannot allow lady beauchamp to be one of those women who having insisted upon a wrong point can be convinced yet not know how to recede with a grace be so kind to yourself as to let sir harry know that you think it right for mr beauchamp to return but that it must be upon your own conditions then madam make those conditions generous ones and how will sir harry adore you how will mr beauchamp revere you how shall i esteem you what a strange impertinent have i before me i love to be called names by a lady if undeservedly she lays herself by them under obligation to me which she cannot be generous if she resolves not to repay shall i endeavour to find out sir harry or will you madam was you ever sir charles grandison denied by any woman to whom you sued for favour i think madam i hardly ever was but it was because i never sued for a favour that it was not for a ladys honour to grant this is the case now and this makes me determine that i will not be denied the grant of my present request come come madam how can a woman of your ladyships good sense taking her hand and leading her to the door seem to want to be persuaded to do a thing she knows in her heart to be right let us find sir harry strange man unhand me he has used me unkindly overcome him then by your generosity but dear lady beauchamp taking both her hands and smiling confidently in her face i could my dear dr bartlett do so to lady beauchamp will you make me believe that a woman of your spirit you have a charming spirit lady beauchamp did not give sir harry as much reason to complain as he gave you i am sure by his disturbed countenance now sir charles grandison you are downright affronting unhand me this misunderstanding is owing to my officious letter i should have waited on you in person i should from the first have put it in your power to do a graceful and obliging thing i ask your pardon i am not used to make differences between man and wife i touched first one hand then the other of the perverse baby with my lips now am i forgiven now is my friend beauchamp permitted to return to his native country now are sir harry and his lady reconciled come come madam it must be so what foolish things are the quarrels of married people they must come to an agreement again and the sooner the better before hard blows are struck that will leave marks let us dear madam find out sir harry and then with an air of vivacity that women whether in courtship or out of it dislike not i was leading her once more to the door and as i intended to sir harry wherever he could be found hold hold sir resisting but with features far more placid than she had suffered to be before visible if i must be compelled you are a strange man sir charles grandison if i must be compelled to see sir harry but you are a strange man and she rang the bell lady beauchamp dr bartlett is one of those who would be more ready to forgive an innocent freedom than to be gratified by a profound respect otherwise i had not treated her with so little ceremony such women are formidable only to those who are afraid of their anger or who make it a serious thing but when the servant appeared she not knowing how to condescend i said go to your master sir and tell him that your lady requests the favour requests the favour repeated she but in a low voice which was no bad sign the servant went with a message worded with more civility than perhaps he was used to carry to his master from his lady now dear lady beauchamp for your own sake for sir harrys sake make happy and be happy are there not dear madam unhappinesses enow in life that we must wilfully add to them sir harry came in sight he stalked towards us with a parade like that of a young officer wanting to look martial at the head of his company could i have seen him before he entered my work would have been easier but his hostile air disposed my lady to renew hostilities she turned her face aside then her person and the cloudy indignation with which she entered at first again overspread her features ought wrath dr bartlett to be so ready to attend a female will surely thought i my ladys present airs after what has passed between her and me can be only owing to the fear of making a precedent and being thought too easily persuaded sir harry said i addressing myself to him i have obtained lady beauchamps pardon for the officious letter pardon sir charles grandison you are a good man and it was kindly intended he was going on anger from his eyes flashed upon his cheekbones and made them shine my ladys eyes struck fire at sir harry and shewed that she was not afraid of him better intended than done interrupted i since my lady tells me that it was the occasion of a misunderstanding but sir all will be right my lady assures me that you are not disinclined to comply with the contents and she has the goodness pray sir charles interrupted the lady to give me hopes that she pray sir charles will use her interest to confirm you in your favourable sentiments sir harry cleared up at once may i hope madam and offered to take her hand she withdrew it with an air o dr bartlett i must have been thought an unpolite husband had she been my wife i took her hand excuse this freedom sir harry for heavens sake madam whispering do what i know you will do with a grace shall there be a misunderstanding and the husband court a refused hand i then forced her halfunwilling hand into his with an air that i intended should have both freedom and respect in it what a man have we got here sir harry this cannot be the modest man that you have praised to me i thought a good man must of necessity be bashful if not sheepish and here your visitor is the boldest man in england the righteous lady beauchamp said sir harry with an aspect but halfconceding is bold as a lion and must i be compelled thus and by such a man to forgive you sir harry indeed you were very unkind and you lady beauchamp were very cruel i did not think sir when i laid my fortune at your feet o lady beauchamp you said cutting things very cutting things and did not you sir harry say it should be so so very peremptorily not madam till you as peremptorily a little recrimination thought i there must be to keep each in countenance on their past folly ah sir charles you may rejoice that you are not married said sir harry dear sir harry said i we must bear with ladies they are meek good creatures they meek sir charles repeated sir harry with a halfangry smile and shrugging as if his shoulder had been hurt with his wifes meekness say meek now sir charles grandison said my lady with an air of threatening i was desirous either of turning the ladys displeasure into a jest or of diverting it from the first object in order to make her play with it till she had lost it women are of gentle natures pursued i and being accustomed to be humoured opposition sits not easy upon them are they not kind to us sir harry when they allow of our superiority by expecting us to bear with their pretty perversenesses o sir charles grandison said my lady both her hands lifted up let us be contented proceeded i with such their kind acknowledgments and in pity to them and in compliment to ourselves bear with their foibles see madam i ever was an advocate for the ladies sir charles i have no patience with you what can a poor woman do continued i when opposed she can only be a little violent in words and when she has said as much as she chooses to say be perhaps a little sullen for my part were i so happy as to call a woman mine and she happened to be in the wrong i would endeavour to be in the right and trust to her good sense to recover her temper arguments only beget arguments those reconciliations are the most durable in which the lady makes the advances what doctrine is this sir charles you are not the man i took you for i believe in my conscience that you are not near so good a man as the world reports you what madam because i pretend to know a little of the sex surely lady beauchamp a man of common penetration may see to the bottom of a womans heart a cunning woman cannot hide it a good woman will not you are not madam such mysteries as some of us think you whenever you know your own minds we need not be long doubtful that is all the difficulty and i will vindicate you as to that as how pray sir women madam were designed to be dependent as well as gentle creatures and of consequence when left to their own wills they know not what to resolve upon i was hoping sir charles just now that you would stay to dinner but if you talk at this rate i believe i shall be ready to wish you out of the house sir harry looked as if he were halfwilling to be diverted at what passed between his lady and me it was better for me to say what he could not but subscribe to by his feeling than for him to say it though reproof seldom amends a determined spirit such a one as this ladys yet a man who suffers by it cannot but have some joy when he hears his sentiments spoken by a bystander this freedom of mine seemed to save the married pair a good deal of recrimination you remind me madam that i must be gone rising and looking at my watch you must not leave us sir charles said sir harry i beg excuse sir harry yours also madam smiling lady beauchamp must not twice wish me out of the house i will not excuse you sir replied she if you have a desire to see the matter completed she stopt you must stay to dinner be that as it will be that as it will madam you shall not recede recede i have not yet complied o these women they are so used to courtship that they know not how to do right things without it and pardon me madam not always with it bold man have i consented have you not madam given a ladys consent that we men expect not to be very explicit very gracious it is from such nonnegative consents that we men make silence answer all we wish i leave sir charles grandison to manage this point said sir harry in my conscience i think the common observation just a standerby sees more of the game than he that plays it ever will be so sir harry but i will tell you my lady and i have as good as agreed the matter i have agreed to nothing sir harry hush madam i am doing you credit lady beauchamp speaks aside sometimes sir harry you are not to hear any thing she says that you dont like then i am afraid i must stop my ears for eight hours out of twelve that was aside lady beauchamp you are not to hear that to sit like a fool and hear myself abused a pretty figure i make sir charles grandison let me tell you that you are the first man that ever treated me like a fool excuse madam a little innocent raillery i met you both with a discomposure on your countenances i was the occasion of it by the letter i sent to sir harry i will not leave you discomposed i think you a woman of sense and my request is of such a nature that the granting of it will confirm to me that you are so but you have granted it i have not thats charmingly said my lady will not undervalue the compliment she is inclined to make you sir harry the moment you ask for her compliance she will not refuse to your affection what she makes a difficulty to grant to the entreaty of an almost stranger let it let it be so lady beauchamp said sir harry and he clasped his arms about her as she sat there never was such a man as this sir charles grandison in the world it is a contrivance between you sir harry dear lady beauchamp resumed i depreciate not your compliment to sir harry there wanted not contrivance i dare to hope if there did it had it not to induce lady beauchamp to do a right a kind an obliging thing let me my dearest lady beauchamp said sir harry let me request at your request sir harry but not at sir charless this is noble said i i thank you madam for the absent youth both husband and son will think themselves favoured by you and the more as i am sure that you will by the cheerful welcome which you will give the young man shew that it is a sincere compliment that you have made to sir harry this man has a strange way of flattering one into acts of of what shall i call them but sir harry mr beauchamp must not i believe live with us sir harry hesitated i was afraid of opening the wound i have a request to make to you both said i it is this that mr beauchamp may be permitted to live with me and attend you madam and his father as a visitor at your own command my sister i believe will be very soon married to lord g that is to be certainly so interrupted the lady it is madam but what shall we say my dear resumed sir harry dont fly out again as to the provision for my son two hundred a year what is two hundred a year why then let it be three answered she i have a handsome and improvable estate said i i have no demands but those of reason upon me i would not offer a plea for his coming to england and i am sure he would not have come if i had without his fathers consent in which madam he hoped for yours you shall not sir allow him either the two or three hundred a year see him with love with indulgence he will deserve both and think not of any thing else for my beauchamp there is no bearing this my dear said sir harry leaning upon his ladys shoulder as he sat tears in his eyes my son is already as i have heard greatly obliged to this his true friend do you do you madam answer for me and for yourself she was overcome yet pride had its share with generosity you are said she the grandison i have heard of but i will not be under obligations to you not pecuniary ones however no sir harry recall your son i will trust to your love do for him what you please let him be independent on this insolent man she said this with a smile that made it obliging and if we are to be visitors friends neighbours let it be on an equal foot and let him have nothing to reproach us with i was agreeably surprised at this emanation shall i call it of goodness she is really not a bad woman but a perverse one in short one of those whose passions when rightly touched are liable to sudden and surprising turns generous charming lady beauchamp said i now are you the woman whom i have so often heard praised for many good qualities now will the portrait be a just one sir harry was in raptures but had like to have spoiled all by making me a compliment on the force of example be this said i the result mr beauchamp comes over he will be pleased with whatever you do at your feet madam he shall acknowledge your favour my home shall be his if you permit it on me he shall confer obligations from you he shall receive them if any considerations of family prudence there are such and very just ones restrain you from allowing him at present what your generosity would wish to do lady beauchamps colour was heightened she interrupted me we are not sir charles so scanty in our fortune well my dear lady beauchamp be all that as you will not one retrospect of the past yes sir charles but there shall his allowance has been lessened for some years not from considerations of family prudence but well tis all at an end proceeded she when the young man returns you sir harry for my sake and for the sake of this strange unaccountable creature shall pay him the whole arrear now my dear lady beauchamp said i listing her hand to my lips permit me to give you joy all doubts and misgivings so triumphantly got over so solid a foundation laid for family harmony what was the moment of your nuptials to this sir harry i congratulate you you may and i believe you have been as happy as most men but now you will be still happier indeed sir harry said she you provoked me in the morning i should not else sir harry owned himself to blame and thus the ladys pride was set down softly she desired sir harry to write before the day concluded the invitation of return to mr beauchamp and to do her all the credit in it that she might claim from the last part of the conversation but not to mention any thing of the first she afterwards abated a little of this right spirit by saying i think sir harry you need not mention any thing of the arrears as i may call them but only the future a year one would surprise him a little you know and be twice thanked surprises of such a nature as this my dear dr bartlett pecuniary surprises i dont love them they are double taxes upon the gratitude of a worthy heart is it not enough for a generous mind to labour under a sense of obligation pride vainglory must be the motive of such narrowminded benefactors a truly beneficent spirit cannot take delight in beholding the quivering lip indicating the palpitating heart in seeing the downcast countenance the uplifted hands and working muscles of a fellowcreature who but for unfortunate accidents would perhaps himself have had the will with the power of shewing a more graceful benevolence i was so much afraid of hearing farther abatements of lady beauchamps goodness so willing to depart with favourable impressions of her for her own sake and at the same time so desirous to reach the hall that night that i got myself excused though with difficulty staying to dine and accepting of a dish of chocolate i parted with sir harry and my lady both in equal good humour with themselves and me could you have thought my dear friend that i should have succeeded so very happily as i have done in this affair and at one meeting i think that the father and stepmother should have the full merit with our beauchamp of a turn so unexpected let him not therefore ever see this letter that he may take his impression of the favour done him from that which sir harry will write to him my cousin grandison whom i hoped to find here left the hall on tuesday last though he knew of my intention to be down i am sorry for it poor everard he has been a great while pretty good i am afraid he will get among his old acquaintance and then we shall not hear of him for some months perhaps if you see him in town try to engage him till i return i should be glad of his company to paris if his going with me will keep him out of harms way as it is called saturday april i have had compliments sent me by many of my neighbours who had hoped i was come to reside among them they professed themselves disappointed on my acquainting them that i must go up early on monday morning i have invited myself to their saturday assembly at the bowlinggreenhouse our reverend friend mr dobson has been so good as to leave with me the sermon he is to preach tomorrow on the opening of the church it is a very good discourse i have only exceptions to three or four compliments he makes to the patron in as many different places of it i doubt not but he will have the goodness to omit them i have already looked into all that has been done in the church and all that is doing in the house and gardens when both have had the direction and inspection of my dear dr bartlett need i say that nothing could have been better halden is just arrived from my lord with a letter which has enabled me to write to lady mansfield his lordships high approbation of all our proceedings and that he intends some one early day in next week to pay to her and miss mansfield his personal compliments he has left to me the article of settlements declaring that his regard for my future interest is all that he wishes may be attended to i have therefore written as from himself that he proposes a jointure of a year pennyrents and guineas a year for her private purse and that his lordship desires that miss mansfield will make a present to her sister of whatever she may be entitled to in her own right something was mentioned to me at mansfieldhouse of a thousand pounds left to her by a godmother halden being very desirous to see his future lady i shall at his request send the letter i have written to lady mansfield by him early in the morning with a line recommending him to the notice of that lady as lord ws principal steward adieu my dear dr bartlett i have joy in the joy of all these good people if providence graciously makes me instrumental to it i look upon myself but as its instrument i hope ostentation has no share in what draws on me more thanks and praises than i love to hear lord w has a right to be made happy by his next relation if his next relation can make him so is he not my mothers brother would not her enlarged soul have rejoiced on the occasion and blessed her son for an instance of duty to her paid by his disinterested regard for her brother who my dear dr bartlett is so happy yet who in some cases so unhappy as your charles grandison letter ix miss byron to miss selby monday april the countess of d and the earl her son have but just left us the countess sent last night to let my cousin reeves know of their intended morning visit and they came together as the visit was made to my cousin i did not think myself obliged to be in waiting for them below i was therefore in my closet comforting myself with my own agreeable reflections they were there a quarter of an hour before i was sent to their talk was of me i am used to recite my own praises you know and what signifies making a parade of apologies for continuing the use i dont value myself so much as i once did on peoples favourable opinions if i had a heart in my own keeping i should be glad it was thought a good one thats all yet though it has littlenesses in it that i knew nothing of formerly i hope it is not a bad one my lord d by the whole turn of the partial conversation was led to expect a very extraordinary young woman the lady declared that she would have her talk out and hear all my two cousins were inclined to say of me before i was sent up to as i was not below when they came i was therefore to be seen only as a subject of curiosity my lord had declared it seems that he would not be denied an introduction to me by his mother but there were no thoughts of making any application to a girl whose heart was acknowledged not to be her own my lords honour would not allow of such an intention nor ought it his impatience however hastened the message to me the countess met me halfway and embraced me my lovely girl how do you my lord said she turning to the earl i need not say this is miss byron he bowed low and made me a very high compliment but it had sense in it though high and above my merits girls writing of themselves on these occasions must be disclaimers you know but my dear uncle what care i now for compliments the man from whose mouth only they could be acceptable is not at liberty to make me any the countess engaged me in an easy general conversation part of which turned upon lord and lady l miss grandison and miss jervois and how i had passed my time at colnebrook in this wintry season when there were so many diversions in town but said she you had a man with you who is the admiration of every man and woman wherever he goes is there no making an acquaintance said my lord with sir charles grandison what i hear said of him every time he is mentioned in company is enough to fire a young man with emulation i should be happy did i deserve to be thought of as a second or third man to sir charles grandison i dare say returned i your lordships acquaintance would be highly acceptable to him he is easy of access men of rank if men of merit must be of kindred and recognize one another the moment they meet but sir charles will soon leave england the fool sighed it was you may believe involuntarily i felt myself blush and was the more silly for that the countess took my hand one word with you my dear and led me out into the next room and sitting down made me sit on the same settee with her o that i could call you daughter began she at once and turning half round to me put one arm about me with her other hand taking one of mine and earnestly looking in my downcast face i was silent ah lucy had lady d been the mother of sir charles grandison with what pleasure could i have listened to her you said my dear that sir charles grandison will soon leave england and then you sighed will you be quite openhearted may i ask you a question in hope that you will i was silent yet the word yes was on my lips you have caused it to be told me that your affections are engaged this has been a cruel blow upon us my lord nevertheless has heard so much of you he is really a good young man my dear that against my advice i own he would have me introduce him into your company i see by his looks that he could admire you above all women he never was in love i should be sorry if he were disappointed in his first love i hope his promised prudence will be his guard if there be no prospect of his succeeding with you she paused i was still silent it will be a mark of your frankness of heart my dear if when you take my full meaning you prevent me speaking more than i need i would not oppress you my sweet love such a delicacy and such a frankness mingled have i never seen in young woman but tell me my dear has sir charles grandison made his addresses to you it was a grievous question for me to answer but why was it so my lucy when all the hopes i ever had proceeded from my own presumption confirmed thats true of late by his sisters partiality in my favour and when his unhappy clementina has such a preferable claim what says miss byron she says madam that she reveres lady d and will answer any questions that she puts to her however affecting sir charles grandison has not once i thought proceeded she that i never would make a second motion were the woman a princess who had confessed a prior love or even liking but the man is sir charles grandison whom all women must esteem and the woman is miss byron whom all men must love let me ask you my dear have you any expectation that the first of men i will call him so and the loveliest and most amiableminded of women can come together you sighed you know when you mentioned that sir charles was soon to leave england and you own that he has not made addresses to you dont be uneasy my love we women in these tender cases see into each others hearts from small openings look upon me as your mother what say you love your ladyship compliments me with delicacy and frankness it is too hard a question if i have any of the first to answer without blushes a young woman to be supposed to have an esteem for a man who has made no declarations and whose behaviour to her is such only as shews a politeness to which he is accustomed and only the same kind of tenderness as he shews to his sisters and whom sometimes he calls sister as if ah madam how can one answer you have answered my dear and with that delicacy and frankness too which make a principal part of your character if my son and he shall not be encouraged in his hopes if he sees you not mind as well as person with his mothers eyes should not be able to check himself by the apprehensions he has had reason for of being but a second man in the favour of the object of his wishes we my dear have our delicacies could you not allow him a second place in your favour that might in time as he should merit and as you should subdue your prepossessions give him a first hush my dear for one moment your honour your piety are my just dependence and will be his and now speak it is to me my dear speak your whole heart let not any apprehended difficulty i am a woman as well as you and prepared to indulge your goodness madam and nothing else interrupted i gives me difficulty my lord d seems to me to be a man of merit and not a disagreeable man in his person and manners what he said of sir charles grandison and of his emulation being fired by his example gave him additional merit with me he must have a good mind i wish him acquainted with sir charles for his own sake and for the sake of the world which might be benefited by his large power so happily directed but as to myself i should forfeit the character of frankness of heart which your ladyships goodness ascribes to me if i did not declare that although i cannot and i think ought not to entertain a hope with regard to sir charles grandison since there is a lady who deserved him by severe sufferings before i knew him yet is my heart so wholly attached that i cannot think it just to give the least encouragement to any other proposal you are an excellent young woman but my dear if sir charles grandison is engaged your mind will it must change few women marry their first loves your heart o madam it is already a wedded heart it is wedded to his merits his merits will be always the object of my esteem i can never think of any other as i ought to think of the man to whom i give my hand like merits my dear as person is not the principal motive may produce like attachments my lord d will be in your hands another sir charles grandison how good you are my dear lady d but allow me to repeat as the strongest expression i can use because i mean it to carry in it all the force that can be given it that my heart is already a wedded heart you have spoken with great force god bless you my dear as i love you the matter shall take its course if my lord should happen to be a single man some time hence and i can tell you that your excellencies will make our choice difficult and if your mind from any accident or from persuasion of friends should then have received alteration you may still be happy in each other i will therefore only thank you for that openness of heart which must set free the heart of my son had you had the least lurking inclination to coquetry and could have taken pride in conquests he might have been an undone man we will return to the company but spare him my dear you must not talk much he will love you if you do too fervently for his own peace try to be a little awkward i am afraid for him indeed i am o that you had never seen sir charles grandison i could not answer one word she took my hand and led me into the company had i been silent when my lord directed his discourse to me or answered only no or yes the countess would have thought me very vain and that i ascribed to myself the consequence she so generously gave me with respect to my lord i therefore behaved and answered unaffectedly but avoided such a promptness of speech as would have looked like making pretensions to knowledge and opinion though some of my lords questions were apparently designed to engage me into freedom of discourse the countess observed me narrowly she whispered to me that she did and made me a very high compliment on my behaviour how much lucy do i love and reverence her my lord was spoken too slightly of by miss grandison in a former conversation he is really a fine gentleman any woman who is not engaged in her affections may think herself very happy with him his conversation was easy and polite and he said nothing that was low or trifling indeed lucy i think mr greville and mr fenwick are as greatly inferior to lord d as lord d is to sir charles grandison at parting he requested of me to be allowed to repeat his visits my lord said the countess before i could answer you must not expect a mere stiff maiden answer from miss byron she is above all vulgar forms she and her cousins have too much politeness and i will venture to say discernment not to be glad of your acquaintance as an acquaintance but for the rest you must look to your heart i shall be afraid said he turning to the countess to ask your ladyship for an explanation miss byron i hope sir addressing himself to mr reeves will not refuse me her company when i pay you my compliments then turning to me i hope madam i shall not be punished for admiring you my lord d replied i will be entitled to every civility i had said more had he not snatched my hand a little too eagerly and kissed it and thus much for the visit of the countess of d and the earl did i tell you in my former letter that emily is with me half her time she is a most engaging young creature her manners are so pure her heart is so sincere and open o lucy you would dearly love her i wish i may be asked to carry her down with me yet she adores her guardian but her reverence for him will not allow of the innocent familiarity in thinking of him that i dont know what i would say but to love with an ardor that would be dangerous to ones peace one must have more tenderness than reverence for the object dont you think so lucy miss grandison made me one of her flying visits as she calls them soon after the countess and my lord went away mr and mrs reeves told her all that had been said before them by the earl and countess as well before i went down to them as after they could not tell her what passed between that lady and me when she took me aside i had not had time to tell them they referred to me for that but besides that i was not in spirits and cared not to say much i was not willing to be thought by my refusal of so great an offer to seem to fasten myself upon her brother she pitied who but must lady clementina she pitied her brother also and seeing me dejected she clasped her arms about me and wet my cheek with a sisterly tear is it not very strange lucy that his father should keep him so long abroad these freeliving men of what absurdities are they not guilty what misfortunes to others do they not occasion one might with the excellent clementina ask what had mr grandison to do in italy or why if he must go abroad did he stay so long travelling young men travelling i cannot my dear but think it a very nonsensical thing what can they see but the ruins of the gay once busy world of which they have read to see a parcel of giddy boys under the direction of tutors or governors hunting after what nothing or at best but ruins of ruins for the imagination aided by reflection must be left after all to make out the greater glories which the gravedigger time has buried too deep for discovery and when this grand tour is completed the travelled youth returns and what is his boast why to be able to tell perhaps his better taught friend who has never been out of his native country that he has seen in ruins what the other has a juster idea of from reading and of which it is more than probable he can give a much better account than the traveller and are these petulant harriet methinks lucy you demand all the benefits that you will suppose sir charles grandison has reaped from his travelling why no but then in turn i ask is every traveller a sir charles grandison and does not even he confess to dr bartlett that he wished he had never seen italy and may not the poor clementina and all her family for her sake wish he never had if an opportunity offers i dont know but i may ask sir charles whether in his conscience he thinks that taking in every consideration relating to time expense risques of life health morals this part of the fashionable education of youth of condition is such an indispensable one as some seem to suppose it if sir charles grandison give it not in favour of travelling i believe it will be concluded that six parts out of eight of the little masters who are sent abroad for improvement might as well be kept at home if especially they would be orderly and let their fathers and mothers know what to do with them o my uncle i am afraid of you but spare the poor girl she acknowledges her petulance her presumption the occasion you know and will pity her for it however neither petulance nor presumption shall make her declare as her sentiments what really are not so in her unprejudiced hours and she hopes to have her heart always open to conviction for the present adieu my lucy ps dr bartlett tells me that mr beauchamp is at calais waiting the pleasure of his father and that sir harry has sent express for him as at his ladys motion letter x miss byron in continuation tuesday april sir charles grandison came to town last night he was so polite as to send to inquire after my health and to let mr reeves know that he would do himself the honour as he called it of breakfasting with him this morning very ceremonious either for his own sake or for mine perhaps for both so i am in expectation of seeing within this halfhour the noble clementinas future ah lucy the compliment you see is to mr reeves shall i stay above and see if he will ask for me he owes me something for the emotion he gave me in lord ls library very little of him since have i seen honour forbids me said he then yet honour bids me but i cannot be ungenerous selfish these words are still in my ear what could he mean by them honour forbids me what to explain himself he had been telling me a tender tale he had ended it what did honour forbid him to do yet honour bids me why then did he not follow the dictates of honour but i cannot be unjust to clementina he means who wished him to be so unjust i hope not it is a diminution to your glory sir charles grandison to have the word unjust in this way of speaking in your thoughts as if a good man had lain under a temptation to be unjust and had but just recollected himself i cannot be ungenerous to the noble lady i suppose he must take compassion on her and did he think himself under an obligation to my forwardness to make this declaration to me as to one who wished him to be ungenerous to such a lady for my sake i cannot bear the thought of this is it not as if he had said fond harriet i see what you expect from me but i must have compassion for i cannot be ungenerous to clementina but what a poor word is compassion noble clementina i grieve for you though the man be indeed a generous man o defend me my better genius from wanting the compassion even of a sir charles grandison but what means he by the word selfish he cannot be selfish i comprehend not the meaning of this word clementina has a very high fortune harriet but a very middling one he cannot be unjust ungenerous to clementina nor yet selfish this word confounds me from a man that says nothing at random well but breakfasttime is come while i am busy in selfdebatings i will go down that i may not seem to affect parade i will endeavour to see with indifference him that we have all been admiring and studying for this last fortnight in such a variety of lights the christian the hero the friend ah lucy the lover of clementina the generous kinsman of lord w the modest and delicate benefactor of the mansfields the free gay raillier of lady beauchamp and in her of all our sexs foibles but he is come while i am prating to you with my pen he is come why lucy would you detain me now must the fool go down in a kind of hurry yet stay till she is sent for and that is now letter xi miss byron in continuation o lucy i have such a conversation to relate to you but let me lead to it sir charles met me at the opening of the door he was all himself such an unaffected modesty and politeness yet such an ease and freedom i thought by his address that he would have taken my hand and both hands were so emulatively passive how does he manage it to be so free in a first address yet so respectful that a princess could not blame him after breakfast my cousins being sent for out to attend sir john allestree and his niece sir charles and i were left alone and then with an air equally solemn and free he addressed himself to me the last time i had the honour of being alone with my good miss byron i told her a very tender tale i was sure it would raise in such a heart as hers generous compassion for the noblest lady on the continent and i presumed as my difficulties were not owing either to rashness or indiscretion that she would also pity the relater the story did indeed affect you yet for my own sake as well as yours i referred you to dr bartlett for the particulars of some parts of it upon which i could not expatiate the doctor madam has let me know the particulars which he communicated to you i remember with pain the pain i gave to your generous heart in lord ls study i am sure you must have suffered still more from the same compassionate goodness on the communications he made you may i madam however add a few particulars to the same subject which he then could not give you now you have been let into so considerable a part of my story i am desirous to acquaint you and that rather than any woman in the world with all that i know myself of this arduous affair he ceased speaking i was in tremors sir sir the story i must own is a most affecting one how much is the unhappy lady to be pitied you will do me honour in acquainting me with further particulars of it dr bartlett has told you madam that the bishop of nocera second brother to lady clementina has very lately written to me requesting that i will make one more visit to bologna i have the letter you read italian madam shall i or will you he held it to me i took it these lucy are the contents the bishop acquaints him with the very melancholy way they are in the father and mother declining in their healths signor jeronymo worse than when sir charles left them his sister also declining in her health yet earnest still to see him he says that she is at present at urbino but is soon to go to naples to the generals he urges him to make them one visit more yet owns that his family are not unanimous in the request but that he and father marescotti and the marchioness are extremely earnest that this indulgence should be granted to the wishes of his dear sister he offers to meet him at his own appointment and conduct him to bologna where he tells him his presence will rejoice every heart and procure an unanimous consent to the interview so much desired and says that if this measure which he is sorry he has so long withstood answers not his hopes he will advise the shutting up of their clementina in a nunnery or to consign her to private hands where she shall be treated kindly but as persons in her unhappy circumstances are accustomed to be treated sir charles then shewed me a letter from signor jeronymo in which he acquaints him with the dangerous way he is in he tells him that his life is a burden to him he wishes it was brought to its period he does not think himself in skilful hands he complains most of the wound which is in his hipjoint and which has hitherto baffled the art both of the italian and french surgeons who have been consulted he wishes that himself and sir charles had been of one country he says since the greatest felicity he now has to wish for is to yield up his life to the giver of it in the arms of his grandison he mentions not one word in this melancholy letter of his unhappy sister which sir charles accounted for by supposing that she not being at bologna they kept from him in his deplorable way everything relating to her that was likely to disturb him he then read part of a letter written in english by the admired mrs beaumont some of the contents of which were as you shall hear extremely affecting mrs beaumont gives him in it an account of the situation of the unhappy young lady and excuses herself for not having done it before in answer to his request by reason of an indisposition under which she had for some time laboured which had hindered her from making the necessary inquiries she mentions that the lady had received no benefit from her journeyings from place to place and from her voyage from leghorn to naples and back again and blames her attendants who to quiet her unknown to their principals for some time kept her in expectation of seeing her chevalier at the end of each for her more prudent camilla she says had been hindered by illness from attending her in several of the excursions they had a second time at her own request put her into a nunnery she at first was so sedate in it as gave them hopes but the novelty going off and one of the sisters to try her having officiously asked her to go with her into the parlour where she said she would be allowed to converse through the grate with a certain english gentleman her impatience on her disappointment made her more ungovernable than they had ever known her for she had been for two hours before meditating what she would say to him for a week together she was vehemently intent upon being allowed to visit england and had engaged her cousins sebastiano and juliano to promise to escort her thither if she could obtain leave her mother brought her off this when nobody else could only by entreating her for her sake never to think of it more the marchioness then encouraged by this instance of her obedience took her under her own care but the young lady going on from flight to slight and the way she was in visibly affecting the health of her indulgent mother a doctor was found who was absolutely of opinion that nothing but harsh methods would avail and in this advice lady sforza and her daughter laurana and the general concurring she was told that she must prepare to go to milan she was so earnest to be excused from going thither and to be permitted to go to florence to mrs beaumont that they gave way to her entreaties and the marquis himself accompanying her to florence prevailed on mrs beaumont to take her under her care with her she staid three weeks she was tolerably sedate in that space of time but most so when she was talking of england and of the chevalier grandison and his sisters with whom she wished to be acquainted she delighted to speak english and to talk of the tenderness and goodness of her tutor and of what he said to her upon such and such a subject at the three weeks end the general made her a visit in company of lady sforza and her talk being all on this subject they were both highly displeased and hinted that she was too much indulged in it and unhappily she repeating some tender passages that passed in the interview her mother had permitted her to hold with the chevalier the general would have it that mr grandison had designedly from the first sought to give himself consequence with her and expressed himself on the occasion with great violence against him he carried his displeasure to extremity and obliged her to go away with his aunt and him that very day to her great regret and as much to the regret of mrs beaumont and of the ladies her friends who tenderly loved the innocent visionary as sometimes they called her and mrs beaumont is sure that the gentle treatment she met with from them would in time though perhaps slowly have greatly helped her mrs beaumont then gives an account of the harsh treatment the poor young lady met with sir charles grandison would have stopt reading here he said he could not read it to me without such a change of voice as would add to my pain as well as to his own tears often stole down my cheeks when i read the letters of the bishop and signor jeronymo and as sir charles read a part of mrs beaumonts letter and i doubted not but what was to follow would make them flow yet i said be pleased sir to let me read on i am not a stranger to distress i can pity others or i should not deserve pity myself he pointed to the place and withdrew to the window mrs beaumont says that the poor mother was prevailed upon to resign her child wholly to the management of lady sforza and her daughter laurana who took her with them to their palace in milan the tender parent however besought them to spare all unnecessary severity which they promised but laurana objected to camillas attendance she was thought too indulgent and her servant laura as a more manageable person was taken in her place and o how cruelly as you shall hear did they treat her father marescotti being obliged to visit a dying relation at milan was desired by the marchioness to inform himself of the way her beloved daughter was in and of the methods taken with her lady laurana having in her letters boasted of both the good father acquainted mrs beaumont with the following particulars he was surprised to find a difficulty made of his seeing the lady but insisting on it he found her to be wholly spiritless and in terror afraid to speak afraid to look before her cousin laurana yet seeming to want to complain to him he took notice of this to laurana o father said she we are in the right way i assure you when we had her first her chevalier and an interview with him were ever in her mouth but now she is in such order that she never speaks a word of him but what asked the compassionate father must she have suffered to be brought to this dont you father trouble yourself about that replied the cruel laurana the doctors have given their opinion that some severity was necessary it is all for her good the poor lady expressed herself to him with earnestness after the veil a subject on which it seems they indulged her urging that the only way to secure her health of mind if it could be restored was to yield to her wishes lady sforza said that it was not a point that she herself would press but it was her opinion that her family sinned in opposing a divine dedication and perhaps their daughters malady might be a judgment upon them for it the father in his letter to mrs beaumont ascribes to lady sforza selfinterested motives for her conduct to laurana envy on account of lady clementinas superior qualities but nobody he says till now doubted lauranas love of her father marescotti then gives a shocking instance of the barbarous lauranas treatment of the noble sufferer all for her good wretch how my heart rises against her her servant laura under pretence of confessing to her bologna father in tears acquainted him with it it was perpetrated but the day before when any severity was to be exercised upon the unhappy lady laura was always shut out of her apartment her lady had said something that she was to be chidden for lady sforza who was not altogether so severe as her daughter was not at home laura listened in tears she heard laurana in great wrath with lady clementina and threaten her and her young lady break out to this effect what have i done to you laurana to be so used you are not the cousin laurana you used to be you know i am not able to help myself why do you call me crazy and frantic laurana vile upbraider lucy if the almighty has laid his hand upon me should i not be pitied it is all for your good it is all for your good clementina you could not always have spoken so sensibly cousin cruel laurana you loved me once i have no mother as you have my mother was a good mother but she is gone or i am gone i know not which she threatened her then with the strait waistcoat a punishment which the unhappy lady was always greatly terrified at laura heard her beg and pray but laurana coming out she was forced to retire the poor young lady apprehending her cruel cousins return with the threatened waistcoat and with the woman that used to be brought in when they were disposed to terrify her went down and hid herself under a staircase where she was soon discovered by her clothes which she had not been careful to draw in after her o lucy how i wept how insupportable to me said sir charles would have been my reflections had my conscience told me that i had been the wilful cause of the noble clementinas calamity after i had a little recovered i read to myself the next paragraph which related that the cruel laurana dragged the sweet sufferer by her gown from her hidingplace inveighing against her threatening her she all patient resigned her hands crossed on her bosom praying for ercy not by speech but by her eyes which however wept not and causing her to be carried up to her chamber there punished her with the strait waistcoat as she had threatened father marescotti was greatly affected with lauras relation as well as with what he had himself observed but on his return to bologna dreading to acquaint her mother for her own sake with the treatment her clementina met with he only said he did not quite approve of it and advised her not to oppose the young ladys being brought home if the bishop and the general came into it but he laid the whole matter before the bishop who wrote to the general to join with him out of hand to release their sister from her present bondage and the general meeting the bishop on a set day at milan for that purpose the lady was accordingly released a breach ensued upon it with lady sforza and her daughter who would have it that clementina was much better for their management they had by terror broke her spirit and her passiveness was reckoned upon as an indication of amendment the marchioness being much indisposed the young lady attended by her camilla was carried to naples where it is supposed she now is poor young lady how has she been hurried about but who can think of her cousin laurana without extreme indignation mrs beaumont writes that the bishop would fain have prevailed upon his brother the general to join with him in an invitation to sir charles grandison to come over as a last expedient before they locked her up either in a nunnery or in some private house but the general would by no means come into it he asked what was proposed to be the end of sir charless visit were all that was wished from it to follow in his sisters restored mind he never he said would give his consent that she should be the wife of an english protestant the bishop declared that he was far from wishing her to be so but he was for leaving that to afterconsideration could they but restore his sister to her reason that reason cooperating with her principles might answer all their hopes he might try his expedient the general said with all his heart but he looked upon the chevalier grandison to be a man of art and he was sure he must have entangled his sister by methods imperceptible to her and to them but yet more efficacious to his ends than an open declaration had he not he asked found means to fascinate olivia and as many women as he came into company with for his part he loved not the chevalier he had forced him by his intrepidity to be civil to him but forced civility was but a temporary one it was his way to judge of causes by the effects and this he knew that he had lost a sister who would have been a jewel in the crown of a prince and would not be answerable for consequences if he and sir charles grandison were once more to meet be it where it would father marescotti however joining as the bishop writes with him and the marchioness in a desire to try this expedient and being sure that the marquis and signor jeronymo would not be averse to it he took a resolution to write over to him as has been related this lucy is the state of the unhappy case as briefly and as clearly as my memory will serve to give it and what a rememberer if i may make a word is the heart not a circumstance escapes it and now it remained for me to know of sir charles what answer he had returned was not my situation critical my dear had sir charles asked my opinion before he had taken his resolutions i should have given it with my whole heart that he should fly to the comfort of the poor lady but then he would have shewn a suspense unworthy of clementina and a compliment to me which a good man so circumstanced ought not to make my regard for him yet what a poor affected word is regard was nevertheless as strong as ever generosity or rather justice to clementina and that so often avowed regard to him pulled my heart two ways i wanted to consider with myself for a few moments i was desirous to clear the conduct that i was to shew on this trying occasion as well of precipitance as of affectation and my cousin reeves just then coming in for something she wanted i took the opportunity to walk to the other end of the room and while a short complimental discourse passed between them harriet byron said i to myself be not mean hast thou not the example of a clementina before thee her religion and her love combating together have overturned the noble creatures reason tho canst not be called to such a trial but canst thou not shew that if thou wert thou couldst have acted greatly if not so greatly sir charles grandison is just he ought to prefer to thee the excellent clementina priority of claim compassion for the noble sufferer merits so superior i love him for his merits shall i not love merits nearly as great in one of my own sex the struggle will cost thee something but go down and try to be above thyself banished to thy retirement to thy pillow thought i be all the girl often have i contended for the dignity of my sex let me now be an example to myself and not unworthy in my own eyes when i come to reflect of an union could it have been effected with a man whom a clementina looked up to with hope my cousin being withdrawn and sir charles approaching me i attempted to assume a dignity of aspect without pride and i spoke while spirit was high in me and to keep myself up to it my heart bleeds sir for the distresses of your clementina yes lucy i said your clementina beyond expression i admire the greatness of her behaviour and most sincerely lament her distresses what that is in the power of man cannot sir charles grandison do you have honoured me sir with the title of sister in the tenderness of that relation permit me to say that i dread the effects of the generals petulance i feel next for you the pain that it must give to your humane heart to be once more personally present to the woes of the inimitable clementina but i am sure you did not hesitate a moment about leaving all your friends here in england and resolving to hasten over to try at least what can be done for the noble sufferer had he praised me highly for this my address to him it would have looked such was the situation on both sides as if he had thought this disinterested behaviour in me an extraordinary piece of magnanimity and selfdenial and of consequence as if he had supposed i had views upon him which he wondered i could give up his is the most delicate of human minds he led me to my seat and taking his by me still holding my passive hand ever since i have had the honour of miss byrons acquaintance i have considered her as one of the most excellent of women my heart demands alliance with hers and hopes to be allowed its claim though such are the delicacies of situation that i scarcely dare to trust myself to speak upon the subject from the first i called miss byron my sister but she is more to me than the dearest sister and there is a more tender friendship that i aspire to hold with her whatever may be the accidents on either side to bar a further wish and this i must hope that she will not deny me so long as it shall be consistent with her other attachments he paused i made an effort to speak but speech was denied me my face as i felt glowed like the fire before me my heart resumed he is ever on my lips it is tortured when i cannot speak all that is in it professions i am not accustomed to make as i am not conscious of being unworthy of your friendship i will suppose it and further talk to you of my affairs and engagements as that tender friendship may warrant sir you do me honour was all i could say i had a letter from the faithful camilla i hold not a correspondence with her but the treatment that her young lady met with of which she had got some general intimations and some words that the bishop said to her which expressed his wishes that i would make them one more visit at bologna urged her to write begging of me for heavens sake to go over but unless one of the family had written to me and by consent of others of it what hope had i of a welcome after i had been as often refused as i had requested while i was in italy to be admitted to the presence of the lady who was so desirous of one interview more especially as mrs beaumont gave me no encouragement to go but the contrary from what she observed of the inclinations of the family mrs beaumont is still of opinion as in the conclusion of the letter before you that i should not go unless the general and the marquis join their requests to those of the marchioness the bishop and father marescotti but i had no sooner perused the bishops letter than i wrote that i would most cheerfully comply with his wishes but that i should be glad that i might not be under any obligation to go further than bologna where i might have the happiness to attend my jeronymo as well as his sister i had a little twitch at my heart lucy i was sorry for it but my judgment was entirely with him and now madam you will wonder that you see not any preparations for my departure all is prepared i only wait for the company of one gentleman who is settling his affairs with all expedition to go with me he is an able a skilful surgeon who has had great practice abroad and in the armies and having acquired an easy fortune is come to settle in his native country my jeronymo expresses himself dissatisfied with his surgeons if mr lowther can be of service to him how happy shall i think myself and if my presence can be a means to restore the noble clementina but how dare i hope it and yet i am persuaded that in her case and with such a temper of mind unused to hardship and opposition as she had been the only way to recover her would have been by complying with her in every thing that her heart or head was earnestly set upon for what controul was necessary to a young lady who never even in the height of her malady uttered a wish or thought that was contrary to her duty either to god or her parents nor yet to the honour of her name and allow me madam to say to the pride of her sex i am under an obligation to go to paris proceeded he from the will of my late friend mr danby i shall stop there for a day or two only in order to put things in a way for my last hand on my return from italy when i am in italy i shall perhaps be enabled to adjust two or three accounts that stand out in relation to the affairs of my ward this day at dinner i shall see mrs oldham and her sons and in the afternoon at tea mrs ohara and her husband and captain salmonet tomorrow i hope for the honour of your company madam and mr and mrs reevess at dinner and be so good as to engage them for the rest of the day you must not deny me because i shall want your influence upon charlotte to make her fix lord gs happy day that i may be able to see their hands united before i set out as my return will be uncertain ah lucy more twitches just then thursday next is the day fixed for the triple marriage of the danbys i have promised to give miss danby to mr galliard and to dine with them and their friends at enfield if i can see my lord w and charlotte happy before i go i shall be highly gratified it is another of my wishes to see my friend beauchamp in england first and to leave him in possession of his fathers love and of his motherinlaws civility dr bartlett and he will be happy in each other i shall correspond with the doctor he greatly admires you madam and will communicate to you all you shall think worthy of your notice relating to the proceedings of a man who will always think himself honoured by your inquiries after him ah lucy sir charles grandison then sighed he seemed to look more than he spoke i will not promise for my heart if he treats me with more than the tenderness of friendship if he gives me room to think that he wishes but what can he wish he ought to be he must be clementinas and i will endeavour to make myself happy if i can maintain the second place in his friendship and when he offers me this shall i lucy be so little as to be displeased with the man who cannot be to me all that i had once hoped he could be no he shall be the same glorious creature in my eyes i will admire his goodness of heart and greatness of mind and i will think him entitled to my utmost gratitude for the protection he gave me from a man of violence and for the kindness he has already shewn me is not friendship the basis of my love and does he not tender me that nevertheless at the time do what i could i found a tear ready to start my heart was very untoward lucy and i was guilty of a little female turn when i found the twinkling of my eyes would not disperse the too ready drop and felt it stealing down my cheek i wiped it off the poor emily said i she will be grieved at parting with you emily loves her guardian and i love my ward i once had a thought madam of begging your protection of emily but as i have two sisters i think she will be happy under their wings and in the protection of my good lord l and the rather as i have no doubt of overcoming her unhappy mother by making her husbands interest a guaranty for her tolerable if not good behaviour to her child i was glad to carry my thoughts out of myself as i may say and from my own concerns we all sir said i look upon mr beauchamp as a future husband for emily madam interrupted he it must not be at my motion my friend shall be entitled to share with me my whole estate but i will never seek to lead the choice of my ward let emily some time hence find out the husband she can be happy with beauchamp the wife he can love emily if i can help it shall not be the wife of any mans convenience beauchamp is nice and i will be as nice for my ward and the more so as i hope she herself wants not delicacy there is a cruelty in persuasion where the heart rejects the person proposed whether the urger be parent or guardian lord bless me thought i what a man is this do you expect mr beauchamp soon sir every day madam and is it possible sir that you can bring all these things to bear before you leave england and go so soon i fear nothing but charlottes whimsies have you madam any reason to apprehend that she is averse to an alliance with lord g his father and aunt are very importunate for an early celebration none at all sir then i shall depend much upon yours and lord and lady ls influence over her he besought my excuse for detaining my attention so long upon his motion to go my two cousins came in he took even a solemn leave of me and a very respectful one of them i had kept up my spirits to their utmost stretch i besought my cousins to excuse me for a few minutes his departure from me was too solemn and i hurried up to my closet and after a few involuntary sobs a flood of tears relieved me i besought on my knees peace to the disturbed mind of the excellent clementina calmness and resignation to my own and safety to sir charles and then drying my eyes at the glass i went down stairs to my cousins and on their inquiries with looks of deep concern after the occasion of my red eyes i said all is over all is over my dear cousins i cannot blame him he is all that is noble and good i can say no more just now the particulars you shall have from my pen i went up stairs to write and except for one half hour at dinner and another at tea i stopt not till i had done and here quite tired uneasy vexed with myself yet hardly knowing why i lay down my pen take what i have written cousin reeves if you can read it do and then dispatch it to my lucy but on second thoughts i will shew it to the two ladies and lord l before it is sent away they will be curious to know what passed in a conversation where the critical circumstances both of us were in required a delicacy which i am not sure was so well observed on my side as on his i shall i know have their pity but let nobody who pities not the noble clementina shew any for harriet byron letter xii miss byron in continuation tuesday night april miss grandison came to me just as we had supped she longed she said to see me but was prevented coming before and desired to know what had passed between her brother and me this morning i gave her the letter which i had but a little while before concluded he had owned she said that he had breakfasted with me and spoke of me to her and lord and lady l with an ardor that gave them pleasure she put my letter into her bosom i may i hope harriet if you please madam said i if you please madam repeated she and with that dolorous accent too my harriet my sister and i have been in tears this morning lord l had much ado to forbear sir charles will soon leave us it cant be helped charlotte did you dine today in st jamesssquare no indeed my brother had a certain tribe with him and the woman also it is very difficult i believe harriet for good people to forbear doing sometimes more than goodness requires of them could you not charlotte have sat at table with them for one hour or two my brother did not ask me he did not expect it he gives every body their choice you know he told me last night who were to dine with him today and supposed i would choose to dine with lady l or with you he was so free as to say he did us an honour which you thought too great a one but if he had asked you charlotte then i should have bridled indeed i asked him if he did not overdo it what was his answer perhaps he might but i said he may never see mrs oldham again i want to inform myself of her future intentions with a view overdo it again charlotte to make her easy and happy for life her children are in the world i want to give her a credit that will make her remembered by them as they grow up with duty i hope i am superior to forms she is conscious i can pity her she is a gentlewoman and entitled to a place at any mans table to whom she never was a servant she never was mine and what miss grandison could you say in answer asked i what why i put up my lip ungracious girl i cant help it that may become a man to do in such cases as this that would not a woman sir charles wants not delicacy my dear said i he must suppose that i should have sat swelling and been reserved he was right not to ask me so be quiet harriet and yet perhaps you would be as tame to a husbands mistress as you seem favourable to a fathers she then put on one of her arch looks the cases differ charlotte but do you know what passed between the generous man and the mortified woman and her children mortified as they must be by his goodness yes yes i had curiosity enough to ask dr bartlett about it all pray charlotte dr bartlett is favourable to every body sinners as well as saints he began with praising the modesty of her dress the humility of her behaviour he said that she trembled and looked down till she was reassured by sir charles such creatures have all their tricks harriet you charlotte are not favourable to sinners and hardly to saints but pray proceed why he reassured the woman as i told you and then proceeded to ask many questions of the elder oldham i pitied that young fellow to have a mother in his eye whose very tenderness to the young ones kept alive the sense of her guilt and yet what would she have been had she not been doubly tender to the innocents who were born to shame from her fault the young man acknowledged a military genius and sir charles told him that he would on his return from a journey he was going to take consider whether he could not do him service in the way he chose he gave him it seems a brief lecture on what he should aim to be and what avoid to qualify himself for a man of true honour and spoke very handsomely of such gentlemen of the army as are real gentlemen the young fellow continued miss grandison may look upon himself to be as good as provided for since my brother never gives the most distant hope that is not followed by absolute certainty the first opportunity not that offers but which he can make he took great notice of the little boys he dilated their hearts and set them a prating and was pleased with their prate the doctor who had never seen him before in the company of children applauded him for his vivacity and condescending talk to them the tenderest father in the world he said could not have behaved more tenderly or shewed himself more delighted with his own children than he did with those brats of mrs oldham ah charlotte and is it out of doubt that you are the daughter of lady grandison and sister of sir charles grandison well but i believe you are some children take after the father some after the mother forgive me my dear but i wont i have a great mind to quarrel with you harriet pray dont because i could neither help nor can be sorry for what i said but pray proceed why he made presents to the children i dont know what they were nor could the doctor tell me i suppose very handsome ones for he has the spirit of a prince he inquired very particularly after the circumstances of the mother and was more kind to her than many people would be to their own mothers he can account for this i suppose though i cannot the woman it is true is of a good family and so forth but that enhances her crime natural children abound in the present age keeping is fashionable good men should not countenance such wretches but my brother and you are charitable creatures with all my heart child virtue however has at least as much to say on one side of the question as on the other when the poor children are in the world as your brother said when the poor women are penitents true penitents your brothers treatment of mrs giffard was different he is in both instances an imitator of the almighty a humbler of the impenitent and an encourager of those who repent well well he is undoubtedly a good sort of young man and harriet you are a good sort of young woman where much is given much is required but i have not given me such a large quantity of charity as either of you may boast and how can i help it but however the woman went away blessing and praising him and that the doctor says more with her eyes than she was able to do in words the elder youth departed in rapturous reverence the children hung about his knees on theirs the doctor will have it that it was without bidding perhaps so he raised them by turns to his arms and kissed them why harriet your eyes glisten child they would have run over i suppose had you been there is it that your heart is weakened with your present situation i hope not no you are a good creature and i see that the mention of a behaviour greatly generous however slightly made will have its force upon a heart so truly benevolent as yours you must be lady grandison my dear indeed you must well but i must be gone you dine with us tomorrow my brother says he did ask me and desired me to engage my cousins but he repeated not the invitation when he went away he depends upon your coming and so do we he is to talk to me before you it seems i cant tell about what but by his hurrying on every thing it is plain he is preparing to leave us he is madam he is madam and with that dejected air and mendicant voice speak up like a woman the sooner he sets out if he must go the sooner he will return come come harriet you shall be lady grandison still ah and that sigh too these lovesick folks have a language that nobody else can talk to them in and then she affectedly sighed is that right harriet she sighed again no it is not i never knew what a sigh was but when my father vexed my sister and that was more for fear he should one day be as cruel to me than for her sake we can be very generous for others harriet when we apprehend that one day we may want the same pity ourselves our best passions my dear have their mixtures of selflove you have drawn a picture of human nature charlotte that i dont like it is a likeness for all that she arose snatched my hand hurried to the door be with us harriet and cousin reeves and cousin reeves as soon as you can tomorrow i want to talk to you my dear to me of an hundred thousand things before dinner remember we dine early away she fluttered happy miss grandison what charming spirits she has letter xiii miss byron in continuation wednesday april miss jervois came to me this morning by six impatient as she said to communicate good news to me i was in my closet writing i could not sleep i have seen my mother said she and we are good friends was she ever unkind to me madam dear creature said i and clasped her to my bosom you are a sweet girl oblige me with the particulars let me lucy give you as near as i can recollect the amiable young creatures words and actions on this occasion sit down my love said i what when i am talking of a reconciled mother and to dear miss byron no indeed she often held out one open hand while the forefinger of the other in full action patted it as at other times both were spread with pretty wonder and delight and thus she began why you must know it was about six oclock yesterday afternoon that my mother and her husband and captain salmonet came i was told of their visit but two hours before and when the coach stopped and i at the window saw them alight i thought i should have fainted away i would have given half i was worth in the world to have been an hundred miles off dr bartlett was there and received them my guardian was unexpectedly engaged in answering a letter sent him by lord w for which a gentleman waited but they had not been there a quarter of an hour when he entered and made apologies to them in his usual gracious manner never the doctor says did any body look so respectful as the major and the captain and they would have made apologies to my guardian for their last behaviour to him but he would not let them and my mother the doctor says from the very first behaved prettily the moment she asked for me my guardian himself condescended to come up to me and took my hand was not that very good of him my dear said he as he led me down stairs and spoke so kindly dont tremble so am i not with you your mother is very calm and composed you must ask her blessing i shall ease your tender heart of every pang i shall hint to you what to do and how to behave to the gentlemen as occasions arise he had no sooner said the words but the drawingroom door gave way to his hand and i was in the room with him down on my knees dropt i as i now do to you but i could not speak thus i did and she kissed my hand and bowed her face upon it and my mother raised me you must raise me madam yes just so and she kissed me too and wept on my neck and called me pretty names and encouraged me and said she loved me as she loved her own soul and i was encouraged my guardian then with the air and manner of a gracious prince took my hand and presented it first to the major then to the captain and they each kissed my hand and spoke in my praise i cant tell how many fine things major said my guardian when he presented me to him you must excuse the dear childs weakness of spirits she wishes you all happiness on your nuptials she has let me know that she is very desirous to do you service for her mothers sake the major swore by his soul i was an angel captain salmonet said that by his salvation i was a charming young lady my mother wept o sir said she to my guardian and dropping down in a chair by the window not a word more could she speak i ran to her and clasped my arms about her she wept the more i wiped her eyes with her own handkerchief i told her it went to my heart to see her cry i begged she would spare me this grief she clasped her arms then about me and kissed my cheek and my forehead o thought i it is very good of you my dear mother then came my guardian to us and he kindly took my mothers hand and conducted her to the fireside and he led me and placed me by her at the teatable and he made the major and the captain sit down by him so much graciousness in his countenance o madam i shall be an idolater i am afraid and he said emily my dear you will make tea for us my sister dined abroad madam to my mother yes sir i will said i and i was as lively as a bird but before the servants came in let me tell you madam said he what miss jervois has proposed to me they were in silent expectation she has desired that you major will accept from her for your mutual use of an additional a year which i shall order to be paid you quarterly during mrs oharas life not doubting but you will make her as happy as it is in your power to make her my mother bowed coloured with gratitude and looked obliged and she begs of you madam turning to my mother that you will accept as from the major another a year for pinmoney which he or which you madam will draw upon me for also quarterly if you choose not to trouble him to do it for this a year must be appropriated to your sole and separate use madam and not be subject to your controul major ohara good god sir said the major what a wretch was i the last time i was here there is no bearing of this he got up and went to the window and the captain said blessed jesu and something else which i could not mind for i was weeping like a baby what sir said my mother a year do you mean so i do madam and sir to be so generously paid me my of it as if i received it not from my child but from my husband good god how you overpower me sir what shame what remorse do you strike into my heart and my poor mothers tears ran down as fast as mine o madam said the dear girl to me clasping her arms about me how your tender heart is touched it is well you were not there dr bartlett came in to tea my guardian would not permit antony who offered himself to wait antony had been my own papas servant when my mother was not so good nothing but blessings nothing but looks and words of admiration and gratitude passed all the teatime how their hearts rejoiced i warrant is it not a charming thing madam to make peoples hearts glad to be sure it is how many hearts has my guardian rejoiced you must bid him be cross to me or i shall not know what to do with myself but then if he was i should only get by myself and cry and be angry with myself and think he could not be to blame o my love my emily said i take care of your gratitude that drew in your true friend well but how can it be helped madam can a right heart be ungrateful dr bartlett says there is no such thing as true happiness in this life and is it not better to be unhappy from good men and women than from bad dear madam why you have often made me unhappy because of your goodness to me and because i knew that i neither could deserve nor return it the dear prater went on my guardian called me aside when tea was over my emily said he i do love he should call me his emily but all the world is his emily i think let me see what you will do with these two notes giving me two banknotes of each present pinmoney and cash may be wanted we will suppose that your mother has been married a quarter of a year her pinmoney and the additional annuity may commence from the th of december last let me emily when they go away see the graceful manner in which you will dispose of the notes and from mr oharas behaviour upon it we shall observe whether he is a man with whom your mother if it be not her own fault now you have made it their interest to be kind to each other may live well but the motion be all your own how good this was i could have kissed the hand that gave me the notes if i thought it would not have looked too free i understand you sir said i and when they went away pouring out their very hearts in grateful joy i addressed myself to mr ohara sir said i it is proper that the payment of the additional annuity should have a commencement let it be from christmas last accept of the first payment from my own hands and i gave him one note and looking at my mother with a look of duty for fear be should mistake and discredit himself in the eyes of the deepest discerner in the world gave him the other he looked upon first one then upon the other note with surprise and then bowing to the ground to me and to my guardian he stept to my mother and presented them both to her you madam said he must speak i cannot as i ought god send me with a whole heart out of this house he hurried out and when he was in the hall wiped his eyes and sobbed like a child as one of the servants told my anne my mother looked upon one note as her husband had done and upon the other and lifting up her eyes embraced me and would have said something to my guardian but he prevented her by saying emily will be always dutiful to you madam and respectful to mr ohara may you be happy together and he led her out was ever such a condescension he led her out to her husband who being a little recovered was just about to give some money to the servant who was retiring from the offer nobody said my guardian graciously smiling pays my servants but myself mr ohara they are good people and merit my favour and he went to the very door with my mother i could not i ran back crying for joy into the drawingroom when they went out of it i could not bear myself how could i you know madam captain salmonet all the time wiped his eyes shrugged his shoulders lifted up his hands and cried out upon jesu and once or twice he crossed himself but all the time my guardian looked and acted as if those actions and praises were nothing to be proud of when he came in to me i arose and threw myself at his feet but could only say thank you sir for your goodness to my mother he raised me he sat down by me see child said he and he took my hand my heart was sensible of the favour and throbbed with joy what it is in the power of people of fortune to do you have a great one now your mother is married i have hopes of her they will at least keep up appearances to each other and to the world they neither of them want sense you have done an act of duty and benevolence both in one the man who would grudge them this additional a year out of your fortune to make your parent happy shall not have my emily shall he your emily your happy emily sir has not cannot have a heart that is worth notice if it be not implicitly guided by you this i said madam and it is true and did he not said i clasp his emily to his generous bosom when you said so no madam that would have been too great an honour but he called me good child and said you shall never be put to pay me an implicit regard your own reason and he called me child again shall always be the judge of my conduct to you and direct your observances of my advice something like this he said but in a better manner than i can say it he calls me oftener child madam than any thing else when we are alone together and is not quite so free i think at such times in his behaviour to me yet is vastly gracious i dont know how as when we are in company why is that i am sure i equally respect him at one time as at another do you think madam there is any thing in the observation is there any reason for it i do love to study him and to find out the meaning of his very looks as well as words sir charles grandisons heart is the book of heaven may i not study it study it my love while you have an opportunity but he will soon leave us he will soon leave england so i fear and i will love and pity the poor clementina whose heart is so much wounded and oppressed but my guardian shall be nobodys but yours i have prayed night and day the first thing and the last thing ever since i have heard of lady clementina that you and nobody but you may be lady grandison and i will continue my prayers but will you forgive me i always conclude them with praying that you will both consent to let the poor emily live with you sweet girl the poor emily said she i embraced her and we mingled tears both our hearts full each for the other and each perhaps for herself she hurried away i resumed my pen run off what had passed almost as swift as thought i quit it to prepare to attend my cousins to st jamesssquare letter xiv miss byron in continuation wednesday night april miss grandison as i told you took with her my letter of yesterday as soon as my cousin reeves and i entered sir charless house the two sisters conducted us into the drawingroom adjoining to the diningparlour and congratulated me on the high compliment their brother had made me though in preference to themselves and his communicativeness and tender behaviour to me lord l joined us and he having read the letter congratulated me also on what lucy why on the possibility that if the unhappy clementina should die or if she should be buried for life in a nunnery or if she should be otherwise disposed of why then that your harriet may have room given her to hope for a civil husband in sir charles grandison and half a heart is not this the sum of these humbling congratulations sir charles when we came was in his study with mr lowther the surgeon whom he had engaged to go abroad with him but he just came out to welcome us and then returned he had also with him two physicians eminent for their knowledge in disorders of the head to whom he had before communicated the case of the unhappy clementina and who brought to him in writing their opinions of the manner in which she ought to be treated according to the various symptoms of her disorder when he joined us he told us this and said very high things at the same time in praise of the english surgeons and particularly of this gentleman and added that as nervous disorders were more frequent in england than in any country in the world he was willing to hope that the english physicians were more skilful than those of any other country in the management of persons afflicted with such maladies and as he was now invited over he was determined to furnish himself with all the means he could think of that were likely to be useful in restoring and healing friends so dear to him miss grandison told him that we were all in some apprehensions on his going to ltaly of that fierce and wrongheaded man the general miss byron said she has told us that mrs beaumont advises not your going over the young marquis della porretta said he is hasty but he is a gallant man and loves his sister his grief on the unhappy situation they are in demands allowance it is natural in a heavy calamity to look out of ourselves for the occasion i have not any apprehensions from him or from any body else the call upon me is a proper one the issue must be left where it ought to be left if my visit will give comfort to any one of the family i shall be rewarded if to more than one happy and whatever be the event shall be easier in myself than i could be were i not to comply with the request of the bishop were he only to have made it lord l asked sir charles whether he had fixed the day of his setting out i have said he within this half hour mr lowther has told me that he shall be ready by the beginning of next week and on saturday sennight i hope to be at dover on my way we looked upon one another miss grandison told me afterwards that my colour went and came several times and that she was afraid for me my heart was indeed a little affected i believe i must not think of taking leave of him when he sets out ah lucy nine days hence yet in less than nine days after that i shall be embraced by the tenderest relations that ever creature had to boast of sir charles taking his sister aside i want said he to say a few words to you charlotte they were about half an hour together and then returning i am encouraged to think said he that charlotte will give her hand to lord g she is a woman of honour and her heart must therefore go with it i have a request to make to her before all you our common friends the earl of g lady gertrude lord g all join in one suit it is that i may be allowed to give my sister to lord g before i leave england i have told you brother that it is impossible if you go away in nine or ten days time sir charles particularly requested my influence i could have no doubt i said but miss grandison would oblige her brother she vehemently opposed so early a day in a most affectionate manner yet with an air of seriousness he urged his request he said that it was very proper for him to make some dispositions of his affairs before he went abroad he should leave england with much more pleasure if he saw his charlotte the wife of a man so worthy as lord g lord g said he adores you you intended to be his resolve to oblige your brother who though he cannot be happy himself wishes to see you so o sir charles said she you ruin me by your solemnity and by your goodness the subject is not a light one i am greatly in earnest charlotte i have many affairs on my hands my heart is in this company yet my engagements will permit me but few opportunities to enjoy it between this and tuesday next if you deny me now i must acquiesce if you have more than punctilio to plead say you have and i will not urge you farther and so this is the last time of asking sir a little archly not the last time of my lord gs but of mine but i will not allow you now to answer me lightly if you can name a day before tuesday you will greatly oblige me i will leave you to consider of it and he withdrew every one then urged her to oblige her brother lady l very particularly she told her that he was entitled to her compliance and that he had spoken to her on this subject in a still more earnest manner she should hardly be able to excuse her she said if the serious hint he had given about settling his affairs before he went abroad had not weight with her you know charlotte continued she that he can have no motive but your good and you have told me that you intend to have lord g and that you esteem his father his aunt and every one of his family whom you have seen and they are all highly pleased with you settlements are already drawn that my brother told you last night nothing is wanting but your day i wish he was in half the hurry to be married himself so he would be i dare say if marriage were as much in his power as it is in yours what a deuse to be married to a man in a weeks time with whom i have quarrelled every day for a fortnight past pride and petulance must go down by degrees sister a month at least is necessary to bring my features to such a placidness with him as to allow him to smile in my face your brother has hinted charlotte said i that he loves you for your vivacity and should still more if you consulted time and occasion he has withdrawn sister said lord l with a resolution if you deny him to urge you no further i hate his peremptoriness has he not told you charlotte said i and that in a manner so serious as to affect every body that there is a kind of necessity for it i dont love this clementina harriet all this is owing to her just then a rapping at the door signified visitors and emily ran in lord g the earl and lady gertrude believe me miss grandison changed colour a contrivance of my brothers ah lord now shall i be beset i will be sullen that i may not be saucy sullen you cant be charlotte said lady l but saucy you can remember however my brothers earnestness and spare lord g before his father and aunt or you will give me and every body pain how can i our last quarrel is not made up but advise him not to be either impertinent or secure immediately enterd sir charles introducing the earl and lady gertrude after the first compliments pray sir charles said miss grandison drawing him aside towards me and whispering tell me truly did you not know of this visit i invited them charlotte whispered he i meant not however to surprise you if you comply you will give me great pleasure if you do not i will not be displeased with my sister what can i do either be less good to me sir or less hurrying you have sacrificed enough to female punctilio charlotte lord g has been a zealous courtier you have no doubt of the ardor of his passion nor of your own power leave the day to me let it be tuesday next good heaven i cant bear you after such a and she gasped as if for breath and he turning from her to me she went to lady gertrude who rising took her hand and withdrew with her into the next room they staid out till they were told dinner was served and when they returned i thought i never saw miss grandison look so lovely a charming flush had overspread her cheeks a sweet consciousness in her eyes gave a female grace to her whole aspect and softened as i may say the natural majesty of her fine features lord g looked delighted as if his heart were filled with happy presages the earl seemed no less pleased miss grandison was unusually thoughtful all dinnertime she gave me great joy to see her so in the hope that when the lover becomes the husband the overlively mistress will be sunk in the obliging wife and yet now and then as the joy in my lords heart overflowed at his lips i could observe that archness rising to her eye that makes one both love and fear her after dinner the earl of g and lady gertrude desired a conference with sir charles and lady l they were not long absent when sir charles came in and carried out miss grandison to them lord gs complexion varied often sir charles left them together and joined us we were standing and he singled me out i hope madam said he that charlotte may be prevailed upon for tuesday next but i will not urge it further i thought that he was framing himself to say something particular to me when lady l came in and desired him and me to step to her sister who had retired from the earl and lady gertrude by consent ah my harriet said she pity me my dear debasement is the child of pride then turning to sir charles i acknowledge myself overcome said she by your earnestness as you are so soon to leave us and by the importunities of the earl of g lady gertrude and my sister unprepared in mind in clothes i am resolved to oblige the best of brothers do you sir dispose of me as you think fit my sister consents sir said lady l for next tuesday cheerfully i hope if charlotte balances whether if she took more time she should have lord g at all let her take it lord l in my absence will be to her all that i wish to be when she shall determine i balance not sir but i thought to have had a months time at least to look about me and having treated lord g too flippantly to give him by degrees some fairer prospects of happiness with me than hitherto he has had sir charles embraced her she was all his sister he said let the alteration now begin lord g would rejoice in it and consider all that had passed as trials only of his love for her the obliging wife would banish from his remembrance the petulant mistress and now allow me my dear sister to present you to the earl and lady gertrude he led her in to them lady l took my hand and led me in also charlotte my lord yields to yours and lady gertrudes importunities next tuesday will give the two families a near and tender relation to each other the earl saluted her in a very affectionate manner so did lady gertrude who afterwards ran out for her nephew and leading him in presented him to miss grandison she had just time to whisper me as he approached her ah harriet now comes the worst part of the show he kneeled on one knee kissed her hand but was too much overjoyed to speak for lady gertrude had told him as she led him in that tuesday was to be his happy day it is impossible lucy but sir charles grandison must carry every point he sets his heart upon when he shall appear before the family of porretta in italy who will be able to withstand him is not his consequence doubled more than doubled since he was with them the man whose absence they requested they now invite to come among them they have tried every experiment to restore their clementina he has a noble estate now in possession the fame of his goodness is gone out to distant countries o my dear all opposition must fly before him and if it be the will of heaven to restore clementina all her friends must concur in giving her to him upon the terms he has proposed and from which having himself proposed them sir charles grandison cannot recede his heart it is evident is at bologna well and so it ought to be and yet i could not forbear being sensibly touched by the following words which i overheard him say to lord l in answer to something my lord said to him i am impatient to be abroad had i not waited for mr lowther the last letters i received from italy should have been answered in person but as honour compassion love friendship still nobler than love have demands upon him let him obey the call he has set me high in his esteem let me be worthy of his friendship pangs i shall occasionally feel but who that values one person above the rest of the world does not sir charles as we sat at tea mentioned his cousin grandison to lord l it is strange my lord said he that we hear nothing of our cousin everard since he was seen at whites but whenever he emerges charlotte if i am absent receive him without reproaches yet i should be glad that he could have rejoiced with us must i leave england and not see him it has been it seems the way of this unhappy man to shut himself up with some woman in private lodgings for fear his cousin should find him out and in two or three months when he has been tired of his wicked companion emerge as sir charles called it to notice and then seek for his cousins favour and company and live for as many more months in a state of contrition and sir charles in his great charity believes that till some new temptation arises he is in earnest in his penitence and hopes that in time he will see his errors oh lucy what a poor creeping mean wretch is a libertine when one looks down upon him and up to such a glorious creature as sir charles grandison sir charles was led to talk of his engagement for tomorrow on the triple marriage in the danby family we all gave him joy of the happy success that had rewarded his beneficent spirit with regard to that family he gave us the characters of the three couples greatly to their advantage and praised the families on both sides which were to be so closely united on the morrow not forgetting to mention kindly honest mr sylvester the attorney he told us that he should set out on friday early for windsor in order to attend lord w in his first visit to mansfieldhouse you lady l will have the trouble given you said he of procuring to be newset the jewels of the late lady w for a present to the future bride my lord shewed them to me among a great number of other valuable trinkets of his late wifes in my last return from the hall they are rich and will do credit to his quality you my lord l you my sisters will be charmed with your new aunt and her whole family i have joy on the happiness in prospect that will gild the latter days of my mothers brother and at the same time be a means of freeing from oppression an ancient and worthy family tears were in every eye there now thought i sits this princely man rejoicing every one who sees him and hears him speak but where will he be nine days hence and whose this day twelvemonth he talked with particular pleasure of the expected arrival of his beauchamp he pleased himself that he should leave behind him a man who would delight every body and supply to his friends his absence what a character did he give and dr bartlett confirm of that amiable friend of his how did the earl and lady gertrude dwell upon all he said they prided themselves on the relation they were likely so soon to stand in to so valuable a man in your last letter you tell me lucy that mr greville has the confidence to throw out menaces against this excellent man sorry wretch how my heart rises against him he but no more of such an earthborn creature letter xv miss byron in continuation thursday morning april miss grandison accompanied by miss jervois has just left us lady l has undertaken she says to set all hands at work to have things in tolerable order early as the day is for tuesday next miss grandison would you believe it owns that she wants spirits to order anything what must be the solemnity of that circumstance when near that shall make charlotte grandison want spirits she withdrew with me to my apartment she threw herself into a chair tis a folly to deny it harriet but i am very low and very silly i dont like next tuesday by any means is your objection only to the day my dear i do not like the man is there any man whom you like better i cant say that neither but this brother of mine makes me think contemptibly of all other men i would compound for a man but half so good tender kind humane polite and even cheerful in affliction o harriet where is there such another man no where but you dont by marriage lose on the contrary you further engage and secure the affection of this brother you will have a goodnatured worthy man for your husband a man who loves you and you will have your brother besides do you think i can be happy with lord g i am sure you may if it be not your own fault thats the thing i may perhaps bear with the man but i cannot honour him then dont vow to honour him dont meet him at the altar yet i must but i believe i think too much and consideration is no friend to wedlock would to heaven that the same hour that my hand and lord gs were joined yours and my brothers were also united ah miss grandison if you love me try to wean me and not to encourage hopes of what never never can be dear creature you will be greater than clementina and that is greater than the greatest if you can conquer a passion that overturned her reason do not my charlotte make comparisons in which the conscience of your harriet tells her she must be a sufferer there is no occasion for me to despise myself in order to hold myself inferior to clementina well you are a noble creature but the approaching tuesday i cannot bear to think of it dear charlotte and dear harriet too but the officiousness the assiduities of this trifling man are disgustful to me you dont hate him hate him true i dont hate him but i have been so much accustomed to treat him like a fool that i cant help thinking him one he should not have been so tame to such a spirit as mine he should have been angry when i played upon him i have got a knack of it and shall never leave it off thats certain then i hope he will be angry with you i hope that he will resent your illtreatment of him too late too late to begin harriet i wont take it of him now he has never let me see that his face can become two sorts of features the poor man can look sorrowful that i know full well but i shall always laugh when he attempts to look angry you know better charlotte you may give him so much cause for anger that you may make it habitual to him and then would be glad to see him pleased men have an hundred ways that women have not to divert themselves abroad when they cannot be happy at home this i have heard observed by by your grandmother harriet good old lady in her reign it might be so but you will find that women now have as many ways to divert themselves abroad as the men have you not observed this yourself in one of your letters to lucy ah my dear we can every hour of the twentyfour be up with our monarchs if they are undutiful but charlotte grandison will not cannot why thats true my dear but i shall not then be a grandison yet the man will have some security from my brothers goodness he is not only good himself but he makes every one related to him either from fear or shame good likewise but i think that when one week or fortnight is happily over and my spirits are got up again from the depression into which this abominable hurry puts them i could fall upon some inventions that would make everyone laugh except the person who might take it into his head that he may be a sufferer by them and who can laugh and be angry in the same moment you should not marry charlotte till this wicked vein of humour and raillery is stopt i hope it will hold me till fifty dont say so charlotte say rather that you hope it will hold you so long only as it may be thought innocent or inoffensive by the man whom it will be your duty to oblige and so long as it will bring no discredit to yourself your servant goody gravity but what must be must the man is bound to see it it will be all his own seeking he will sin with his eyes open i think he has seen enough of me to take warning all that i am concerned about is for the next week or fortnight he will be king all that time yet perhaps not quite all neither and i shall be his sovereign ever after or i am mistaken what a deuse shall a woman marry a man of talents not superior to her own and forget to reward herself for her condescension but highho theres a sigh harriet were i at home i would either sing you a song or play you a tune in order to raise my own heart she besought me then with great earnestness to give her my company till the day arrived and on the day you see said she that my brother has engagements till monday dear creature support comfort me dont you see my heart beat through my stays if you love me come to me tomorrow to breakfast and leave me not for the whole time are you not my sister and the friend of my heart i will give you a month for it upon demand come let us go down i will ask the consent of both your cousins she did and they with their usual goodness to me cheerfully complied sir charles set out this morning to attend the triple marriages dressed charmingly his sister says i have made miss grandison promise to give me an account of such particulars as by the help of saunders and sir charless own relation she can pick up all we single girls i believe are pretty attentive to such subjects as these as what one day may be our own concern letter xvi miss grandison to miss byron thursday night unreasonable wicked cruel byron to expect a poor creature so near her execution to write an account of other peoples behaviour in the same tremendous circumstances the matrimonial noose has hung over my head for some time past and now it is actually fitted to my devoted neck almost choaked my dear this moment done hearing read the firsts seconds thirds fourths to near a dozen of them lord be merciful to us and the villanous lawyer rearing up to me his spectacled nose as if to see how i bore it lord g insulting me as i thought by his odious leers lady gertrude simpering little emily ready to bless herself how will the dear harriet bear these abominable recitatives but i am now up stairs from them all in order to recover my breath and obey my byron well but what am i now to say about the danbys richard has made his report sir charles has told us some things yet i will only give you heads make out the rest in the first place my brother went to mrs harringtons miss danbys aunt she did every thing but worship him she had with her two young ladies relations of her late husband dainty damsels of the city who had procured themselves to be invited that they might see the man whom they called a wonder of generosity and goodness richard heard one of them say to the other ah sister this is a king of a man what pity there are not many such but harriet if there were a hundred of them we would not let one of them go into the city for a wife would we my dear sir charles praised miss danby she was full of gratitude and of humility i suppose meek modest and humble are qualities of which men are mighty fond in women but matrimony and a sense of obligation are equally great humblers even of spirits prouder than that of miss danby as your poor charlotte can testify the young gentlemen with the rest were to meet sir charles the bride and these ladies at st helens i think the church is called as if wedlock were an honour the danby girl in respect to sir charles was to be first yoked he gave her away to the son galliard the father galliard gave his daughter to edward danby but first mr hervey gave his niece to the elder one of the brides i forget which fainted away another halffainted saved by timely salts the third poor soul wept heartily as i suppose i shall do on tuesday never surely was there such a matrimony promoter as my brother god give me soon my revenge upon him in the same way the procession afterwards was triumphant six coaches four silly souls in each and to mr poussins at enfield they all drove there they found another large company my brother was all cheerfulness and both men and women seemed to contend for his notice but they were much disappointed at finding he meant to leave them early in the evening one married lady the wife of sir somebody i am very bad at remembering the names of city knights was resolved she said since they could not have sir charles to open the ball to have one dance before dinner with the handsomest man in england the music was accordingly called in and he made no scruple to oblige the company on a day so happy do you know harriet that sir charles is supposed to be one of the finest dancers in england remember my dear that on tuesday lord help me i shall be then stupid and remember nothing you take him out yourself and then you will judge for yourself of his excellence in this science may we not call dancing a science if we judge by the few who perform gracefully in it i am sure we may and a difficult one too o and remember harriet that you get somebody to call upon him to sing you shall play i believe i shall forget in that only agreeable moment of the day for you have a sweet finger my love that i am the principal fool in the play of the evening o harriet how can i in the circumstances i am in write any more about these soft souls and silly come to me by daydawn and leave me not till i dont know when come and take my part my dear i shall hate this man he does nothing but hop skip and dance about me grin and make mouths and every body upholds him in it must this i hope not be the last time that i write myself to you charlotte grandison letter xvii miss byron to miss selby st jamesssquare friday morning april sir charles grandison set out early this morning for lord ws in his way to lady mansfields i am here with this whimsical charlotte lady l miss jervois myself and every female of the family or who do business for both sisters out of it are busy in some way or other preparatory to the approaching tuesday miss grandison is the only idle person i tell her she is affectedly so the earl has presented her in his sons name with some very rich trinkets very valuable jewels are also bespoke by lord g who takes lady ls advice in every thing as one well read in the fashions new equipages are bespoke and gay ones they will be miss grandison confounded me this morning by an instance of her generosity she was extremely urgent with me to accept as her third sister of her share of her mothers jewels you may believe that i absolutely refused such a present i was angry with her and told her she had but one way of making it up with me and that was that since she would be so completely set out from her lord she would unite the two halves by presenting hers to lady l who had refused jewels from her lord on her marriage and who then would make an appearance occasionally as brilliant as her own she was pleased with the hint and has actually given them unknown to any body but me to her jeweller who is to dispose them in such figures as shall answer those she herself is to have which lady l has not and by this contrivance which will make them in a manner useless to herself she thinks she shall oblige her sister however reluctant to accept of them lady gertrude is also preparing some fine presents for her niece elect but neither the delighted approbation of the family she is entering into nor the satisfaction expressed by her own friends give the perverse charlotte any visible joy nor procure for lord g the distinction which she ought to think of beginning to pay him but for his part never was man so happy he would however perhaps fare better from her if he could be more moderate in the outward expression of his joy which she has taken it into her head to call an insult upon her she does not however give the scope she did before the day was fixed to her playful captiousness she is not quite so arch as she was thoughtfulness and a seeming carelessness of what we are employed in appear in her countenance she saunters about and affects to be diverted by her harpsichord only what a whimsical thing is charlotte grandison but still she keeps lord g at distance i told her an hour ago that she knows not how to condescend to him with that grace which is so natural to her in her whole behaviour to every body else i have been talking to dr bartlett about sir charless journey to italy nobody knows he says what a bleeding heart is covered by a countenance so benign and cheerful sir charles grandison said he has a prudence beyond that of most young men but he has great sensibilities i take it for granted sir that he will for the future be more an italian than englishman impossible madam a prudent youth by travelling reaps this advantage from what he sees of other countries he learns to prefer his own an imprudent one the contrary sir charless country is endeared to him by his long absence from it italy in particular is called the garden of europe but it is rather to be valued for what it was and might be than what it is i need not tell a lady who has read and conversed as you have done to what that incomparable difference is owing sir charles grandison is greatly sensible of it he loves his country with the judgment of a wise man and wants not the partiality of a patriot but doctor he has offered you know to reside there i stopt true madam and he will not recede from his offers if they are claimed but this uncertainty it is that disturbs him i pity my patron proceeded he i have often told you he is not happy what has indiscretion to expect when discretion has so much to suffer his only consolation is that he has nothing to reproach himself with inevitable evils he bears as a man should he makes no ostentation of his piety but madam sir charles grandison is a christian you need not sir say more to me to exalt him and let me add that i have no small pleasure in knowing that clementina is a lady of strict piety though a roman catholic and let me assure you madam that sir charless regard for miss byron his more than regard for her why should i not say since every body sees it is founded upon her piety and upon the amiable qualities of her mind beauty madam is an accidental and transient good no man better knows how to distinguish between admiration and love than my patron his virtue is virtue upon full proof and against sensibilities that it is heroic to overcome lady olivia knows this and here i must acknowledge myself a debtor to you for three articles out of your ten i hope soon to discharge the obligation your own time doctor but i must say that whenever you give me lady olivias story i shall be pained if i find that a clementina is considered by a beauty of an unhappier turn as her rival in the love of sir charles grandison lady olivia madam admires him for his virtue but she cannot as he has made it his study to do divide admiration from love what offers has she not refused but she declares that she had rather be the friend of sir charles grandison than the wife of the greatest prince on earth this struck me have not i said something like it but surely with innocence of heart but here the doctor suggests that olivia has put his virtue to the proof yet i hope not the friend dr bartlett i hope that no woman who is not quite given up to dishonour will pollute the sacred word by affixing ideas to it that cannot be connected with it a friend is one of the highest characters that one human creature can shine in to another there may be love that though it has no view but to honour yet even in wedlock ripens not into friendship how poor are all such attachments how much beneath the exalted notion i have of that noblest that most delicate union of souls you wonder at me dr bartlett let me repeat to you sir i have it by heart sir charles grandisons tender of friendship to the poor harriet byron which has given me such exalted ideas of this disinterested passion but you must not take notice that i have i repeated those words beginning my heart demands alliance with hers and ending with these so long as it shall be consistent with her other attachments see page of this volume the doctor was silent for a few moments at last what a delicacy is there in the mind of this excellent man yet how consistent with the exactest truth the friendship he offers you madam is indeed friendship what you have repeated can want no explanation yet it is expressive of his uncertain situation it is he stopt of a sudden pray doctor proceed i love to hear you talk my good young lady i may say too much sir charles in these nice points must be left to himself it is impossible for any body to express his thoughts as he can express them but let me say that he justly as well as greatly admires miss byron my heart rose against myself bold harriet thought i how darest thou thus urge a good man to say more than he has a mind to say of the secrets of a friend which are committed to his keeping content thyself with the hopes that the worthiest man in the world would wish to call thee his were it not for an invincible obstacle and noble thrice noble clementina be thine the preference even in the heart of harriet byron because justice gives it to thee for harriet hast thou not been taught to prefer right and justice to every other consideration and wouldst thou abhor the thought of a common theft yet steal an heart that is the property and that by the dearest purchase of another letter xviii miss byron in continuation friday evening we have had a great debate about the place in which the nuptial ceremony is to be performed charlotte the perverse charlotte insisted upon not going to church lord g dared not to give his opinion though his father and lady gertrude as well as every other person were against her lord l said that if fine ladies thought so slightly of the office as that it might be performed anywhere it would be no wonder if fine gentlemen thought still more slightly of the obligation it laid them under being appealed to i said that i thought of marriage as one of the most solemn acts of a womans life and if of a womans of a mans surely interrupted lady l if your whimsey charlotte added she arises from modesty you reflect upon your sister and what is worse upon your mother charlotte put up her pretty lip and was unconvinced lady gertrude laid a heavy hand upon the affectation yet admires her nieceelect she distinguished between chambervows and churchvows she mentioned the word decency she spoke plainer on charlottes unfeeling perverseness if a bride meant a compliment by it to the bridegroom that was another thing but then let her declare as much and that she was in an hurry to oblige him charlotte attempted to kill her by a look she gave a worse to lord g and why whispered she to him as he sat next her must thou shew all thy teeth man as lady gertrude meant to shame her i thought i could as soon forgive that lady as her who was the occasion of the freedom of speech but still she was perverse she would not be married at all she said if she were not complied with i whispered her as i sat on the other side of her i wish charlotte the knot were tied till then you will not do even right things but in a wrong manner dr bartlett was not present he was making a kind visit to my cousins reeves when he came in the debate was referred to him he entered into it with her with so much modesty good sense propriety and steadiness that at last the perverse creature gave way but hardly would neither had he not assured her that her brother would be entirely against her and that he himself must be excused performing the sacred office but in a sacred place she has set her heart on the doctors marrying her the earl of g and lady gertrude as also lord and lady l went away not dissatisfied with charlottes compliance she is the most ungraciously graceful young woman i ever knew in her compliances but lord g was to pay for all she and i had got together in the study in bolted lord g perhaps with too little ceremony she coloured heyday sir who expected you his countenance immediately fell he withdrew precipitately fie charlotte said i recollect yourself and rising stept to the door my lord calling after him he came back but in a little ferment i hoped i hoped madam as you were not in your own apartment that i might that i might have been wherever ladies are by themselves it is a ladys apartment my lord said she with a haughtiness that sat better on her features than they would upon almost any other womans he looked as if he knew not whether he should stay or go sit down my lord said i we are not particularly engaged he came nearer his hat under his arm bowing to her who sat as stately as a princess on her throne but yet looked disobliged you give yourself pretty airs my lord dont you pretty airs madam pretty airs by my soul i think madam and with such a glow in your face madam taking his laced hat from under his arm and with an earnest motion swinging it backwards and forwards as unknowing what he did what sir am i to be buffetted sir he put his hat under his arm again buffetted madam would to heaven what has heaven to do with your odd ways lord g i beg pardon for intruding madam but i thought that you had a privilege sir but marriage itself sir shall not give you a privilege to break into my retirements you thought sir you could not think so much the worse if you did if i have really offended i will be more circumspect for the future i beg pardon madam miss byron i hope will forgive me too he was going in great discomposure and with an air of angry humility charlotte whispered i dont be silly come come now you have broke in upon us you may stay but another time when you know me to be retired with a friend so dear to me let it enter into your head that no third person unsent for can be welcome poor man how he loves her his countenance changed at once to the humble placid he looked as if he had rather be in fault than she oh how little did she make him look but he has often as well as in this instance let her see her power over him i am afraid she will use it i now see it is and will be his misfortune that she can vex him without being vexed herself and what may he expect who can be treated with feigned displeasure which while it seems to be in earnest to him will be a jest to his wife i was very angry with her when we were alone and told her that she would be an enemy i was afraid of her own happiness but she only laughed at me happiness my dear said she that only is happiness which we think so if i can be as happy in my way as you can be in yours shall i not pursue it your happiness child is in the still life i love not a dead calm now a tempest now a refreshing breeze i shall know how to enjoy the difference my brother will not be here to turn jest into earnest as might perhaps be the effect of his mediation but heighho harriet that the first week were over and i had got into my throne she ended with an italian air contrasted with another heighho and left me for a few moments poor lord g said i looking after her she returned soon poor lord g repeated she those were the piteous words you threw after me but if i should provoke him do you think he would not give me a cuff or so you know he cant return joke for joke and he must revenge himself some way if that should be the case poor charlotte i hope you would say not if you deserved it deserve a cuff harriet well but i am afraid i shall remember next tuesday charlotte you must vow obedience will you break your vow this is not a jesting matter true harriet and that it is not was perhaps one of the reasons that made me disinclined to go to so solemn a place as the church with lord g dont you think it one with those who insist upon being married in their own chamber i believe great people said i think they must not do right things in the common way that seems to me to be one of their fantastic reasons but the vow is the vow charlotte god is every where now you are so serious harriet it is time to have done with the subject i have no sleep in my eyes and must go on what keeps me more wakeful is my real concern for this naughty miss grandison and my pity for lord g for the instance i have given you of her petulance is nothing to what i have seen but i thought so near the day she would have changed her behaviour to him surely the situation her brother is in without any fault of his own might convince her that she need not go out of her path to pick up subjects for unhappiness such a kittenish disposition in her i called it for it is not so much the love of power that predominates in her mind as the love of playfulness and when the fit is upon her she regards not whether it is a china cup or a cork that she pats and tosses about but her sport will certainly be the death of lord gs happiness pity that sir charles who only has power over her is obliged to go abroad so soon but she has principles lady grandisons daughter sir charles grandisons sister must have principles the solemnity of the occasion the office the church the altar must strike her the vow will she not regard the vow she makes in circumstances so awful could but my lord g assume dignity and mingle raillery with it and be able to laugh with her and sometimes at her she would not make him her sport she would find somebody else a butt she must have to shoot at but i am afraid he will be too sensible of her smartness and she will have her jest let who will suffer by it some of the contents of your last are very agreeable to me lucy i will begin in earnest to think of leaving london dont let me look silly in your eyes my dear when i come it was not so very presumptuous in me was it to hope when all his relations when he himself yet what room for hope did he could he give me he was honest and i cheated myself but then all you my dearest friends encouraged the cheat nay pointed my wishes and my hopes by yours before i had dared shall i say or condescended to own them to myself you may let that greville know if you please that there is no room for his ifs nor of consequence any for his menaces you may own that i shall soon be in northamptonshire this may prevent his and fenwicks threatened journey to town but lucy though my heart has been ever dutifully as i may say open to the venerable domestic circle though it would not have been an honest heart could it circumstanced as i was have concealed itself from lady d and must have been an impenetrable one indeed if it could have been disguised to the two sisters here yet i beseech you my dear almost on my knees i beseech you let not the audacious the insulting greville have ground given him to suspect a weakness in your harriet which indelicate minds know not how to judge of delicately for sexsake for examplesake lucy let it not be known to any but the partial friendly few that our grandmamma shirleys child and aunt selbys niece has been a volunteer in her affections how many still more forward girls would plead mrs shirleys approbation of the hasty affection without considering the circumstances and the object so the next girl that run away to a dancingmaster or an ensign would reckon herself one of harriets school poor mr orme i am sorry he is not well it is cruel in you lucy at this time to say so undoubtingly that his illness is owing to his love of me you knew that such a suggestion would pain me heaven restore mr orme but i am vexed as it cannot be to purpose that sir charles grandison and i have been named together and talked of in your neighbourhood he will be gone abroad i shall return to northamptonshire and shall look so silly so like a refused girl every body gives me to him you say so much the worse i wonder what business this every body has to trouble itself about me one consolation however i shall have in my return and that is in my nancys recovered health which was so precarious when i set out for london but i shall have nothing to entertain you with when i am with you sir charles grandison lord and lady l lady g as now in three or four days she will be my dear miss jervois dr bartlett will be all my subject and have i not exhausted that by pen and ink o no the doctor promises to correspond with me and he makes no doubt but sir charles will correspond with him as usual what can the unusually tender friendship be called which he professed for me and as i may say claimed in return from me i know that he has no notion of the love called platonic nor have i i think it in general a dangerous allowance and with regard to our sex a very unequal one since while the man has nothing to fear the woman has every thing from the privileges that may be claimed in an acknowledged confidence especially in presence miss grandison thus interprets what he said and strengthens her opinion by some of dr bartletts late intimations that he really loves me but not being at liberty to avow his love he knew not what to say and so went as near to a declaration as was possible to do in his circumstances but might i not expect from such a profession of friendship in sir charles an offer of correspondence in absence and if he made the offer ought i to decline it would it not indicate too much on my side were i to do so and does it not on his if he make not the offer he corresponds with mrs beaumont nobody thinks that any thing can be meant by that correspondence on either side because mrs beaumont must be at least forty sir charles but six or seven and twenty but if he makes not the request to harriet who is but little more than twenty what after such professions of a friendship so tender will be inferred from his forbearance but i shall puzzle myself and you too lucy if i go on with this sort of reasoning because i shall not know how to put all i mean into words have i not already puzzled you i think my expression is weak and perplexed but this offered and accepted friendship between two persons not indelicate must be perplexing since he is the only young man in the world from whom a woman has no dishonour to fear ah lucy it would be vanity in me would it not to suppose that he had more to fear from harriet than she has from him as the virtue of either i hope is not questionable but the event of his italian visit will explain and reconcile every thing i will encourage a drowsy fit that seems to be stealing upon me if i have not written with the perspicuity i always aim at allow lucy for the time of night for spirits not high and for the subject that having its delicacies as well as uncertainties i am not able to write clearly upon it letter xix miss byron in continuation saturday night april sir charles is already returned he arrived at windsor on friday morning but found that lord w had set out the afternoon of the day before for the house of his friend sir joseph lawrence which is but fifteen miles from mansfieldhouse upon this intelligence sir charles wanting to return to town as soon as he could followed him to the knights and having time enough himself to reach mansfieldhouse that night he by his uncles consent pursued his journey thither to the great joy of the family who wished for his personal introduction of my lord to miss mansfield my lord arrived by breakfasttime unfatigued and in high spirits staid at mansfieldhouse all day and promised so to manage as to be in town tomorrow in order to be present at his nieces nuptials on tuesday as for sir charles he made the mansfield family happy in his company the whole friday evening inquiring into their affairs relating to the oppression they lay under pointing out measures for redress encouraging miss mansfield and informing the brothers that the lawyers he had consulted on their deeds told him that a new trial might be hoped for the result of which probably would be a means to do them justice so powerfully protected and assisted as they would now be for new lights had broke in upon them and they wanted but to recover a deed which they understood was in the hands of two gentlemen named hartley who were but lately returned from the indies thus prepared the mansfields also were in high spirits the next morning and looked sir charles said on each other when they met as if they wanted to tell each other their agreeable dreams sir charles in his way had looked in upon sir harry beauchamp and his lady he found sir harry in high spirits expecting the arrival of his son who was actually landed from calais having met there his fathers letter allowing him to return to england and wishing in his own and in lady beauchamps name his speedy arrival sir charless impatience to see his friend permitted him only to breakfast with my lord and the mansfields and to know the opinion each party formed of the other on this first interview and then he set out to sir harry beauchamps what an activity heaven reward him with the grant of his own wishes whatever they be and make him the happiest of men my lord is greatly taken with the lady and her whole family well he may sir charles says he blessed him and called himself blessed in his sisters son for his recommendation of each to the other the lady thinks better of him as her mother owned to sir charles than she thought she should from report i begin to think lucy that those who set out for happiness are most likely to find it when they live single till the age of fancy is over those who marry while it lasts are often disappointed of that which they propose so largely to themselves while those who wed for convenience and deal with tolerable honesty by each other are at a greater certainty tolerable i repeat since it seems we are to expect that both parties will turn the best side of the old garment outward hence arises consolation to old maidens and cautions against precipitation expatiate my dear on this fruitful subject i would were i at leisure sir charles says that he doubts not but lord w will be as happy a man as he wishes to be in less than a month the deuse is in this brother of mine whispered miss grandison to me for huddling up of marriages he dont consider that there may be two chances for one that his honest folks may in half a years time bless him the contrary way sir charles told us that he had desired lord w to give out every where that the adversaries of the mansfield family might know it his intended alliance and that he and his nephew were both determined to procure a retrospection of all former proceedings sir charles got to sir harry beauchamps a little before his friend arrived sir harry took him aside at his alighting and told him that lady beauchamp had had clouds on her brow all the day and he was afraid would not receive his son with the graciousness that once he hoped for from her but that he left him to manage with her she never said he had so high an opinion either of man or woman as she has of you sir charles addressed himself to her as not doubting her goodness upon the foot of their former conversation and praised her for the graces that however appeared but faintly in her countenance till his compliments lighted them up and made them shine full out in it he told her that his sister and lord g were to be married on the following tuesday he himself he said should set out for paris on friday after but hoped to see a family intimacy begun between his sisters and lady beauchamp and between their lords and sir harry and mr beauchamp he applauded her on the generosity of her intentions as declared to him in their former conference and congratulated her on the power she had of which she made so noble an use of laying at the same time an obligation on the tenderest of husbands and the most deserving of sons whose duty to her he engaged for all this set her in high good humour and she took to herself and bridled upon it to express myself in charlottes manner the praises and graces this adroit manager gave her as if they were her unquestionable due this agreeable way they were all in sir harry transported with his ladys goodness when mr beauchamp arrived the young gentleman bent his knee to his stepmother as well as to his father and thanked her for the high favours his father had signified to him by letter that he owed to her goodness she confirmed them but sir charles observed with an ostentation that shewed she thought very highly of her own generosity they had a very cheerful evening not one cloud would hang on lady beauchamps brow though once or twice it seemed a little overshadowed as mr beauchamp displayed qualities for which his father was too ready to admire him sir charles thought it necessary to caution sir harry on this subject putting it in this light that lady beauchamp loved her husband so well that she would be too likely to dread a rivalry in his affections from a son so very accomplished sir harry took the hint kindly mr beauchamp was under a good deal of concern at sir charless engagements to leave england so soon after his arrival and asked his fathers leave to attend him sir harry declared that he could not part with him sir charles chid his friend and said it was not quite so handsome a return as might have been expected from his beauchamp to the joyful reception he had met with from his father and lady beauchamp but she excused the young gentleman and said she wondered not that any body who was favoured with his friendship should be unwilling to be separated from him sir charles expresses great satisfaction in mr beauchamps being arrived before his departure that he may present to us himself a man with whom he is sure we shall all be delighted and leave him happy in the beloved society which he himself is obliged to quit a repining temper lucy would consider only the hardship of meeting a longabsent friend just to feel the uneasiness of a second parting but this man views every thing in a right light when his own happiness is not to be attained he lays it out of his thoughts and as i have heretofore observed rejoices in that of others it is a pleasure to see how sir charles seems to enjoy the love which dr bartlett expresses for this friend of them both sir charles addressed himself to me on several occasions in so polite in so tender a manner that every one told me afterwards they are sure he loves me dr bartlett at the time as he sat next me whispered on the regret expressed by all on losing him so soon ah madam i know and pity my patrons struggles struggles lucy what could the doctor mean by this whisper to me but i hope he guesses not at mine if he does would he have whispered his pity of sir charles to me come lucy this is some comfort however and i will endeavour to be brave upon it that i may not by my weakness lessen myself in the doctors good opinion it was agreed for charlotte whose assent was given in these words do as you will or rather as my brother will what signifies opposing him that the nuptials shall be solemnized as privately as possible at st georges church the company is to drop in at different doors and with as few attendants as may be lord w the earl of g and lady gertrude lord and lady l miss jervois and your harriet are to be present at the ceremony i was very earnest to be excused till miss grandison when we were alone dropt down on one knee and held up her hands to beg me to accompany her mr everard grandison if he can be found is to be also there at sir charless desire dr bartlett as i before hinted at her earnest request is to perform the ceremony sir charles wished it to be at his own parishchurch but miss grandison thought it too near to be private he was indifferent as to the place he said so it was at church for he had been told of the difficulty we had to get charlotte to desist from having it performed in her chamber and seemed surprised fie charlotte said he an office so solemn vows to receive and pay as in the divine presence she was glad she told me that she had not left that battle to be fought with him monday april lord w is come lord and lady l are here they and miss grandison received him with great respect he embraced his nieces in a very affectionate manner sir charles was absent lord w is in person and behaviour a much more agreeable man than i expected him to be nor is he so decrepit with the gout as i had supposed he is very careful of himself it seems this world has been kind to him and i fancy he makes a great deal of a little pain for want of stronger exercises to his patience and so is a sufferer by selfindulgence had i not been made acquainted with his free living and with the insults he bore from mrs giffard with a spirit so poor and so low i should have believed i saw not only the man of quality but the man of sense in his countenance i endeavoured however as much as i could to look upon him as the brother of the late lady grandison had he been worthy of that relation how should i have reverenced him but whatever i thought of him he was highly taken with me he particularly praised me for the modesty which he said was visible in my countenance freelivers lucy taken with that grace in a woman which they make it their pride to destroy but all men good and bad admire modesty in a woman and i am sometimes out of humour with our sex that they do not as generally like modesty in men i am sure that this grace in sir charles grandison is one of his principal glories with me it emboldens ones heart and permits one to behave before him with ease and as i may say with security in the consciousness of a right intention but what were lord ws praises of his nephew he called him the glory of his sex and of human nature how the cheeks of the dear emily glowed at the praises given to her guardian she was the taller for them when she moved it was on tiptoe stealing as it were across the floor lest she should lose any thing that was said on a subject so delightful to her my lord was greatly pleased with her too he complimented her as the beloved ward of the best of guardians he lamented with us the occasion that called his nephew abroad he was full of his own engagements with miss mansfield and declared that his nephew should guide and govern him as he pleased in every material case respecting either the conduct of his future life or the management and disposition of his estate declaring that he had made his will and reserving only his ladys jointure and a few legacies had left every thing to him how right a thing even in policy is it my dear to be good and generous i must not forget that my lord wished with all his soul that was his expression that he might have the honour of giving to his nephew my hand in marriage i could feel myself blush i halfsuppressed a sigh i would have wholly suppressed it if i could i recovered the little confusion his too plainly expressed wish gave me by repeating to myself the word clementina this charlotte is a great coward but i dare not tell her so for fear of a retort i believe i should be as great a one in her circumstances so few hours to one of the greatest events of ones life but i pretend not to bravery yet hope that in the cause of virtue or honour i should be found to have a soul i write now at my cousins i came hither to make an alteration in my dress i have promised to be with the sweet bully early in the morning of her important day letter xx miss byron in continuation tuesday night april wednesday morning miss grandison is no longer to be called by that name she is lady g may she make lord g as happy as i dare say he will make her if it be not her own fault i was early with her according to promise i found her more affected than she was even last night with her approaching change of condition her brother had been talking to her she said and had laid down the duties of the state she was about to enter into in such a serious manner and made the performance of them of so much importance to her happiness both here and hereafter that she was terrified at the thoughts of what she was about to undertake she had never considered matrimony in that formidable light before he had told her that he was afraid of her vivacity yet was loath to discourage her cheerfulness or to say any thing that should lower her spirits all he besought of her was to regard times tempers and occasions and then it would be impossible but her lively humour must give delight not only to the man whom she favoured with her hand but to every one who had the pleasure of approaching her if charlotte said he you would have the world around you respect your husband you must set the example while the wife gives the least room to suspect that she despises her husband she will find that she subjects him to double contempt if he resents it not and if he does can you be happy aggressors lay themselves open to severe reprisals if you differ you will be apt to make bystanders judges over you they will remember when you are willing to forget and your fame will be the sport of those beneath you as well in understanding as degree she believed she told me that lord g had been making some complaints of her if he had hush my dear said i not one word of threatening are you more solicitous to conceal your fault than to amend it no but you know harriet for a man before he has experienced what sort of a wife i shall make to complain against me for foibles in courtship when he can help himself if he will has something so very little your conscience charlotte tells you that he had reason for complaint and therefore you think he has complained think the best of lord g for your own reputations sake since you thought fit to go thus far with him you have borne nothing from him he has borne a great deal from you i am fretful harriet i wont be chidden i will be comforted by you you shall sooth me are you not my sister she threw her arms round me and kissed my cheek i ventured to rally her though i was afraid of her retort and met with it but i thought it would divert her i am glad my dear said i that you are capable of this tenderness of temper you blustering girls but fear i believe will make cowards loving harriet said she and flung from me to the window remember this may i soon see you in the same situation i will then have no mercy upon you the subject which sir charles led to at breakfast was the three weddings of thursday last he spoke honourably of marriage and made some just compliments to lord and lady l concluding them with wishes that his sister charlotte and lord g might be neither more nor less happy than they were then turning to lord w he said he questioned not his lordships happiness with the lady he had so lately seen for i cannot doubt said he of your lordships affectionate gratitude to her if she behaves as i am sure she will my lord had tears in his eyes never man had such a nephew as i have said he all the joy of my present prospects all the comforts of my future life are and will be owing to you here had he stopt it would have been well but turning to me he unexpectedly said would to god madam that you could reward him i cannot and nobody else can all were alarmed for me every eye was upon me a sickishness came over my heart i know not how to describe it my head sunk upon my bosom i could hardly sit yet was less able to rise sir charless face was overspread with blushes he bowed to my lord may the man said he who shall have the honour to call miss byron his be if possible as deserving as she is then will they live together the life of angels he gracefully looked down not at me and i got a little courage to look up yet lady l was concerned for me so was lord l emilys eye dropt a tear upon her blushing cheek was it not lucy a severe trial indeed it was my lord to mend the matter lamented very pathetically that sir charles was under an obligation to go abroad and still more that he could not stay to be present at the celebration of his nuptials with miss mansfield the earl lord g lady gertrude and the doctor were to meet the bride and us at church lord and lady l sir charles and emily went in one coach miss grandison and i in another as we went i dont like this affair at all harriet said she my brother has long made all other men indifferent to me such an infinite difference can any body be happier than lord and lady l charlotte yet lady l admires her brother as much as you can do they happy and so they are but lady l soft soul fell in love with lord l before my brother came over so the foundation was laid and it being a first flame with her she in compliment to herself could not but persevere but the sorry creature anderson proving a sorry creature made me despise the sex and my brothers perfections contributed to my contempt of all other men indeed my dear you are wrong lord g loves you but were sir charles not your brother it is not very certain that he would have returned your love why thats true i believe he would not in that case have chosen me i am sure he would not if he had known you but for the man one loves one can do any thing be every thing that he would wish one to be do you think you cannot love lord g for heavens sake charlotte though you are now almost within sight of the church do not think of giving your hand if you cannot resolve to make lord g as happy as i have no doubt he will make you if it be not your own fault what will my brother say what will leave that to me i will engage sir charles and dr bartlett to lend me their ear in the vestry and i am sure your brother if he knows that you have an antipathy to lord g or that you think you cannot be happy with him will undertake your cause and bring you off antipathy thats a strong word harriet the man is a goodnatured silly man silly charlotte silly then he must be for loving you so well who really have never yet given him an opportunity to shew his importance with you i do pity him sometimes the coach stopt ah lord harriet the church the church say charlotte before you step out shall i speak to your brother and dr bartlett in the vestry i shall look like a fool either way dont act like one charlotte on this solemn occasion say you will deserve that you will try to deserve lord gs love sir charles appeared lord help me my brother ill try ill try what can be done he gave each his hand in turn in we flew the people began to gather about us lord g all rapture received her at the entrance sir charles led me and the earl and lady gertrude received us with joy in their countenances i overheard the naughty one say as lord g led her up to the altar you dont know what you are about man i expect to have all my way remember thats one of my articles before marriage he returned her an answer of fond assent to her condition i am afraid thought i poor lord g you will be more than once reminded of this previous article when she was led to the altar and lord g and she stood together she trembled leave me not harriet said she brother lady l i am sure she looked sillier than lord g at that instant the good doctor began the office no dearly beloveds harriet whispered she as i had said on a really terrible occasion i was offended with her in my heart again she whispered something against the office as the doctor proceeded to give the reasons for the institution her levity did not forsake her even at that solemn moment when the service was over every one sir charles in a solemn and most affectionate manner wished her happy my lord g kissed her hand with a bent knee she took my hand ah lord what have i done and am i married whispered she and can it never be undone and is that the man to whom i am to be obedient is he to be my lord and master ah lady g said i it is a solemn office you have vowed he has vowed it is a solemn office lord g led her to the first coach sir charles led me into the same the people to my great confusion whispered thats the bride what a charming couple sir charles handed miss emily next lord g came in as he was entering harkee friend said charlotte and put out her hand you mistake the coach you are not of our company the whole world replied my lord shall not now divide us and took his seat on the same side with emily the mans a rogue harriet whispered she see he gives himself airs already this said lord g as the coach drove on taking one hand and eagerly kissing it is the hand that blessed me and that said she pushing him from her with the other is the hand that repulses your forwardness what came you in here for dont be silly he was in raptures all the way when we came home every one embraced and wished joy to the bride the earl and lady gertrude were in high spirits the lady resaluted her niece as her dear niece the earl recognised his beloved daughter but prepare to hear a noble action of lord w when he came up to compliment her my dearest niece said he i wish you joy with all my soul i have not been a kind uncle there is no fastening any thing on your brother accept of this and he put a little paper into her hand it was a banknote of my sisters daughter and your brothers sister merits more than this was not this handsomely presented lucy he then in a manner becoming lady grandisons brother stept to lady l my niece charlotte is not my only niece i wish you my dear as if this was your day of marriage all happiness accept these two papers the one lucy was a note for and the other for and he said the lesser note is due to you for interest on the greater when the ladies opened their notes and saw what they were they were at first at a loss what to say it was most gracefully done but see lucy the example of a good and generous man can sometimes alter natures and covetous men i have heard it observed when their hearts are opened often act nobly as soon as lady g so now i must call her recovered herself from the surprise into which my lords present and address had put her she went to him allow me my lord said she and bent one knee to him to crave your blessing and at the same time to thank you for your paternal present to your ever obliged charlotte god bless you my dear saluting her but thank your noble brother you delight me with your graceful acceptance lady l came up my lord you overcome me by your bounty how shall i your brothers princely spirit lady l said he makes this present look mean forgive me only that it was not done before and he saluted her lord l came up lady l shewed him the opened notes see here my lord said she what lord w has done and he calls this the interest due on that your lordship oppresses me with your goodness to your niece said lord l may health longlife and happiness attend you in your own nuptials there there said lord w pointing to sir charles who had withdrawn and then entered make your acknowledgment his noble spirit has awakened mine it was only asleep my late sisters brother wanted but the force of such an example that son is all his mother sir charles joining them having heard only the last words if i am thought a son not unworthy of the most excellent of mothers said he and by her brother i am happy then you are happy replied my lord her memory resumed sir charles i cherish and when i have been tempted to forget myself that memory has been a means of keeping me steady in my duty her precepts my lord were the guide of my early youth had i not kept them in mind how much more blamable than most young men had i been my charlotte have that mother in your memory on this great change of your condition you will not be called to her trials his eyes glistened tender be our remembrance of my father charlotte be worthy of your mother he withdrew with an air so noble but soon returning with a cheerful look he was told what lord w had done your lordship was before said he entitled to our duty by the ties of blood but what is the relation of body to that of mind you have bound me for my sisters and that still more by the manner than by the act in a bond of gratitude that never can be broken thank yourself thank yourself my noble nephew encourage my lord a family intimacy between your lady and her nieces and nephews you will be delighted my sisters with miss mansfield but when she obliges my lord with her hand you will reverence your aunt i shall have a pleasure when i am far distant in contemplating the family union your lordship must let me know your day in time and i will be joyful upon it whatever of a contrary nature i may have to struggle with on my own account my lord wept my lord wept did i say not one of us had a dry eye this was a solemn scene you will say for a wedding day but how delightfully do such scenes dilate the heart the day however was not forgotten as a day of festivity sir charles himself by his vivacity and openness of countenance made every one joyful and except that now and then a sigh which could not be checked stole from some of us to think that he would so soon be in another country far distant from the friends he now made happy and engaged in difficulties perhaps in dangers every heart was present to the occasion of the day o charlotte dear lady g hitherto it is in your power to make every future day worthy of this have your mother your noble mother in your memory my dear and give credit to the approbation of such a brother i should have told you that my cousins reeves came about two and were received with the utmost politeness by every body sir charles was called out just before dinner and returned introducing a young gentleman dressed as if for the day this is an earlier favour than i had hoped for said sir charles and leading him to lady g this sir is the queen of the day my dear lady g welcome the house is yours welcome the man i love welcome my beauchamp every one except emily and me crowded about mr beauchamp as sir charless avowedly beloved friend and bid him cordially welcome sir charles presenting him to each by name then leading him to me i am half ashamed lucy to repeat but take it as he spoke it revere said he my dear friend that excellent young lady but let not your admiration stop at her face and person she has a mind as exalted my beauchamp as your own miss byron in honour to my sister and of us all has gilded this day by her presence mr beauchamp approached me with polite respect the lady whom sir charles grandison admires as he does you must be the first of women i might have said that he who was so eminently distinguished as the friend of sir charles grandison must be a most valuable man but my spirits were not high i courtesied to his compliment and was silent sir charles presented emily to him my emily beauchamp i hope to live to see her happily married the man whose heart is but half so worthy as hers must be an excellent man modesty might look up and be sensible to compliments from the lips of such a man emily looked at me with pleasure as if she had said do you hear madam what a fine thing my guardian has said of me sir charles asked mr beauchamp how he stood with my lady beauchamp very well answered he after such an introduction as you had given me to her i must have been to blame had i not she is my fathers wife i must respect her were she ever so unkind to me she is not without good qualities were every family so happy as to have sir charles grandison for a mediator when misunderstandings happened there would be very few lasting differences among relations my father and mother tell me that they never sit down to table together but they bless you and to me they have talked of nobody else but lady beauchamp depends upon your promise of making her acquainted with the ladies of your family my sisters and their lords will do honour to my promise in my absence lady l lady g let me recommend to you lady beauchamp as more than a common visiting acquaintance do you sir to mr beauchamp see it cultivated mr beauchamp is an agreeable and when sir charles grandison is not in company a handsome and genteel man i think my dear that i do but the same justice that every body would do in this exception he is cheerful lively yet modest and not too full of words one sees both love and respect in every look he casts upon his friend and that he is delighted when he hears him speak be the subject what it will he once said to lord w who praised his nephew to him as he does to everybody near him the universal voice my lord is in his favour wherever he goes every one joins almost in the same words in different countries allowing for the different languages that for sweetness of manners and manly dignity he hardly ever had his equal sir charles was then engaged in talk with his emily she before him he standing in an easy genteel attitude leaning against the wainscot listening smiling to her prattle with looks of indulgent love as a father might do to a child he was fond of while she looked back every now and then towards me so proud poor dear of being singled out by her guardian she tript to me afterwards and leaning over my shoulder as i sat whispered i have been begging of my guardian to use his interest with you madam to take me down with you to northamptonshire and what is the result she paused has he denied your request no madam has he allowed you to go my dear if i comply turning half round to her with pleasure she paused and seemed at a loss i repeated my question why no he has not consented neither but he said such charming things so obliging so kind both of you and of me that i forgot my question though it was so near my heart but i will ask him again and thus lucy can he decline complying and yet send away a requester so much delighted with him as to forget what her request was miss grandison lady g i would say singled me out soon after this beauchamp is really a very pretty fellow harriet he is an agreeable man answered i so i think she said no more of him at that time between dinner and tea at lady ls motion they made me play on the harpsichord and after one lesson they besought sir charles to sing to my playing he would not he said deny any request that was made him on that day he sung he has a mellow manly voice and great command of it this introduced a little concert mr beauchamp took the violin lord l the bassviol lord g the german flute and most of the company joined in the chorus the song was from alexanders feast the words happy happy happy pair none but the good deserves the fair sir charles though himself equally brave and good preferring the latter word to the former lady l had always insisted upon dancing at her sisters wedding we were not company enough for country dances but music having been ordered and the performers come it was insisted upon that we should have a dance though we were engaged in a conversation that i thought infinitely more agreeable lord g began by dancing a minuet with his bride she danced charmingly but on my telling her so afterwards she whispered me that she should have performed better had she danced with her brother lord g danced extremely well lord l and lady gertrude mr beauchamp and mrs reeves mr reeves and lady l danced all of them very agreeably the earl took me out but we had hardly done when asking pardon for disgracing me as he too modestly expressed himself he and all but my cousins and emily called out for sir charles to dance with me i was abashed at the general voice calling upon us both but it was obeyed he deserved all the praises that miss gran lady g i would say gave him in her letter to me lord bless me my dear this man is every thing but his conversation has ever been among the politest people of different nations lord w wished himself able from his gout to take out miss jervois the bridegroom was called upon by sir charles and he took out the good girl who danced very prettily i fancied that he chose to call out lord g rather than mr beauchamp he is the most delicate and considerate of men sir charles was afterwards called upon by the bride herself and she danced then with a grace indeed i was pleased that she could perform so well at her own wedding supper was not ready till twelve mr reevess coach came about that hour but we got not away till two perhaps the company would not have broke up so soon had not the bride been perverse and refused to retire was she not at home she asked lady l who was put upon urging her and should she leave her company she would make me retire with her she took a very affectionate leave of me marriage lucy is an awful rite it is supposed to be a joyful solemnity but on the womans side it can be only so when she is given to the man she loves above all the men in the world and even to her the anniversary day when doubt is turned into certainty must be much happier than the day itself what a victim must that woman look upon herself to be who is compelled or even overpersuaded to give her hand to a man who has no share in her heart ought not a parent or guardian in such a circumstance especially if the child has a delicate an honest mind to be chargable with all the unhappy consequences that may follow from such a cruel compulsion but this is not the case with miss grandison early she cast her eye on an improper object her pride convinced her in time of the impropriety and this as she owns gave her an indifference to all men she hates not lord g there is no man whom she prefers to him and in this respect may perhaps be upon a par with eight women out of twelve who marry and yet make not bad wives as she played with her passion till she lost it she may be happy if she will and since she intended to be some time or other lady g her brother was kind in persuading her to shorten her days of coquetting and teasing and allow him to give her to lord g before he went abroad letter xxi miss byron in continuation wednesday april dr bartlett was so good as to breakfast with my cousins and me this morning he talks of setting out for grandisonhall on saturday or monday next we have settled a correspondence and he gives me hope that he will make me a visit in northamptonshire i know you will all rejoice to see him emily came in before the doctor went she brought me the compliments of the bride and lord w with their earnest request that i would dine with them sir charles was gone she said to make a farewell visit to the danby set but would be at home at dinner it would be better for me i think lucy to avoid all opportunities of seeing him dont you think so there is no such thing as seeing him with indifference but so earnestly invited how could i deny especially as my cousins were inclinable to go miss jervois whispered me at parting i never before said she had an opportunity to observe the behaviour of a newmarried couple to each other but is it customary madam for the bride to be more snappish as the bridegroom is more obliging lady g is very naughty my dear if she so behaves as to give you reason to ask this question she does and upon my word i see more obedience where it was not promised than where it was dear madam is not what is said at church to be thought of afterwards but why did not the doctor make her speak out what signified bowing except a woman was so bashful that she could not speak the bowing my dear is an assent it is as efficacious as words lord g only bowed you know could you like to be called upon emily to speak out why no but then i would be very civil and goodnatured to my husband if it were but for fear he should be cross to me but i should think it my duty as well sweet innocent she went away and left the doctor with me when our hearts are set upon a particular subject how impertinent how much beside the purpose do we think every other i wanted the doctor to talk of sir charles grandison but as he fell not into the subject and as i was afraid he would think me to be always leading him into it if i began it i suffered him to go away at his first motion i never knew him so shy upon it however sir charles returned to dinner he has told lady l who afterwards told us that he had a hint from mr galliard senior that if he were not engaged in his affections he was commissioned to make him a very great proposal in behalf of one of the young ladies he had seen the thursday before and that from her father surely lucy we may pronounce without doubt that we live in an age in which there is a great dearth of good men that so many offers fall to the lot of one but i am thinking tis no small advantage to sir charles that his time is so taken up that he cannot stay long enough in any company to suffer them to cast their eyes on other objects with distinction he left the numerous assembly at enfield while they were in the height of their admiration of him attention love admiration cannot be always kept at the stretch you will observe lucy that on the return of a longabsent dear friend the rapture lasts not more than an hour gladdened as the heart is the friend received and the friends receiving perhaps in less than that time can sit down quietly together to hear and to tell stories of what has happened to either in the long regretted absence it will be so with us lucy when i return to the arms of my kind friends and now does not sir charless proposed journey to italy endear his company to us the earl of g lady gertrude and two agreeable nieces of that noblemans were here at dinner lady g behaved pretty well to her lord before them but i who understood the language of her eyes saw them talk very saucily to him on several occasions my lord is a little officious in his obligingness which takes off from that graceful that polite frankness which so charmingly on all occasions distinguishes one happy man who was then present lord g will perhaps appear more to advantage in that persons absence mr beauchamp was also present he is indeed an agreeable a modest young man he appeared to great advantage as well in his conversation as by his behaviour and not the less for subscribing in both to the superiority of his friend who nevertheless endeavoured to draw him out as the first man after dinner lady l lady g and i found an opportunity to be by ourselves for one half hour lady g asked lady l what she intended to do with the thousand pounds with which lord w had so generously presented her do with it my dear what do you think i intend to do with it it is already disposed of ill be hanged said lady g if this good creature has not given it to her husband indeed charlotte i have i gave it to him before i slept i thought so she laughed and lord l took it did he to be sure he did i should otherwise have been displeased with him dear good soul and so you gave him a thousand pounds to take part of it back from him by four or five paltry guineas at a time at his pleasure lord l and i charlotte have but one purse you may not perhaps know how we manage it pray good meek dependent creature how do you manage it thus charlotte my lord knows that his wife and he have but one interest and from the first of our happy marriage he would make me take one key as he has another of the private drawer where his money and moneybills lie there is a little memorandumbook in the drawer in which he enters on one page the money he receives on the opposite the money he takes out and when i want money i have recourse to my key if i see but little in the drawer i am the more moderate or perhaps if my want is not urgent defer the supplying of it till my lord is richer but little or much i minute down the sum as he himself does and so we know what we are about and i never put it out of my lords power by my unseasonable expenses to preserve that custom of his for which he is as much respected as well served not to suffer a demand to be twice made upon him where he is a debtor good soul and pray dont you minute down too the use to which you put the money you take out indeed i often do always indeed when i take out more than five guineas at one time i found my lord did so and i followed the example of my own accord happy pair said i o lady g what a charming example is this i hope youll follow it thank you harriet for your advice why i cant but say that this is one pretty way of coaxing each other into frugality but dont you think that where an honest pair are so tender of disobliging and so studious of obliging each other that they seem to confess that the matrimonial good understanding hangs by very slender threads and do not the tenderest friendships said i hang by as slender can delicate minds be united to each other but by delicate observances why thou art a good soul too harriet and so you would both have me make a present to lord g of my thousand pounds before we have chosen our private drawer before he has got two keys made to it let him know charlotte what lord l and i do if you think the example worth following and then ay and then give him my thousand pounds for a beginning lady l but see you not that this proposal should come from him not from me and should we not let each other see a little of each others merits first see first the merits of the man you have married charlotte yes lady l but yesterday married you know can there be a greater difference between any two men in the world than there often is between the same man a lover and a husband and now my generous advisers be pleased to continue silent you cannot answer me fairly and besides wot ye not the indelicacy of an early present which you are not obliged to make we were both silent each expecting the other to answer the strange creature she laughed at us both soft souls and tender said she let me tell you that there is more indelicacy in delicacy than you very delicate people are aware of you charlotte said lady l have odder notions than any body else had you been a man you would have been a sad rake a rake perhaps i might have been but not a sad one lady l lady g cant help being witty said i it is sometimes her misfortune sometimes ours that she cannot however i highly approve of the example set by lord l and followed by lady l and so do i harriet and when lord g sets the example i shall consider of it i am not a bad economist had i ten thousand pounds in my hands i would not be extravagant had i but one hundred i would not be mean i value not money but as it enables me to lay an obligation instead of being under the necessity of receiving one i am my mothers daughter and brothers sister and yours lady l in this particular and yours too harriet different means may be taken to arrive at the same end lord g will have no reason to be dissatisfied with my prudence in moneymatters although i should not make him one of my best courtesies as if as if and she laughed but checking herself i were conscious again she laughed that i had signed and sealed to my absolute dependence on his bounty what a mad creature said lady l but my harriet dont you think that she behaved pretty well to lord g at table yes answered i as those would think who observe not her arch looks but she gave me pain for her several times and i believe her brother was not without his apprehensions he had his eyes upon you harriet replied lady g more earnestly than he had upon me or any body else thats true said lady l i looked upon both him and you my dear with pity my tears were ready to start more than once to reflect how happy you two might be in each other and how greatly you would love each other were it not not one word more on this subject dear lady l i cannot bear it i thought myself that he often cast an eye of tenderness upon me i cannot bear it i am afraid of myself of my justice his tender looks did not escape me said lady g nor yet did my dear harriets but we will not touch this string it is too tender a one i for my part was forced in order to divert myself to turn my eyes on lord g he got nothing by that the most officious nay lady g interrupted i you shall not change the discourse at the expense of the man you have vowed to honour i will be pained myself by the continuation of the former subject rather than that shall be charming harriet said lady l i hope your generosity will be rewarded yet tell me my dear can you wish lady clementina may be his i have no doubt but you wish her recovery but can you wish her to be his i have debated the matter my dear lady l with myself i am sorry it has admitted of debate so excellent a creature such an honour to her sex so nobly sincere so pious but i will confess the truth i have called upon justice to support me in my determination i have supposed myself in her situation her unhappy malady excepted i have supposed her in mine and ought i then to have hesitated to which to give the preference yet what yet most frank and most generous of women said lady l clasping her arms about me what yet why yetah ladies why yet i have many a pang many a twitch as i may call it why is your brother so tenderhearted so modest so faultless why did he not insult me with his pity why does he on every occasion shew a tenderness for me that is more affecting than pity and why does he give me a consequence that exalts while it depresses me i turned my head aside to hide my emotion lady g snatched my handkerchief from me and wiped away a starting tear and called me by very tender names am i dear continued i to the heart of such a man you think i am allow me to say that he is indeed dear to mine yet i have not a wish but for his happiness whatever becomes of me emily appeared at the door may i come in ladies i will come in my dear miss byron affected my dear miss byron in tears her pity without knowing the cause sprung to her eyes she took my hand in both hers and repeatedly kissed it my guardian asks for you o with what tenderness of voice where is your miss byron love he calls every one by gentle names when he speaks of you his voice then is the voice of love love said he to me through you madam he will love his ward and on your love will i build all my merit but you sigh dear miss byron you sigh forgive your prating girl you must not be grieved i embraced her grief my dear reaches not my heart at this time it is the merit of your guardian that affects me god bless you madam for your gratitude to my guardian a clementina and a harriet said lady l two women so excellent what a fate is his how must his heart be divided divided say you lady l resumed lady g the man who loves virtue for virtues sake loves it wherever he finds it such a man may distinguish more virtuous women than one and if he be of a gentle and beneficent nature there will be tenderness in his distinction to every one varying only according to the difference of circumstance and situation let me embrace you my charlotte resumed lady l for that thought dont let me hear for a month to come one word from the same lips that may be unworthy of it you have lord g in your head lady l but never mind us he must now and then be made to look about him ill take care to keep up my consequence with him never fear nor shall he have reason to doubt the virtue of his wife virtue my dear said i what is virtue only she who will not be virtuous for virtues sake is not worthy to be called a woman but she must be something more than virtuous for her husbands nay for her vows sake complacency obligingness obedience too i warrant hush hush my sweet harriet putting her hand before my mouth we will behave as well as we can and that will be very well if nobody minds us and now let us go down together letter xxii miss byron in continuation thursday april we played at cards last night till suppertime when that was over every one sought to engage sir charles in discourse i will give you some particulars of our conversation as i did of one before lord w began it with a complaint of the insolence and profligateness of servants what he said was only answered by sir charles with the word example example my good lord repeated you sir charles replied my lord may indeed insist upon the force of example for i cannot but observe that all those of yours whom i have seen are entitled to regard they have the looks of men at ease and of men grateful for that ease they know their duty and need not a reminding look a servant of yours sir charles looks as if he would one day make a figure as a master how do you manage it perhaps i have been peculiarly fortunate in worthy servants there is nothing in my management deserving the attention of this company i am going to begin the world anew nephew hitherto servants have been a continual plague to me i must know how you treat them i treat them my lord as necessary parts of my family i have no secrets the keeping or disclosing of which might give them selfimportance i endeavour to set them no bad example i am never angry with them but for wilful faults if those are not habitual i shame them into amendment by gentle expostulation and forgiveness if they are not capable of a generous shame and the faults grow habitual i part with them but with such kindness as makes their fellowservants blame them and take warning i am fond of seeking occasions to praise them and even when they mistake if it be with a good intention they have my approbation of the intention and my endeavours to set them right as to the act sobriety is an indispensable qualification for my service and for the rest if we receive them not quite good we make them better than they were before generally speaking a master may make a servant what he pleases servants judge by example rather than precept and almost always by their feelings one thing more permit me to add i always insist upon my servants being kind and compassionate to one another a compassionate heart cannot habitually be an unjust one and thus do i make their goodnature contribute to my security as well as quiet my lord was greatly pleased with what his nephew said upon some occasion lady g reflected upon a lady for prudery and was going on when sir charles interrupting her said take care lady g you ladies take care for i am afraid that modesty under this name will become ignominious and be banished the hearts at least the behaviour and conversation of all those whose fortunes or inclinations carry them often to places of public resort talk of places of public resort said lord l it is vexatious to observe at such how men of real merit are neglected by the fine ladies of the age while every distinction is shewn to fops and foplings but who my lord said sir charles are those women are they not generally of a class with those men flippant women love empty men because they cannot reproach them with a superiority of understanding but keep their folly in countenance they are afraid of a wise man but i would by no means have such a one turn fool to please them for they will despise the wise mans folly more than the silly mans and with reason because being uncharacteristic it must sit more awkwardly upon him than the others can do yet wisdom itself and the truest wisdom goodness said mrs reeves is sometimes thought to sit ungracefully when it is uncharacteristic not to the man but to the times she then named a person who was branded as a hypocrite for performing all his duties publicly he will be worse spoken of if he declines doing so said dr bartlett his enemies will add the charge of cowardice and not acquit him of the other lady gertrude being withdrawn it was mentioned as a wonder that so agreeable a woman as she must have been in her youth and still was for her years should remain single lord g said that she had had many offers and once before she was twenty had like to have stolen a wedding but her fears he said since that had kept her single the longer said sir charles a woman remains unmarried the more apprehensive she will be of entering into the state at seventeen or eighteen a girl will plunge into it sometimes without either fear or wit at twenty she will begin to think at twentyfour will weigh and discriminate at twentyeight will be afraid of venturing at thirty will turn about and look down the hill she has ascended and as occasions offer and instances are given will sometimes repent sometimes rejoice that she has gained that summit sola indeed said mrs reeves i believe in england many a poor girl goes up the hill with a companion she would little care for if the state of a single woman were not here so peculiarly unprovided and helpless for girls of slender fortunes if they have been genteelly brought up how can they when family connexions are dissolved support themselves a man can rise in a profession and if he acquires wealth in a trade can get above it and be respected a woman is looked upon as demeaning herself if she gains a maintenance by her needle or by domestic attendance on a superior and without them where has she a retreat you speak good mrs reeves said sir charles as if you would join with dr bartlett and me in wishing the establishment of a scheme we have often talked over though the name of it would make many a lady start we want to see established in every county protestant nunneries in which single women of small or no fortunes might live with all manner of freedom under such regulations as it would be a disgrace for a modest or good woman not to comply with were she absolutely on her own hands and to be allowed to quit it whenever they pleased well brother said lady g and why could you not have got all this settled a fortnight ago you that can carry every point and have made poor me a lady abbess you are still better provided for my sister but let the doctor and me proceed with our scheme the governesses or matrons of the society i would have to be women of family of unblamable characters from infancy and noted equally for their prudence goodnature and gentleness of manners the attendants for the slighter services should be the hopeful female children of the honest industrious poor do you not ladies imagine said dr bartlett that such a society as this all women of unblemished reputation employing themselves as each consulting her own genius at her admission shall undertake to employ herself and supported genteelly some at more some at less expense to the foundation according to their circumstances might become a national good and particularly a seminary for good wives and the institution a stand for virtue in an age given up to luxury extravagance and amusements little less than riotous how could it be supported said lord w many of the persons of which each community would consist would be i imagine replied sir charles no expense to it at all as numbers of young women joining their small fortunes might be able in such a society to maintain themselves genteelly on their own income though each singly in the world would be distressed besides liberty might be given for wives in the absence of their husbands in this maritime country and for widows who on the deaths of theirs might wish to retire from the noise and hurry of the world for three six or twelve months more or less to reside in this wellregulated society and such persons we may suppose would be glad according to their respective abilities to be benefactresses to it no doubt but it would have besides the countenance of the welldisposed of both sexes since every family in britain in their connexions and relations near or distant might be benefited by so reputable and useful an institution to say nothing of the works of the ladies in it the profits of which perhaps will be thought proper to be carried towards the support of a foundation that so genteelly supports them yet i would have a number of hours in each day for the encouragement of industry that should be called their own and what was produced in them to be solely appropriated to their own use a truly worthy divine at the appointment of the bishop of the diocese to direct and animate the devotion of such a society and to guard it from that superstition and enthusiasm which soars to wild heights in almost all nunneries would confirm it a blessing to the kingdom i have another scheme my lord proceeded sir charles an hospital for female penitents for such unhappy women as having been once drawn in and betrayed by the perfidy of men find themselves by the cruelty of the world and principally by that of their own sex unable to recover the path of virtue when perhaps convinced of the wickedness of the men in whose honour they confided they would willingly make their first departure from it the last these continued he are the poor creatures who are eminently entitled to our pity though they seldom meet with it good nature and credulity the child of good nature are generally as i have the charity to believe rather than viciousness the foundation of their crime those men who pretend they would not be the first destroyers of a womans innocence look upon these as fair prize but what a wretch is he who seeing a poor creature exposed on the summit of a dangerous precipice and unable without an assisting hand to find her way down would rather push her into the gulf below than convey her down in safety speaking of the force put upon a daughters inclinations in wedlock tyranny and ingratitude said sir charles from a man beloved will be more supportable to a woman of strong passions than even kindness from a man she loves not shall not parents then who hope to see their children happy avoid compelling them to give their hands to a man who has no share in their hearts but would you allow young ladies to be their own choosers sir charles said mr reeves daughters replied he who are earnest to choose for themselves should be doubly careful that prudence justifies their choice every widow who marries imprudently and very many there are who do furnishes a strong argument in favour of a parents authority over a maiden daughter a designing man looks out for a woman who has an independent fortune and has no questions to ask he seems assured of finding indiscretion and rashness in such a one to befriend him but ought not she to think herself affronted and resolve to disappoint him but how said lady g shall a young creature be able to judge by his application to her rather than to her natural friends and relations by his endeavouring to alienate her affections from them by wishing her to favour private and clandestine meetings conscious that his pretensions will not stand discussion by the inequality of his fortune to hers and has not our excellent miss byron in the letters to her lucy bowing to me which she has had the goodness to allow us to read helped us to a criterion men in their addresses to young women she very happily observes forget not to set forward the advantages by which they are distinguished whether hereditary or acquired while love love is all the cry of him who has no other to boast of and by that means said lady gertrude setting the silly creature at variance with all her friends he makes her fight his battles for him and become herself the cats paw to help him to the ready roasted chesnuts but dear brother said lady g do you think love is such a staid deliberate passion as to allow a young creature to take time to ponder and weigh all the merits of the cause love at first sight answered sir charles must indicate a mind prepared for impression and a sudden gust of passion and that of the least noble kind since there could be no opportunity of knowing the merit of the object what woman would have herself supposed capable of such a tindery fit in a man it is an indelicate paroxysm but in a woman who expects protection and instruction from a man much more so love at first may be only fancy such a young love may be easily given up and ought to a parents judgment nor is the conquest so difficult as some young creatures think it one thing my good emily let me say to you as a rule of some consequence in the world you are just entering into young persons on arduous occasions especially in lovecases should not presume to advise young persons because they seldom can divest themselves of passion partiality or prejudice that is indeed of youth and forbear to mix their own concerns and biases with the question referred to them it should not be put from young friend to young friend what would you do in such a case but what ought to be done how the dear girl blushed and how pleased she looked to be particularly addressed by her guardian lady gertrude spoke of a certain father who for interested views obliged his daughter to marry at fifteen when she was not only indifferent to the man but had formed no right notions of the state and are they not unhappy asked sir charles they are replied she i knew such an instance returned he the lady was handsome and had her full share of vanity she believed every man who said civil things to her was in love with her and had she been single that he would have made his addresses to her she supposed that she might have had this great man or that had she not been precipitated and this brought her to slight the man who had as she concluded deprived her of better offers they were unhappy to the end of their lives had the lady lived single long enough to find out the difference between compliment and sincerity and that the man who flattered her vanity meant no more than to take advantage of her folly she would have thought herself not unhappy with the very man with whom she was so dissatisfied lady l speaking afterwards of a certain nobleman who is continually railing against matrimony and who makes a very indifferent husband to an obliging wife i have known more men than one said sir charles inveigh against matrimony when the invective would have proceeded with a much better grace from their wives lips than from theirs but let us inquire would this complainer have been or deserved to be happier in any state than he now is a state of suffering said lady l had probably humbled the spirit of the poor wife into perfect meekness and patience you observe rightly replied sir charles and surely a most kind disposition of providence it is that adversity so painful in itself should conduce so peculiarly to the improvement of the human mind it teaches modesty humility and compassion you speak feelingly brother said lady l with a sigh do you think lucy nobody sighed but she i do said he i speak with a sense of gratitude i am naturally of an imperious spirit but i have reaped advantages from the early stroke of a mothers death being for years against my wishes obliged to submit to a kind of exile from my native country which i considered as a heavy evil though i thought it my duty to acquiesce i was determined as much as my capacity would allow to make my advantage of the compulsion by qualifying myself to do credit rather than discredit to my father my friends and my country and let me add that if i have in any tolerable manner succeeded i owe much to the example and precepts of my dear dr bartlett the doctor blushed and bowed and was going to disclaim the merit which his patron had ascribed to him but sir charles confirmed it in still stronger terms you my dear dr bartlett said he as i have told miss byron was a second conscience to me in my earlier youth your precepts your excellent life your pure manners your sweetness of temper could not but open and enlarge my mind the soil i hope i may say was not barren but you my dear paternal friend was the cultivator i shall ever acknowledge it and he bowed to the good man who was covered with modest confusion and could not look up and think you lucy that this acknowledgment lessened the excellent man with any one present no it raised him in every eye and i was the more pleased with it as it helped me to account for that deep observation which otherwise one should have been at a loss to account for in so young a man and yet i am convinced that there is hardly a greater difference in intellect between angel and man than there is between man and man letter xxiii lady g to miss byron thursday april for heavens sake my dearest harriet dine with us today for two reasons one relates to myself the other you shall hear by and by to myself first as is most fit this silly creature has offended me and presumed to be sullen upon my resentment married but two days and shew his airs were i in fault my dear which upon my honour i am not for the man to lose his patience with me to forget his obligations to me in two days what an ungrateful wretch is he what a poor powerless creature your charlotte nobody knows of the matter except he has complained to my brother if he has but what if he has alas my dear i am married and cannot help myself we seem however to be drawing up our forces on both sides one struggle for my dying liberty my dear the success of one pitched battle will determine which is to be the general which the subaltern for the rest of the campaign to dare to be sullen already as i hope to live my dear i was in high good humour within myself and when he was foolish only intended a little play with him and he takes it in earnest he worships you so i shall rally him before you but i charge you as the man by his sullenness has taken upon him to fight his own battle either to be on my side or be silent i shall take it very ill of my harriet if she strengthen his hands well but enough of this husband husband what a word who do you think is arrived from abroad you cannot guess for your life lady olivia true as you are alive accompanied it seems by an aunt of hers a widow whose years and character are to keep the niece in countenance in this excursion the pretence is making the tour of europe and england was not to be left out of the scheme my brother is excessively disturbed at her arrival she came to town but last night he had notice of it but this morning he took emily with him to visit her emily was known to her at florence she and her aunt are to be here at dinner as she is come sir charles says he must bring her acquainted with his sisters and their lords in order to be at liberty to pursue the measures he has unalterably resolved upon and this harriet is my second reason for urging you to dine with us now i do wish we had known her history at large dr bartlett shall tell it us unwelcome as she is to my brother i long to see her i hope i shall not hear something in her story that will make me pity her will you come i wonder whether she speaks english or not i dont think i can converse in italian i wont forgive you if you refuse to come lady l and her good man will be here we shall therefore if you come be our whole family together my brother has presented this house to me till his return he calls himself lord gs guest and mine so you can have no punctilio about it besides lord w will set out tomorrow morning for windsor he dotes upon you and perhaps it is in your power to make a newmarried man penitent and polite so you must come hang me if i sign by any other name while this man is in fits than that of charlotte grandison letter xxiv miss byron to miss selby thursday april i send you enclosed a letter i received this morning from lady g i will suppose you have read it emily says that the meeting between sir charles and the lady mentioned in it was very polite on both sides but more cold on his than on hers she made some difficulty however of dining at his house and her aunt lady maffei more but on sir charless telling them that he would bring his elder sister to attend them thither they complied when i went to st jamesssquare sir charles and lady l were gone in his coach to bring the two ladies lady g met me on the stairshead leading into her dressingroom not a word said she of the mans sullens he repents a fine figure as i told him of a bridegroom would he make in the eyes of foreign ladies at dinner were he to retain his gloomy airs he has begged my pardon as good as promised amendment and i have forgiven him poor lord g said i hush hush he is within he will hear you and then perhaps repent of his repentance she led me in my lord had a glow in his cheeks and looked as if he had been nettled and was but just recovering a smile to help to carry off the petulance o how saucily did her eyes look well my lord said she i hope but you say i misunderstood no more madam no more i beseech you well sir not a word more since you are pray madam well well give me your hand you must leave harriet and me together she humorously courtesied to him as he bowed to me taking the compliment as to herself she nodded her head to him as he turned back his when he was at the door and when he was gone if i can but make this man orderly said she i shall not quarrel with my brother for hurrying me as he has done you are wrong excessively wrong charlotte you call my lord a silly man but can have no proof that he is so but by his bearing this treatment from you none of your grave airs my dear the man is a good sort of man and will be so if you and lady l dont spoil him i have a vast deal of roguery but no illnature in my heart there is luxury in jesting with a solemn man who wants to assume airs of privilege and thinks he has a right to be impertinent ill tell you how i will manage i believe i shall often try his patience and when i am conscious that i have gone too far i will be patient if he is angry with me so we shall be quits then ill begin again he will resent and if i find his aspect very solemn come come no glouting friend i will say and perhaps smile in his face ill play you a tune or sing you a song which which speak in a moment or the humour will be off if he was ready to cry before he will laugh then though against his will and as he admires my finger and my voice shall we not be instantly friends it signified nothing to rave at her she will have her way poor lord g at my first knowledge of her i thought her very lively but imagined not that she was indiscreetly so lord gs fondness for his saucy bride was as i have reason to believe his fault i dared not to ask for particulars of their quarrel and if i had and found it so could not with such a rallying creature have entered into his defence or censured her i went down a few moments before her lord g whispered me that he should be the happiest man in the world if i who had such an influence over her would stand his friend i hope my lord said i that you will not want any influence but your own she has a thousand good qualities she has charming spirits you will have nothing to bear with but from them they will not last always think only that she can mean nothing by the exertion of them but innocent gaiety and she will every day love your lordship the better for bearing with her you know she is generous and noble i see madam said he she has let you into she has not acquainted me with the particulars of the little misunderstanding only has said that there had been a slight one which was quite made up i am ashamed replied he to have it thought by miss byron that there could have been a misunderstanding between us especially so early she knows her power over me i am afraid she despises me impossible my lord have you not observed that she spares nobody when she is in a lively humour true but here she comes not a word madam i bowed assenting silence lord g said she approaching him in a low voice i shall be jealous of your conversations with miss byron would to heaven my dearest life snatching at her withdrawn hand that i were half as good as miss byron i understand you but time and patience sir nodding to him and passing him admirable creature said he how i adore her i hinted to her afterwards his fear of her despising him harriet answered she with a serious air i will do my duty by him i will abhor my own heart if i ever find in it the shadow of a regard for any man in the world inconsistent with that which he has a right to expect from me i was pleased with her and found an opportunity to communicate what she said in confidence to my lord and had his blessings for it but now for some account of lady olivia with which i will begin a new letter letter xxv miss byron in continuation sir charles returned with the ladies he presented to lady olivia and her aunt lady g lord l and lord w i was in another apartment talking with dr bartlett lady olivia asked for the doctor he left me to pay his respects to her sir charles being informed that i was in the house told lady olivia that he hoped he should have the honour of presenting to her one of our english beauties desiring lady g to request my company lady g came to me a lovely woman i assure you harriet let me lead you to her sir charles met me at the entrance of the drawingroom excuse me madam said he taking my hand with profound respect and allow me to introduce to a very amiable italian lady one who does so much honour to britain miss byron madam addressing himself to her salutes you the advantages of person are her least perfection her face glowed miss byron said she in french is all loveliness a relation sir in italian he bowed but answered not her question i would sooner forgive you here whispered lady olivia to sir charles in italian looking at me than at bologna i heard her and by my confusion shewed that i understood her she was in confusion too mademoiselle said she in french understands italian i am ashamed monsieur miss byron does answered sir charles and french too i must have the honour said she in french to be better known to you mademoiselle i answered her as politely as i could in the same language lady olivia is really a lovely woman her complexion is fine her face oval every feature of it is delicate her hair is black and i think i never saw brighter black eyes in my life if possible they are brighter and shine with a more piercing lustre than even sir charles grandisons but yet i give his the preference for we see in them a benignity that hers though a womans has not and a thoughtfulness as if something lay upon his mind which nothing but patience could overcome yet mingled with an air that shews him to be equal to any thing that can be undertaken by man while olivias eyes shew more fire and impetuosity than sweetness had i not been told it i should have been sure that she has a violent spirit but on the whole she is a very fine figure of a woman she talked of taking a house and staying in england a year at least and was determined she said to perfect herself in the language and to become an englishwoman but when sir charles in the way of discourse mentioned his obligation to leave england as on next friday morning how did she and her aunt look upon each other and how was the sunshine that gilded her fine countenance shut in surely sir said her aunt you are not in earnest after dinner the two ladies retired with sir charles at his motion dr bartlett at lady gs request then gave us this short sketch of her history he said she had a vast fortune she had had indiscretions but none that had affected her character as to virtue but her spirit could not bear control she had shewn herself to be vindictive even to a criminal degree lord bless me my dear the doctor has mentioned to me in confidence that she always carries a poniard about her and that once she used it had the person died she would have been called to public account for it the man it seems was of rank and offered some slight affront to her she now comes over the doctor said as he had reason to believe with a resolution to sacrifice even her religion if it were insisted upon to the passion she had so long in vain endeavoured to conquer she has he says an utter hatred to lady clementina and will not be able to govern her passion he is sure when sir charles shall acquaint her that he is going to attend that lady and her family for he has only mentioned his obligation to go abroad but not said whither lord w praised the person of the lady and her majestic air lord l and lord g wished to be within hearing of the conference between her and sir charles so did lady g and while they were thus wishing in came sir charles his face all in a glow lady l said he be so good as to attend lady olivia she went to her sir charles staid not with us yet went not to the lady but into his study dr bartlett attended him there the doctor returned soon after to us his noble heart is vexed said he lady olivia has greatly disturbed him he chooses to be alone lady l afterwards told us that she found the lady in violent anguish of spirit her aunt endeavouring to calm her she however politely addressed herself to lady l and begging her aunt to withdraw for a few moments she owned to her in french her passion for her brother she was not she said ashamed to own it to his sister who must know that his merit would dignify the passion of the noblest woman she had endeavoured she said to conquer hers she had been willing to give way to the prior attachments that he had pleaded for a lady of her own country signora clementina della porretta whom she allowed to have had great merit but who having irrecoverably been put out of her right mind was shut up at naples by a brother who vowed eternal enmity to sir charles and from whom his life would be in the utmost hazard if he went over she owned that her chief motive for coming to england was to cast her fortune at her brothers feet and as she knew him to be a man of honour to comply with any terms he should propose to her he had offered to the family della porretta to allow their daughter her religion and her confessor and to live with her every other year in italy she herself not inferior in birth in person in mind as she said she presumed and superior in fortune the riches of three branches of her family all rich having centred in her insisted not now upon such conditions her aunt she said knew not that she proposed on conviction a change of her religion but she was resolved not to conceal anything from lady l she left her to judge how much she must be affected when he declared his obligation to leave england and especially when he owned that it was to go to bologna and that so suddenly as if as she apprehended at first it was to avoid her she had been in tears she said and even would have kneeled to him to induce him to suspend his journey for one month and then to have taken her over with him and seen her safe in her own palace if he would go upon so hated and so fruitless as well as so hazardous an errand but he had denied her this poor favour this refusal she owned had put her out of all patience she was unhappily passionate but was the most placable of her sex what madam said she can affect a woman if slight indignity and repulse from a favoured person is not able to do it a woman of my condition to come over to england to solicit how can i support the thought and to be refused the protection of the man she prefers to all men and her request to see her safe back again though but as the fool she came over you may blame me madam but you must pity me even were you to have a heart the sister heart of your inflexible brother in vain did lady l plead to her lady clementinas deplorable situation the reluctance of his own relations to part with him and the magnanimity of his selfdenial in a hundred instances on the bare possibility of being an instrument to restore her she could not bear to hear her speak highly of the unhappy lady she charged clementina with the pride of her family to which she attributed their deserved calamity deserved cruel lady how could her pitiless heart allow her lips to utter such a word and imputed meanness to the noblest of human minds for yielding to the entreaties of a family some of the principals of which she said had treated him with an arrogance that a man of his spirit ought not to bear lady maffei came in she seems dependent upon her niece she is her aunt by marriage only and lady l speaks very favourably of her from the advice she gave and her remonstrances to her kinswoman lady maffei besought her to compose herself and return to the company she could not bear she said to return to the company the slighted the contemned object she must appear to be to every one in it i am an intruder said she haughtily a beggar with a fortune that would purchase a sovereignty in some countries make my excuses to your sister to the rest of the company and to that fine young lady whose eyes by their officious withdrawing from his and by the consciousness that glowed in her face whenever he addressed her betrayed at least to a jealous eye more than she would wish to have seen but tell her that all lovely and blooming as she is she must have no hope while clementina lives i hope lucy it is only to a jealous eye that my heart is so discoverable i thank her for her caution but i can say what she cannot that from my heart cost me what it may i do subscribe to a preference in favour of a lady who has acted in the most arduous trials in a greater manner than i fear either olivia or i could have acted in the same circumstances we see that her reason but not her piety deserted her in the noble struggle between her love and her religion in the most affecting absences of her reason the soul of the man she loved was the object of her passion however hard it is to prefer another to ones self in such a case as this yet if my judgment is convinced my acknowledgment shall follow it heaven will enable me to be reconciled to the event because i pursue the dictates of that judgment against the biases of my more partial heart let that heaven which only can restore clementina and dispose as it pleases of olivia and harriet we cannot either of us i humbly hope be so unhappy as the lady has been whom i rank among the first of women and whose whole family deserves almost equal compassion lady olivia asked lady l if her brother had not a very tender regard for me he had lady l answered and told her that he had rescued me from a very great distress and that mine was the most grateful of human hearts she called me sweet young creature supposing me i doubt not younger than i am but said that the graces of my person and mind alarmed her not as they would have done had not his attachment to clementina been what now she saw but never could have believed it was having supposed that compassion only was the tie that bound him to her but compassion lucy from such a heart as his the merit so great in the lady must be love a love of the nobler kind and if it were not it would be unworthy of clementinas lady maffei called upon her dignity her birth to carry her above a passion that met not with a grateful return she advised her to dispose herself to stay in england some months now she was here and as her friends in italy would suppose what her view was in coming to england their censures would be obviated by her continuing here for some time while sir charles was abroad and in italy and that she should divert herself with visiting the court the public places and in seeing the principal curiosities of this kingdom as she had done those of others in order to give credit to an excursion that might otherwise be freely spoken of in her own country she seemed to listen to this advice she bespoke and was promised the friendship of the two sisters and included in her request through their interests mine and lady g was called in by her sister to join in the promise she desired that sir charles might be requested to walk in but would not suffer the sisters to withdraw as they would have done when he returned he could not but be polite but it seems looked still disturbed i beg you to excuse sir said she my behaviour to you it was passionate it was unbecoming but in compliment to your own consequence you ought to excuse it i have only to request one favour of you that you will suspend for one week in regard to me your proposed journey but for one week and i will now i am in england stay some months perhaps till your return excuse me madam i will not excuse you but one week sir give me so much importance with myself as for one weeks suspension you will you must indeed i cannot my soul i own to you is in the distresses of the family of porretta why should i repeat what i said to you before i have bespoken sir the civilities of your sisters of your family you forbid them not you expect not an answer madam to that question my sisters will be glad and so will their lords to attend you wherever you please with a hope to make england agreeable to you how long do you propose to stay in italy sir it is not possible for me to determine are you not apprehensive of danger to your person i am not you ought to be no danger shall deter me from doing what i think to be right if my motives justify me i cannot fear do you wish me sir to stay in england till your return a question so home put disturbed him was it a prudent one in the lady it must either subject her to a repulse or him by a polite answer to give her hope that her stay in england might not be fruitless as to the view she had in coming he reddened it is fit answered he that your own pleasure should determine you it did pardon me madam in your journey hither she reddened to her very ears your brother ladies has the reputation of being a polite man bear witness to this instance of it i am ashamed of myself if i am unpolite madam my sincerity will be my excuse at least to my own heart o that inflexible heart but ladies if the inhospitable englishman refuse his protection in his own country to a foreign woman of no mean quality do not you his sisters despise her they madam and their lords will render you every cheerful service let me request you my sisters to make england as agreeable as possible to this lady she is of the first consideration in her own country she will be of such wherever she goes my lady maffei deserves likewise your utmost respect then addressing himself to them ladies said he encourage my sisters they will think themselves honoured by your commands the two sisters confirmed in an obliging manner what their brother had said and both ladies acknowledged themselves indebted to them for their offered friendship but lady olivia seemed not at all satisfied with their brother and it was with some difficulty he prevailed on her to return to the company and drink coffee i could not help reflecting on occasion of this ladys conduct that fathers and mothers are great blessings to daughters in particular even when women grown it is not every woman that will shine in a state of independency great fortunes are snares if independent women escape the machinations of men which they have often a difficulty to do they will frequently be hurried by their own imaginations which are said to be livelier than those of men though their judgments are supposed less into inconveniencies had lady olivias parents or uncles lived she hardly would have been permitted to make the tour of europe and not having so great a fortune to support vagaries would have shone as she is well qualified to do in a dependent state in italy and made some worthy man and herself happy had she a mind great enough to induce her to pity clementina i should have been apt to pity her for i saw her soul was disturbed i saw that the man she loved was not able to return her love a pitiable case i saw a starting tear now and then with difficulty dispersed once she rubbed her eye and being conscious of observation said something had got into it so it had the something was a tear yet she looked with haughtiness and her bosom swelled with indignation ill concealed sir charles repeated his recommendation of her to lord l and lord g they offered their best services lord w invited her and all of us to windsor different parties of pleasure were talked of but still the enlivener of every party was not to be in any one of them she tried to look pleased but did not always succeed in the trial an eye of love and anger mingled was often cast upon the man whom everybody loved her bosom heaved as it seemed sometimes with indignation against herself that was the construction which i made of some of her looks lady maffei however seemed pleased with the parties of pleasure talked of she often directed herself to me in italian i answered her in it as well as i could i do not talk it well but as i am not an italian and little more than booklearned in it for it is a long time ago since i lost my grandpapa who used to converse with me in it and in french i was not scrupulous to answer in it to have forborne because i did not excel in what i had no opportunity to excel in would have been false modesty nearly bordering upon pride were any lady to laugh at me for not speaking well her native tongue i would not return the smile were she to be less perfect in mine than i am in hers but lady olivia made me a compliment on my faulty accent when i acknowledged it to be so signora said she you shew us that a pretty mouth can give beauty to a defect a master teaching you added she would perhaps find some fault but a friend conversing with you must be in love with you for the very imperfection sir charles was generously pleased with the compliment and made her a fine one on her observation he attended the two ladies to their lodgings in his coach he owned to dr bartlett that lady olivia was in tears all the way lamenting her disgrace in coming to england just as he was quitting it and wishing she had stayed at florence she would have engaged him to correspond with her he excused himself it was a very afflicting thing to him he told the doctor to deny any request that was made to him especially by a lady but he thought he ought in conscience and honour to forbear giving the shadow of an expectation that might be improved into hope where none was intended to be given heaven he said had for laudable ends implanted such a regard in the sexes towards each other that both man and woman who hoped to be innocent could not be too circumspect in relation to the friendships they were so ready to contract with each other he thought he had gone a great way in recommending an intimacy between her and his sisters considering her views her spirit her perseverance and the free avowal of her regard for him and her menaces on his supposed neglect of her and yet as she had come over and he was obliged to leave england so soon after her arrival he thought he could not do less and he hoped his sisters from whose example she might be benefited would while she behaved prudently cultivate her acquaintance the doctor tells me that now lady olivia is so unexpectedly come hither in person he thinks it best to decline giving me as he had once intended her history at large but will leave so much of it as may satisfy my curiosity to be gathered from my own observation and not only from the violence and haughtiness of her temper but from the freedom of her declarations he is sure he said that his patron will be best pleased that a veil should be thrown over the weaker part of her conduct which were it known would indeed be glorious to sir charles but not so to the lady who however never was suspected even by her enemies of giving any other man reason to tax her with a thought that was not strictly virtuous and she had engaged his pity and esteem for the sake of her other fine qualities though she could not his love before she saw him which it seems was at the opera at florence for the first time when he had an opportunity to pay her some slight civilities she set all men at defiance tomorrow morning sir charles is to breakfast with me my cousins and i are to dine at lord ls the earl and lady gertrude are also to be there lord w has been prevailed upon to stay and be there also as it is his nephews last day in england last day in england o my lucy what words are those lady l has invited lady olivia and her aunt at her own motion sir charles his time being so short not disapproving i thank my grandmamma and aunt for their kind summons i will soon set my day i will my dear soon set my day letter xxvi miss byron in continuation friday noon april not five hours in bed not one hours rest for many uneasy nights before i was stupid till sir charles came i then was better he inquired with tender looks and voice after my health as if he thought i did not look well we had some talk about lord and lady g he was anxious for their happiness he complimented me with hopes from my advice to her lord g he said was a goodnatured honest man if he thought his sister would make him unhappy he should himself be so i told him that i dared to answer for her heart my lord must bear with some innocent foibles and all would be well we then talked of lady olivia he began the subject by asking me my opinion of her i said she was a very fine woman in her person and that she had an air of grandeur in her mien and she has good qualities said he but she is violent in her passions i am frequently grieved for her she is a fine creature in danger of being lost by being made too soon her own mistress he said not one word of his departure tomorrow morning i could not begin it my heart would not let me my spirits were not high and i am afraid if that key had been touched i should have been too visibly affected my cousins forbore upon the same apprehension he was excessively tender and soothing to me in his air his voice his manner i thought of what emily said that his voice when he spoke of me was the voice of love dear flattering girl but why did she flatter me we talked of her next he spoke of her with the tenderness of a father he besought me to love her he praised her heart emily said i venerates her guardian she never will do any thing contrary to his advice she is very young replied he she will be happy madam in yours she both loves and reverences you i greatly love the dear emily sir she and i shall be always sisters how happy am i in your goodness to her permit me madam to enumerate to you my own felicities in that of my dearest friends mr beauchamp is now in the agreeable situation i have long wished him to be in his prudence and obliging behaviour to his motherinlaw have won her his father grants him every thing through her and she by this means finds that power enlarged which she was afraid would be lessened if the son were allowed to come over how just is this reward of his filial duty thus lucy did he give up the merit to his beauchamp which was solely due to himself lord w he hoped would be soon one of the happiest men in england and the whole mansfield family had now fair prospects opening before them emily not he you see had made it the interest of her mother to be quiet lord and lady l gave him pleasure whenever he saw them or thought of them dr bartlett was in heaven while on earth he would retire to his beloved grandisonhall and employ himself in distributing as objects offered at least a thousand pounds of the three thousand bequeathed to charitable uses by his late friend mr danby his sisters fortune was paid his estates in both kingdoms were improving see madam said he how like the friend of my soul i claim your attention to affairs that are of consequence to myself and in some of which your generosity of heart has interested you i bowed had i spoken i had burst into tears i had something arose in my throat i know not what still thought i excellent man you are not yourself happy o pity pity yet lucy he plainly had been enumerating all these things to take off from my mind that impression which i am afraid he too well knows it is affected with from his difficult situation and now madam resumed he how are all my dear and good friends whom you more particularly call yours i hope to have the honour of a personal knowledge of them when heard you of our good mr deane he is well i hope very well sir your grandmamma shirley that ornament of advanced years i bowed i dared not to trust my voice your excellent aunt selby i bowed again your uncle your lucy your nancy happy family all harmony all love how do they i wiped my eyes is there any service in my power to do them or any of them command me good miss byron if there be my lord w and i are one our influence is not small make me still more happy in the power of serving any one favoured by you you oppress me sir by your goodness i cannot speak my grateful sensibilities will you my dear mr reeves will you madam to my cousin employ me in any way that i can be of use to you either abroad or at home your acquaintance has given me great pleasure to what a family of worthies has this excellent young lady introduced me o sir said mrs reeves tears running down her cheeks that you were not to leave people whom you have made so happy in the knowledge of the best of men indispensable calls must be obeyed my dear mrs reeves if we cannot be as happy as we wish we will rejoice in the happiness we can have we must not be our own carvers but i make you all serious i was enumerating as i told you my present felicities i was rejoicing in your friendships i have joy and i presume to say i will have joy there is a bright side in every event i will not lose sight of it and there is a dark one but i will endeavour to see it only with the eye of prudence that i may not be involved by it at unawares who that is not reproached by his own heart and is blessed with health can grieve for inevitable evils evils that can be only evils as we make them so forgive my seriousness my dear friends you make me grave favour me i beseech you my good miss byron with one lesson we shall be too much engaged perhaps by and by he led me i thought it was with a cheerful air but my cousins both say his eyes glistened to the harpsichord he sung unasked but with a low voice and my mind was calmed o lucy how can i part with such a man how can i take my leave of him but perhaps he has taken his leave of me already as to the solemnity of it in the manner i have recited letter xxvii miss byron in continuation saturday morning april o lucy sir charles grandison is gone gone indeed he set out at three this morning on purpose no doubt to spare his sisters and friends as well as himself concern we broke not up till after two were i in the writing humour which i have never known to fail me till now i could dwell upon a hundred things some of which i can now only briefly mention dinnertime yesterday passed with tolerable cheerfulness every one tried to be cheerful o what pain attends loving too well and being too well beloved he must have pain as well as we lady olivia was the most thoughtful at dinnertime yet poor emily ah the poor emily she went out four or five times to weep though only i perceived it nobody was cheerful after dinner but sir charles he seemed to exert himself to be so he prevailed on me to give them a lesson on the harpsichord lady l played lady g played we tried to play i should rather say he himself took the violin and afterwards sat down to the harpsichord for one short lesson he was not known to be such a master but he was long in italy lady olivia indeed knew him to be so she was induced to play upon the harpsichord she surpassed every body italy is the land of harmony about seven at night he singled me out and surprised me greatly by what he said he told me that lady d had made him a visit i was before low i was then ready to sink she has asked me questions madam sir sir was all i could say he himself trembled as he spoke alas my dear he surely loves me hear how solemnly he spoke god almighty be your director my dear miss byron i wish not more happiness to my own soul than i do to you in discharge of a promise made i mention this visit to you i might otherwise have spared you and myself he stopt there then resumed for i was silent i could not speak your friends will be entreated for a man that loves you a very worthy young nobleman i give you emotion madam forgive me i have performed my promise he turned from me with a seeming cheerful air how could he appear to be cheerful we made parties at cards i knew not what i played emily sighed and tears stole down her cheeks as she played o how she loves her guardian emily i say i dont know what i write at supper we were all very melancholy mr beauchamp was urgent to go abroad with him he changed the subject and gave him an indirect denial as i may call it by recommending the two italian ladies to his best services sir charles kind good excellent wished to lord l to have seen mr grandison unworthy as that man has made himself of his attention he was a few moments in private with lady olivia she returned to company with red eyes poor emily watched an opportunity to be spoken to by him alone so diligently he led her to the window about one oclock it was he held both her hands he called her she says his emily he charged her to write to him she could not speak she could only sob yet thought she had a thousand things to say to him he contradicted not the hope his sisters and their lords had of his breakfasting with them they invited me they invited the italian ladies lady l lord l did go in expectation but lady g when she found him gone sent me and the italian ladies word that he was it would have been cruel if she had not how could he steal away so i find that he intended that his morning visit to me as indeed i halfsuspected should be a taking leave of my cousins and your harriet how many things did he say then how many questions ask in tender woe he wanted to do us all service he seemed not to know what to say surely he hates not your poor harriet what struggles in his noble bosom but a man cannot complain a man cannot ask for compassion as a woman can but surely his is the gentlest of manly minds when we broke up he handed my cousin reeves into her coach he handed me mr reeves said we see you again sir charles in the morning he bowed at handing me in he sighed he pressed my hand i think he did that was all he saluted nobody he will not meet his clementina as he parted with us but i doubt not dr bartlett was in the secret he was he has just been here he found my eyes swelled i had had no rest yet knew not till seven oclock that he was gone it was very good of the doctor to come his visit soothed me yet he took no notice of my red eyes nay for that matter mrs reevess eyes were swelled as well as mine angel of a man how is he beloved the doctor says that his sisters their lords lord w are in as much grief as if he were departed for ever and who knows but i will not torment myself with supposing the worst i will endeavour to bear in mind what he said yesterday morning to us no doubt for an instruction that he would have joy and did he then think that i should be so much grieved as to want such an instruction and therefore did he vouchsafe to give it but vanity be quiet lie down hope hopelesness take place clementina shall be his he shall be hers yet his emotion lucy at mentioning lady ds visit o but that was only owing to his humanity he saw my emotion and acknowledged the tenderest friendship for me ought i not to be satisfied with that i am i will be satisfied does he not love me with the love of mind the poor olivia has not this to comfort herself with the poor olivia if i see her sad and afflicted how i shall pity her all her expectations frustrated the expectations that engaged her to combat difficulties to travel to cross many waters and to come to england to come just time enough to take leave of him he hastening on the wings of love and compassion to a dearer a deservedly dearer object in the country she had quitted on purpose to visit him in his is not hers a more grievous situation than mine it is why then do i lament but here lucy let me in confidence hint what i have gathered from several intimations from dr bartlett though as tenderly made by him as possible that had sir charles grandison been a man capable of taking advantage of the violence of a ladys passion for him the unhappy olivia would not have scrupled great haughty and noble as she is by birth and fortune to have been his without conditions if she could not have been so with the italian world is of this opinion at least had sir charles been a rinaldo olivia had been an armida o that i could hope for the honour of the sex and of the lady who is so fine a woman that the italian world is mistaken i will presume that it is my good dr bartlett will you allow me to accuse you of a virtue too rigorous that is sometimes the fault of very good people you own that sir charles has not even to you revealed a secret so disgraceful to her you own that he has only blamed her for having too little regard for her reputation and for the violence of her temper yet how patiently for one of such a temper has she taken his departure almost on the day of her arrival he could not have given her an opportunity to indicate to him a concession so criminal she could not if he had have made the overture wicked wicked world i will not believe you and the less credit shall you have with me italian world as i have seen the lady the innocent heart will be a charitable one lady olivia is only too intrepid prosperity as sir charles observed has been a snare to her and set her above a proper regard to her reputation merciless world i do not love you dear dr bartlett you are not yet absolutely perfect these hints of yours against olivia gathered from the malevolence of the envious are proofs the first indeed that i have met with of your imperfection excuse me lucy how have i run on disappointment has mortified me and made me goodnatured i will welcome adversity if it enlarge my charity the doctor tells me that emily with her halfbroken heart will be here presently if i can be of comfort to her but i want it myself from the same cause we shall only weep over each other as i told you the doctor and the doctor only knew of his setting out so early he took leave of him happy dr bartlett yet i see by his eyes that this parting cost him some paternal tears never father better loved a son than this good man loves sir charles grandison sir charles it seems had settled all his affairs three days before his servants were appointed the doctor tells me that he had last week presented the elder mr oldham with a pair of colours which he had purchased for him nobody had heard of this lord w he says is preparing for windsor mr beauchamp for hampshire for a few days and then he returns to attend the commands of the noble italians lady olivia will soon have her equipage ready she will make a great appearance but sir charles grandison will not be with her what is grandeur to a disturbed heart the earl of g and lady gertrude are setting out for hertfordshire lord and lady l talk of retiring for a few weeks to colnebrook the doctor is preparing for grandisonhall your poor harriet for northamptonshire bless me my dear what a dispersion but lord ws nuptials will collect some of them together at windsor emily the dear weeping girl is just come she is with my cousins she expects my permission for coming up to me imagine us weeping over each other praying for blessing the guardian of us both your imagination cannot form a scene too tender adieu my lucy letter xxviii miss byron in continuation sunday april o what a blank my dear but i need not say what i was going to say poor emily but to mention her grief is to paint my own lord w went to windsor yesterday a very odd behaviour of lady olivia mr beauchamp went yesterday and offered to attend her to any of the public places at her pleasure in pursuance of sir charless reference to him to do all in his power to make england agreeable to her and she thought fit to tell him before her aunt that she thanked him for his civility but she should not trouble him during her stay in england she had gentlemen in her train and one of them had been in england before he left her in disgust lady l making her a visit in the evening she told her of mr beauchamps offer and of her answer the gentleman said she is a polite and very agreeable man and this made me treat his kind offer with abruptness for i can hardly doubt your brothers view in it i scorn his view and if i were sure of it perhaps i should find a way to make him repent of the indignity lady l was sure she said that neither her brother nor mr beauchamp had any other views than to make england as agreeable to her as possible be this as it may madam said she i have no service for mr beauchamp but if your ladyship your sister and your two lords will allow me to cultivate your friendship you will do me honour dr bartletts company will be very agreeable to me likewise as often as he will give it me to miss jervois i lay some little claim i would have had her for my companion in italy but your cruel brother no more however of him your english beauty too i admire her but poor young creature i admire her the more because i can pity her i should think myself very happy to be better acquainted with her lady l made her a very polite answer for herself and her sister and their lords but told her that i was very soon to set out for my own abode in northamptonshire and that dr bartlett had some commissions which would oblige him in a day or two to go to sir charless seat in the country she herself offered to attend her to windsor and to every other place at her command lady l took notice of her wrist being bound round with a broad black ribband and asked if it were hurt a kind of sprain said she but you little imagine how it came and must not ask this made lady l curious and olivia requesting that emily might be allowed to breakfast with her as this morning she has bid the dear girl endeavour to know how it came if it fell in her way for olivia reddened and looked up with a kind of consciousness to lady l when she told her that she must not ask questions about it lady g is very earnest with me to give into the town diversions for a month to come but i have now no desire in my heart so strong as to throw myself at the feet of my grandmamma and aunt and to be embraced by my lucy and nancy and all my northamptonshire friends i am only afraid of my uncle he will rally his harriet yet only i know in hopes to divert her and us all but my jesting days are over my situation will not bear it yet if it will divert himself let him rally i shall be so much importuned to stay longer than i ought or will stay that i may as well fix a peremptory day at once will you my ever indulgent friends allow me to set out for selbyhouse on friday next not on a sunday as lady betty williams advises for fear of the odious waggons but i have been in a different school sir charles grandison i find makes it a tacit rule with him never to begin a journey on a sunday nor except when in pursuit of works of mercy or necessity to travel in time of divine service and this rule he observed last sunday though he reached us here in the evening o my grandmamma how much is he what you all are and ever have been but he is now pursuing a work of mercy god succeed to him the end of his pursuit but why tacit you will ask is sir charles grandison ashamed to make an open appearance in behalf of his christian duties he is not for instance i have never seen him sit down at his own table in the absence of dr bartlett or some other clergyman but he himself says grace and that with such an easy dignity as commands every ones reverence and which is succeeded by a cheerfulness that looks as if he were the better pleased for having shewn a thankful heart dr bartlett has also told me that he begins and ends every day either in his chamber or in his study in a manner worthy of one who is in earnest in his christian profession but he never frights gay company with grave maxims i remember one day mr grandison asked him in his absurd way why he did not preach to his company now and then faith sir charles said he if you did you would reform many a poor ignorant sinner of us since you could do it with more weight and more certainty of attention than any parson in christendom it would be an affront said sir charles to the understanding as well as education of a man who took rank above a peasant in such a country as this to seem to question whether he knew his general duties or not and the necessity of practising what he knew of them if he should be at a loss he may once a week be reminded and his heart kept warm let you and me cousin everard shew our conviction by our practice and not invade the clergymans province i remember that mr grandison shewed his conviction by his blushes and by repeating the three little words you and me sir charles sunday evening o my dear friends i have a strange a shocking piece of intelligence to give you emily has just been with me in tears she begged to speak with me in private when we were alone she threw her arms about my neck ah madam said she i am come to tell you that there is a person in the world that i hate and must and will hate as long as i live it is lady olivia take me down with you into northamptonshire and never let me see her more i was surprised o madam i have found out that she would on thursday last have killed my guardian i was astonished lucy they retired together you know madam my guardian came from her his face in a glow and he sent in his sister to her and went not in himself till afterwards she would have had him put off his journey she was enraged because he would not and they were high together and at last she pulled out of her stays in fury a poniard and vowed to plunge it into his heart he should never she said see his clementina more he went to her her heart failed her well it might you know madam he seized her hand he took it from her she struggled and in struggling her wrist was hurt thats the meaning of the broad black ribband wicked creature to have such a thought in her heart he only said when he had got it from her unhappy violent woman i return not this instrument of mischief you will have no use for it in england and would not let her have it again i shuddered o my dear said i he has been a sufferer we are told by good women but this is not a good woman but can it be true who informed you of it lady maffei herself she thought that sir charles must have spoken of it and when she found he had not she was sorry she had and begged i would not tell any body but i could not keep it from you and she says that lady olivia is grieved on the remembrance of it and arraigns herself and her wicked passion and the more for his noble forgiveness of her on the spot and recommending her afterwards to the civilities of his sisters and their lords but i hate her for all that poor unhappy olivia said i but what my emily are we women who should be the meekest and tenderest of the whole animal creation when we give way to passion but if she is so penitent let not the shocking attempt be known to his sisters or their lords i may take the liberty of mentioning it in strict confidence observe that lucy to those from whom i keep not any secret but let it not be divulged to any of the relations of sir charles their detestation of her which must follow would not be concealed and the unhappy creature made desperate might who knows what she might do the dear girl ran on upon what might have been the consequence and what a loss the world would have had if the horrid fact had been perpetrated lady maffei told her however that had not her heart relented she might have done him mischief for he was too rash in approaching her she fell down on her knees to him as soon as he had wrested the poniard from her i forgive and pity you madam said he with an air that had as olivia and her aunt have recollected since both majesty and compassion in it but against her entreaty he would withdraw yet at her request sent in lady l to her and going into his study told not even dr bartlett of it though he went to him there immediately from the consciousness of this violence perhaps the lady was more temperate afterwards even to the very time of his departure lord bless me what shall i do lady d has sent a card to let me know that she will wait upon mrs reeves and me tomarrow to breakfast she comes no doubt to tell me that sir charles having no thoughts of harriet byron lord d may have hopes of succeeding with her and perhaps her ladyship will plead sir charless recommendation and interest in lord ds favour but should this plea be made good heaven give me patience i am afraid i shall be uncivil to this excellent woman letter xxix miss byron in continuation monday april the countess is just gone mr reeves was engaged before to breakfast with lady betty williams and we were only mrs reeves lady d and i my heart ached at her entrance and every moment still more as we were at breakfast her looks i thought had such particular kindness and meaning in them as seemed to express you have no hopes miss byron any where else and i will have you to be mine but my suspense was over the moment the teatable was removed i see your confusion my dear said the countess mrs reeves you must not leave us and i have sat in pain for you as i saw it increase by this i know that sir charles grandison has been as good as his word indeed i doubted not but he would i dont wonder my dear that you love him he is the finest man in his manners as well as person that i ever saw a woman of virtue and honour cannot but love him but i need not praise him to you nor to you neither mrs reeves i see that now you must know proceeded she that there is an alliance proposed for my son of which i think very well but still should have thought better had i never seen you my dear i have talked to my lord about it you know i am very desirous to have him married his answer was i never can think of any proposal of this nature while i have any hope that i can make myself acceptable to miss byron what think you my lord said i if i should directly apply to sir charles grandison to know his intentions and whether he has any hopes of obtaining her favour he is said to be the most unreserved of men he knows our characters to be as unexceptionable as his own and that our alliance cannot be thought a discredit to the first family in the kingdom it is a free question i own as i am unacquainted with him by person but he is such a man that methinks i can take pleasure in addressing myself to him on any subject my lord smiled at the freedom of my motion but not disapproving it i directly went to sir charles and after due compliments told him my business the countess stopt she is very penetrating she looked at us both well madam said my cousin with an air of curiosity pray your ladyship i could not speak for very impatience i never heard in my life said the countess such a fine character of any mortal as he gave you he told me of his engagements to go abroad as the very next day he highly extolled the lady for whose sake principally he was obliged to go abroad and he spoke as highly of a brother of hers whom he loved as if he were his own brother and mentioned very affectionately the young ladys whole family god only knows said he what may be my destiny as generosity as justice or rather as providence leads i will follow after he had generously opened his heart proceeded the countess i asked him if he had any hope should the foreign lady recover her health of her being his i can promise myself nothing said he i go over without one selfish hope if the lady recover her health and her brother can be amended in his by the assistance i shall carry over with me i shall have joy inexpressible to providence i leave the rest the result cannot be in my own power then sir proceeded the countess you cannot in honour be under any engagements to miss byron i arose from my seat whither my dear i have done if i oppress you i moved my chair behind hers but so close to hers that i leaned on the back of it my face hid and my eyes running over she stood up sit down again madam said i and proceed pray proceed you have excited my curiosity only let me sit here unheeded behind you pray madam said mrs reeves burning also with curiosity as she has since owned go on and indulge my cousin in her present seat what answer did sir charles return my dear love said the countess sitting down as i had requested let me first be answered one question i would not do mischief you cannot do mischief madam replied i what is your ladyships question has sir charles grandison ever directly made his addresses to you my dear never madam it is not for want of love i dare aver that he has not but thus he answered my question i should have thought myself the unworthiest of men knowing the difficulties of my own situation how great soever were the temptation from miss byrons merit if i had sought to engage her affections o lucy how nobly is his whole conduct towards me justified she has madam proceeded the countess in his words a prudence that i never knew equalled in a woman so young with a frankness of mind to which hardly ever young lady before her had pretensions she has such a command of her affections that no man i dare say will ever have a share in them till he has courted her favour by assiduities which shall convince her that he has no heart but for her o my lucy what an honour to me would these sentiments be if i deserved them and can sir charles grandison think i do i hope so but if he does how much am i indebted to his favourable his generous opinion who knows but i have reason to rejoice rather than to regret as i used to do his frequent absences from colnebrook the countess proceeded then sir you will not take it amiss if my son by his assiduities can prevail upon miss byron to think that he has merit and that his heart is wholly devoted to her amiss madam no in justice in honour i cannot may miss byron be as she deserves to be one of the happiest women on earth in her nuptials i have heard a great character of lord d he has a very large estate he may boast of his mother god forbid that i a man divided in myself not knowing what i can do hardly sometimes what i ought to do should seek to involve in my own uncertainties the friend i revere the woman i so greatly admire her beauty so attracting so proper therefore for her to engage a generous protector in the married state generous man thought i o how my tears ran down my cheeks as i hid my face behind the countesss chair but will you allow me sir proceeded the countess to ask you were you freed from all your uncertainties permit me madam interrupted he to spare you the question you were going to put as i know not what will be the result of my journey abroad i should think myself a very selfish man and a very dishonourable one to two ladies of equal delicacy and worthiness if i sought to involve as i hinted before in my own uncertainties a young lady whose prudence and great qualities must make herself and any man happy whom she shall favour with her hand to be still more explicit proceeded he with what face could i look up to a woman of honour and delicacy such a one as the lady before whom i now stand if i could own a wish that while my honour has laid me under obligation to one lady if she shall be permitted to accept of me i should presume to hope that another no less worthy would hold her favour for me suspended till she saw what would be the issue of the first obligation no madam i could sooner die than offer such indignity to both i am fettered added he but miss byron is free and so is the lady abroad my attendance on her at this time is indispensable but i make not any conditions for myself my reward will be in the consciousness of having discharged the obligations that i think myself under as a man of honour the countesss voice changed in repeating this speech of his and she stopt to praise him and then went on you are the man indeed sir but then give me leave to ask you as i think it very likely that you will be married before your return to england whether now that you have been so good as to speak favourably of my son and that you call miss byron sister you will oblige him with a recommendation to that sister the countess of d shews by this request her value for a young lady who deserves it and the more for its being i think excuse me madam a pretty extraordinary one but what a presumption would it be in me to suppose that i had such an interest with miss byron when she has relations as worthy of her as she is of them you may guess my dear said the countess that i should not have put this question but as a trial of his heart however i asked his pardon and told him that i would not believe he gave it me except he would promise to mention to miss byron that i had made him a visit on this subject methinks lucy i should have been glad that he had not let me know that he was so forgiving and now my dear said the lady let me turn about she did and put one arm round my neck and with my own handkerchief wiped my eyes and kissed my cheek and when she saw me a little recovered she addressed me as follows now my good young creature o that you would let me call you daughter in my way for i think i must always call you so whether you do or not let me ask you as if i were your real mother have you any expectation that sir charles grandison will be yours dear madam is not this as hard a question to be put to me as that which you put to him yes my dear full as hard and i am as ready to ask your pardon as i was his if you are really displeased with me for putting it are you miss byron excuse me mrs reeves for thus urging your lovely cousin i am at least entitled to the excuse sir charles grandison made for me that it is a demonstration of my value for her i have declared madam returned i and it is from my heart that i think he ought to be the husband of the lady abroad and though i prefer him to all the men i ever saw yet i have resolved if possible to conquer the particular regard i have for him he has in a very noble manner offered me his friendship so long as it may be accepted without interfering with any other attachments on my part and i will be satisfied with that a friendship so pure replied the countess as that of such a man is consistent with any other attachments my lord d will with his whole soul contribute all in his power to strengthen it he admires sir charles grandison he would think it a double honour to be acquainted with him through you dearest miss byron take another worthy young man into your friendship but with a tenderer name i shall then claim a fourth place in it for myself o my dear what a quadruple knot will you tie your ladyship does me too much honour was all i could just then reply i must have an answer my dear i will not take up with a compliment this then madam is my answer i hope i am an honest creature i have not a heart to give then you have expectations my dear well i will call you mine if i can never did i think that i could have made the proposal that i am going to make you but in my eyes as well as in my lords you are an incomparable young woman this is it we will not think of the alliance proposed to us it is yet but a proposal and to which we have not returned any answer till we see what turn the affair sir charles is gone upon takes you once said you could prefer my son to any of the men that had hitherto applied to you for your favour your affections to sir charles were engaged before you knew us will you allow my son this preference which will be the first preference if sir charles engages himself abroad your ladyship surprises me shall i not improve by the example you have just now set before me who was it that said and a man too with what face could i look up to a woman of honour and delicacy such a one as the lady before whom i now stand if i could own a wish that while my heart leaned to one person i should think of keeping another in suspense till i saw whether i could or could not be the others no madam i would sooner die as sir charles said than offer such an indignity to both but i know madam that you only made this proposal as you did another to sir charles grandison as a trial of my heart upon my word my dear i should i think be glad to be entitled to such an excuse but i was really in earnest and now take a little shame to myself what charming ingenuousness in this lady she clasped her arms about me and kissed my cheek again i have but one plea said she to make for myself i could not have fallen into such an error the example so recently given to the contrary had i not wished you to be before any woman in the world countess of d noble creature no title can give you dignity may your own wishes be granted my cousins eyes ran over with pleasure the countess asked when i returned to northamptonshire i told her my intention she charged me to see her first but can tell you said she my lord shall not be present when you come not once more will i trust him in your company and if he should steal a visit unknown to me let not your cousin see him mrs reeves he does indeed admire you love i acknowledged with a grateful heart her goodness to me she engaged me to correspond with her when i got home her commands were an honour done me that i could not refuse myself her son she smilingly told me should no more see my letters than my person at her going away i will tell you one thing said she i never before in a business which my heart was set upon was so effectually silenced by a precedent produced by myself in the same conversation i came with an assurance of success when our hearts are engaged in a hope we are apt to think every step we take for the promoting it reasonable our passions my dear will evermore run away with our judgment but now i think of it i must when i say our make two exceptions one for you and one for sir charles grandison but lucy tell me may i do you think explain the meaning of the word selfish used by sir charles in the conclusion of the library conference at colnebrook and which puzzled me then to make out by his disclaiming of selfishness in the conversation with the countess above recited if i may what an opening of his heart does that word give in my favour were he at liberty does it not look my dear as if his honour checked him when his love would have prompted him to wish me to preserve my heart disengaged till his return from abroad nor let it be said that it was dishonourable in him to have such a thought as it was checked and overcome and as it was succeeded by such an emotion that he was obliged to depart abruptly from me let me repeat the words you may not have my letter at hand which relates that affecting address to me and it is impossible for me while i have memory to forget them he had just concluded his brief history of clementina and now madam what can i say honour forbids me yet honour bids me yet i cannot be unjust ungenerous selfish if i may flatter myself lucy that he did love me when he said this and that he had a conflict in his noble heart between the love on one side so hopeless for i could not forgive him if he did not love as well as pity clementina and on the other not so hopeless were there to have been no bar between shall we not pity him for the arduous struggle shall we not see that honour carried it even in favour of the hopeless against the hopeful and applaud him the more for being able to overcome how shall we call virtue by its name if it be not tried and if it hath no contest with inclination if i am a vain selfflatterer tell me chide me lucy but allow me however at the same time this praise if i can make good my claim to it that my conquest of my passion is at least as glorious for me as his is for him were he to love me ever so well since i can most sincerely however painfully subscribe to the preference which honour love compassion unitedly give to clementina letter xxx miss byron in continuation monday night my cousins and i by invitation supped with lady g this evening lord and lady l were there lady olivia also and lady maffei i have set them all into a consternation as they expressed themselves by my declaration of leaving london on my return home early on friday morning next i knew that were i to pass the whole summer here i must be peremptory at last the two sisters vow that i shall not go so soon they say that i have seen so few of the town diversions town diversions lucy i have had diversion enough of one sort but in your arms my dear friends i shall have consolation and i want it i have great regrets and shall have hourly more as the day approaches on the leaving of such dear and obliging friends but i am determined my cousins coach will convey me to dunstable and there i know i shall meet with my indulgent uncle or your brother i would not have it publicly known because of the officious gentlemen in the neighbourhood dr bartlett intended to set out for grandisonhall tomorrow but from the natural kindness of his heart he has suspended his journey to thursday next no consideration therefore shall detain me if i am well my cousins are grieved they did not expect that i would be a word and a blow as they phrase it lady olivia expressed herself concerned that she in particular was to lose me she had proposed great pleasure she said in the parties she should make in my company but after what emily told me she appears to me as a medusa and were i to be thought by her a formidable rival i might have as much reason to be afraid of the potion as the man she loves of the poniard emily has kept the secret from every body but me and i rely on the inviolable secrecy of all you my friends lord and lady l had designed to go to colnebrook tomorrow or at my day having hopes of getting me with them but now they say they will stay in town till they can see whether i am to be prevailed upon or will be obdurate lady olivia inquired after the distance of northamptonshire she will make the tour of england she says and visit me there i was obliged to say i should take her visit as an honour wicked politeness of how many falsehoods dost thou make the people who are called polite guilty but there is one man in the world who is remarkable for his truth yet is unquestionably polite he censures not others for complying with fashions established by custom but he gives not in to them he never perverts the meaning of words he never for instance suffers his servants to deny him when he is at home if he is busy he just finds time to say he is to unexpected visiters and if they will stay he turns them over to his sisters to dr bartlett to emily till he can attend them but then he has always done so every one knows that he lives to his own heart and they expect it of him and when they can have his company they have double joy in the ease and cheerfulness that attend his leisure they then have him wholly and he can be the more polite as the company then is all his business sir charles might the better do so as he came over so few months ago after so long an absence and his reputation for politeness was so well established that people rather looked for rules from him than a conformity to theirs his denials of complimenting lady olivia though she was but just arrived in his native country where she never was before with the suspending of his departure for one week or but for one day who but he could have given them but he was convinced that it was right to hasten away for the sake of clementina and his jeronymo and that it would have been wrong to shew olivia even for her own sake that in such a competition she had consequence with him and all her entreaties all her menaces the detested poniard in her hand could not shake his steady soul and make him delay his wellsettled purpose letter xxxi miss byron in continuation tuesday morning april this naughty lady g she is excessively to blame lord l is out of patience with her so is lady l emily says she loves her dearly but she does not love her ways lord g

the drawingroom did you not follow me there with looks very pretty looks for a newmarried man i assure you then did you not want to take me aside would not anybody have supposed it was to express your sorrow for your odd behaviour was i not all obedience did you not with very mannish airs slight me for my compliance and fly out of the room all the company could witness the calmness with which i returned to them that they might not be grieved for me nor think our misunderstanding a deep one well then when your stomach came down as i supposed you sent for me out no doubt thought i to express his concern now i was all obedience again and did i not beseech you madam beseech me my lord yes but with such looks i married sir let me tell you a man with another face see see emily he is gone again my lord flew out of the room in a rage o these men my dear said she to emily i know said emily what i could have answered if i dared but it is ill meddling as i have heard say between man and wife emily says the quarrel was not made up but was carried higher still in the morning she had but just finished her tale when the following billet was brought me from lady g tuesday morning harriet if you love me if you pity me come hither this instant i have great need of your counsel i am resolved to be unmarried and therefore subscribe myself by the beloved name of charlotte grandison i instantly dispatched the following i know no such person as charlotte grandison i love lady g but can pity only her lord i will not come near you i have no counsel to give you but that you will not jest away your own happiness harriet byron in half an hour after came a servant from lady g with the following letter so then i have made a blessed hand of wedlock my brother gone my man excessive unruly lord and lady l on his side without inquiring into merits or demerits lectured by dr bartletts grave face emily standing aloof her finger in her eye and now my harriet renouncing me and all in one week what can i do war seems to be declared and will you not turn mediatrix you wont you say let it alone nevertheless i will lay the whole matter before you it was last night the week from the weddingday not completed that lord g thought fit to break into my retirement without my leave by the way he was a little impertinent at dinnertime but that i passed over what boldness is this said i pray sir begone why leave you your company below i come my dearest life to make a request to you the man began with civility enough had he had a little less of his odious rapture for he flung his arms about me jenny in presence a husbands fondness is enough to ruin these girls dont you think harriet that there is an immorality in it before them i refuse your request be it what it will how dare you invade me in my retirement you may believe that i intended not to stay long above my sister below does the ceremony so lately past authorize want of breeding want of breeding madam and he did so stare leave me this instant i looked goodnatured i suppose in my anger for he declared he would not and again throwing his arms about me as i sat joined his sharp face to mine and presumed to kiss me jenny still in the room now harriet you never will desert me in a point of delicacy i am sure you cannot defend these odious freedoms in a matrimony so young unless you would be willing to be served so yourself you may suppose that then i let loose my indignation upon him and he stole out daring to mutter and be displeased the word devil was in his mouth did he call me devil jenny no indeed madam said the wench and harriet see the ill example of such a free behaviour before her she presumed to prate in favour of the mans fit of fondness yet at other times is a prude of a girl before my anger was gone down in again it is truth harriet came the bold wretch i will not said he as you are not particularly employed leave you upon my soul madam you dont use me well but if you will oblige me with your company tomorrow morning no where sir only to breakfast with miss byron my dear as a mark of your obligingness i request it his dear now i hate a hypocrite of all things i knew that he had a design to make a shew of his bride as his property at another place and seeing me angry thought he would name a visit agreeable to me and which at the same time would give him a merit with you and preserve to himself the consequence of being obliged by his obedient wife at the word of authority from this foolish beginning arose our mighty quarrel what vexed me was the art of the man and the evident design he had to get you of his side he in the course of it threatened me with appealing to you to intend to ruin me in the love of my dearest friend who that valued that friend could forgive it you may believe that if he had not proposed it and after such accumulated offences it was the very visit that i should have been delighted with indeed sir upon my word my lord i do assure you sir with a moderate degree of haughtiness was what the quarrel arose to on my side and at last to a declaration of rebellion i wont on his side upon my soul madam let me perish if and then hesitating you use me ill madam i have not deserved and give me leave to say i insist upon being obliged madam there was no bearing of this harriet it was a cool evening but i took up my fan heyday said i what language is this you insist upon it my lord i think i am married am i not and i took my watch half an hour after ten on monday night the what day of the month is this please the lord i will note down this beginning moment of your authoritative demeanour my dear lady g the wretch called me by his own name perhaps farther to insult me if i could bear this treatment it is impossible for me to love you as i do so it is in love to me that you are to put on already all the husband jenny do you see my lord affecting a whisper how you dash the poor wench how like a fool she looks at our folly remember jenny that tomorrow morning you carry my weddingsuits to mrs arnold and tell her she has forgot the hangingsleeves to the gowns let her put them on out of hand i was proceeding but he rudely gravely and even with an air of scorn there was no bearing that you know admonished me a little less wit madam and a little more discretion would perhaps better become you this was too true to be forgiven youll say it harriet if i dont and to come from a man that was not overburdened with either but i had too great a command of myself to say so my dependence my lord this i did say is upon your judgment that will always be a balance to my wit and with the assistance of your reproving love will in time teach me discretion now my dear was not this a high compliment to him ought he not to have taken it as such especially as i looked grave and dropt him a very fine courtesy but either his conscience or his illnature perhaps youll say both made him take it as a reflection true as you are alive harriet he bit his lip jenny begone said he jenny dont go said i jenny knew not which to obey upon my word harriet i began to think the man would have cuffed me and while he was in his airs of mockmajesty i stept to the door and whipt down to my company as married people are not to expose themselves to their friends who i once heard you sagely remark would remember disagreeable things when the honest pair had forgotten them i was determined to be prudent you would have been charmed with me my dear for my discretion i will cheat bystanders thought i i will make my lord and lady l dr bartlett and emily whom i had before set in at cards think we are egregiously happy and down i sat intending with a lamblike peaceableness to make observations on the play but soon after in whipt my indiscreet lord his colour heightened his features working and though i cautioned him not to expose himself yet he assumed airs that were the occasion as you shall hear of frightening away my company he withdrew in consequence of those airs and after a little while repenting as i hoped he sent for me out some wives would have played the queen vashti on their tyrant and refused to go but i all obedience my vow so recently made in my head obeyed at the very first word yet you must think that i meek as i am naturally could not help recriminating he was too lordly to be expostulated with there was i tell you madam and i wont be told sir and when i broke from the passionate creature and hoped to find my company behold they were all gone none but emily left and thus might poor lady l be sent home weeping perhaps for such an early marriagetyranny exerted on her meek sister well and dont you think that we looked like a couple of fools at each other when we saw ourselves left alone as i may say to fight it out i did expostulate with him as mildly as i could he would have made it up with me afterwards but no there was no doing that as a girl of your nice notions may believe after he had by his violent airs exposed us both before so many witnesses in decency therefore i was obliged to keep it up and now our misunderstanding blazes and is at such a comfortable height that if we meet by accident we run away from each other by design we have already made two breakfasttables yet i am meek he is sullen i make courtesies he returns not bows sullen creature and a rustic i go to my harpsichord melody enrages him he is worse than saul for saul could be gloomily pleased with the music even of the man he hated i would have got you to come to us that i thought was tending to a compliance for it would have been condescending too much as he is so very perverse if i had accompanied him to you he has a great mind to appeal to you but i have half rallied him out of his purpose i sent to you what an answer did you return me cruel harriet to deny your requested mediation in a difference that has arisen between man and wife but let the fire glow if it spares the house and only blazes in the chimney i can bear it cross creature adieu if you know not such a woman as grandison heaven grant that i may and that my wishes may be answered as to the person and then i will not know a byron see lucy how high this dear flighty creature bribes but i will not be influenced by her bribery to take her part letter xxxii miss byron in continuation tuesday night i am just returned from st jamesssquare but first i should tell you that i had a visit from lady olivia and lady maffei our conversation was in italian and french lady olivia and i had a quarter of an hours discourse in private you may guess at our subject she is not without that tenderness of heart which is the indispensable characteristic of a woman she lamented the violence of her temper in a manner so affecting that i cannot help pitying her though at the instant i had in my head a certain attempt that makes me shudder whenever i think of it she regrets my going to northamptonshire so soon i have promised to return her visit tomorrow in the afternoon she sets out on friday next for oxford she wished i could accompany her she resolves to see all that is worth seeing in the western circuit as i may call it she observes she says that sir charles grandisons sisters and their lords are very particularly engaged at present and are in expectation of a call to windsor to attend lord ws nuptials she will therefore having attendants enough and two men of consideration in her train one of whom is not unacquainted with england take cursory tours over the kingdom having a taste for travelling and finding it a great relief to her spirits and when lady l and lady g are more disengaged will review the seats and places which she shall think worthy of a second visit in their company she professed to like the people here and the face of the country and talked favourably of the religion of it but poor woman she likes all those the better i doubt not for the sake of one englishman love lucy gilds every object which bears a relation to the person beloved lady maffei was very free in blaming her niece for this excursion she took her chiding patiently but yet like a person that thought it too much in her power to gratify the person blaming her to pay much regard to what she said i took a chair to lady gs emily ran to meet me in the hall she threw her arms about me i rejoice you are come said she did you not meet the house in the square what means my emily why it has been flung out of the windows as the saying is ah madam we are all to pieces one so careless the other so passionate but hush

lord said i as mildly as i now speak dont expose yourself but he was not at all the wiser for my advice lord g miss byron you see but i had not come down but to make my compliments to you he bowed and was about to withdraw i took him by the sleeve my lord you must not go lady g if your own heart justifies you for your part in this misunderstanding say so i challenge you to say so she was silent har if otherwise own your fault promise amendment ask pardon lady g heyday har and my lord will ask yours for mistaking you for being too easily provoked lord g too easily madam har what generous man would not smile at the foibles of a woman whose heart is only gay with prosperity and lively youth but has not the least malice in it has not she made choice of your lordship in preference of any other man she rallies every one she cant help it she is to blame indeed lady g you are your brother felt your edge he once smarted by it and was angry with you but afterwards observing that it was her way my lord that it was a kind of constitutional gaiety of heart and exercised on those she loved best he forgave rallied her again and turned her own weapons upon her and every one in company was delighted with the spirit of both you love her my lord lord g never man more loved a woman i am not an illnatured man lady g but a captious a passionate one lord g whod have thought it lord g never was there my dear miss byron such a strangelyaggravating creature she could not be so if she did not despise me lady g fiddlefaddle silly man and so you said before if you thought so you take the way dont you to mend the matter by dancing and capering about and putting yourself into all manner of disagreeable attitudes and even sometimes being ready to foam at the mouth i told him miss byron there he stands let him deny it if he can that i married a man with another face would not any other man have taken this for a compliment to his natural undistorted face and instantly have pulled off the ugly mask of passion and shewn his own lord g you see you see the air miss byron how ludicrously does she now even now lady g see miss byron how captious lord g ought to have a termagant wife one who could return rage for rage meekness is my crime i cannot be put out of temper meekness was never before attributed to woman as a fault lord g good god meekness good god lady g but harriet do you judge on which side the grievance lies lord g presents me with a face for his that i never saw him wear before marriage he has cheated me therefore i shew him the same face that i ever wore and treat him pretty much in the same manner or i am mistaken that i ever did and what reason can he give that will not demonstrate him to be the most ungrateful of men for the airs he gives himself airs that he would not have presumed to put on eight days ago who then harriet has reason to complain of grievance my lord or i lord g you see miss byron can there be any arguing with a woman who knows herself to be in jest in all she says har why then my lord make a jest of it what will not bear an argument will not be worth ones anger lord g i leave it to miss byron lady g to decide between us as she pleases lady g youd better leave it to me sir har do my lord lord g well madam and what is your decree lady g you miss byron had best be lady chancellor after all i should not bear to have my decree disputed after it is pronounced har if i must my decree is this you lady g shall own yourself in fault and promise amendment my lord shall forgive you and promise that he will for the future endeavour to distinguish between your good and your illnature that he will sit down to jest with your jest and never be disturbed at what you say when he sees it accompanied with that archness of eye and lip which you put on to your brother and to every one whom you best love when you are disposed to be teazingly facetious lady g why harriet you have given lord g a clue to find me out and spoil all my sport har what say you my lord lord g will lady g own herself in fault as you propose lady g odious recrimination i leave you together i never was in fault in my life am i not a woman if my lord will ask pardon for his froppishness as we say of children she stopt and pretended to be going har that my lord shall not do charlotte you have carried the jest too far already my lord shall preserve his dignity for his wifes sake my lord you will not permit lady g to leave us however he took her hand and pressed it with his lips for gods sake madam let us be happy it is in your power to make us both so it ever shall be in your power if i have been in fault impute it to my love i cannot bear your contempt and i never will deserve it lady g why could not this have been said some hours ago why slighting my early caution would you expose yourself i took her aside be generous lady g let not your husband be the only person to whom you are not so lady g whispering our quarrel has not run half its length if we make up here we shall make up clumsily one of the silliest things in the world is a quarrel that ends not as a coachman after a journey comes in with a spirit we shall certainly renew it har take the caution you gave to my lord dont expose yourself and another that you cannot more effectually do so than by exposing your husband i am more than halfashamed of you you are not the charlotte i once thought you were let me see if you have any regard to my good opinion of you that you can own an error with some grace lady g i am a meek humble docile creature she turned to me and made me a rustic courtesy her hands before her ill try for it tell me if i am right then stepping towards my lord who was with his back to us looking out at the window and he turning about to her bowing my lord said she miss byron has been telling me more than i knew before of my duty she proposes herself one day to make a wonderful obedient wife it would have been well for you perhaps had i had her example to walk by she seems to say that now i am married i must be grave sage and passive that smiles will hardly become me that i must be prim and formal and reverence my husband if you think this behaviour will become a married woman and expect it from me pray my lord put me right by your frowns whenever i shall be wrong for the future if i ever find myself disposed to be very lighthearted i will ask your leave before i give way to it and now what is next to be done humorously courtesying her hands before her he clasped her in his arms dear provoking creature this this is next to be done i ask you but to love me half as much as i love you and i shall be the happiest man on earth my lord said i you ruin all by this condescension on a speech and air so ungracious if this is all you get by it never never my lord fall out again o charlotte if you are not generous you come off much much too easily well now my lord said she holding out her hand as if threatening me let you and me man and wife like join against the interposer in our quarrels harriet i will not forgive you for this last part of your lecture and thus was this idle quarrel made up all that vexes me on the occasion is that it was not made up with dignity on my lords part his honest heart so overflowed with joy at his lips that the naughty creature by her arch leers every now and then shewed that she was sensible of her consequence to his happiness but lucy dont let her sink too low in your esteem she has many fine qualities they prevailed on me to stay supper emily rejoiced in the reconciliation her heart was as i may say visible in her joy can i love her better than i do if i could she would every time i see her give me reason for it letter xxxiii miss byron in continuation wednesday noon april it would puzzle you to guess at a visitor i had this morning honest mr fowler i was very glad to see him he brought me a letter from his worthy uncle good sir rowland i had a joy that i thought i should not have had while i stayed in london on its being put into my hand though the contents gave me sensible pain i enclose it it is dated from caermarthen be pleased to read it here caermarthen april how shall i in fit manner inscribe my letter to the loveliest of women i dont mean because of your loveliness but whether as daughter or not as you did me the honour to call yourself really and truly i must say that i had rather call you by another name though a little more remote as to consanguinity lord have mercy upon me how have i talked of you how many of our fine caermarthen girls have i filled with envy of your peerless perfections here am i settled to my hearts content could i but obtain you know whom i mean a town of gentry a fine country round us a fine estate of our own esteemed nay for that matter beloved by all our neighbours and tenants who so happy as rowland meredith if his poor boy could be happy ah madam and cant it be so i am afraid of asking yet i understand that notwithstanding all the jackadandies that have been fluttering about you you are what you were when i lest town some whispers have gone out of a fine gentleman indeed who had a great kindness for you but yet that something was in the way between you the lord bless and prosper my dear daughter as i must then call you and not niece if you have any kindness for him and if as how you have it would be wonderfully gracious if you would but give half a hint of it to my nephew or if so be you will not to him to me your father you know under your own precious hand the lord be good unto me but i shall never see the she that will strike my fancy as you have done but what a dreadful thing would it be if you who are so much courted and admired by many fine gallants should at last be taken with a man who could not be yours god forbid that such a disastrous thing should happen i profess to you madam that a tear or two have strayed down my cheeks at the thoughts of it for why because you played no tricks with any man you never were a coquette as they call them you dealt plainly sincerely and tenderly too to all men of which my nephew and i can bear witness well but what now is the end of my writing lord love you cannot cannot you at last give comfort to two honest hearts honester you never knew and yet if you could i dare say you would well then and if you cant we must sit down as contented as we can thats all we have for it but poor young man look at him if you read this before him strangely altered poor young man and if as how you cannot why then god bless my daughter thats all and i do assure you that you have our prayers every lords day from the bottom of our hearts and now if you will keep a secret i will tell it you and yet when i began i did not intend it the poor youth must not know it it is done in the singleness of our hearts and if you think we mean to gain your love for us by it i do assure you that you wrong us my nephew declares that he never will marry if it be not somebody and he has made his will and so have i his uncle and let me tell you that if as how i cannot have a niece my daughter shall be the better for having known and treated as kindly as power was lent her her true friend loving father and obedient servant rowland meredith love and service to mr and mrs reeves and all friends who inquire after me farewell god bless you amen have you could you lucy read this letter with dry eyes generous worthy honest men i read but half way before mr fowler glad i was that i read no further i should not have been able to have kept his uncles secret if i had had it been but to disclaim the acceptance of the generous purpose the carrying it into effect would exceedingly distress me besides the pain the demise of the honest man would give me and the more as i bespoke the fatherly relation from him myself if such a thing were to be sir charles grandisons generosity to the danbys should be my example do you know mr fowler said i the contents of the letter you have put into my hand no farther than that my uncle told me it contained professions of fatherly love and with wishes only but without so much as expressing his hopes sir rowland is a good man said i i have not read above half his letter there seems to be too much of the father in it for me to read further before my brother god bless my brother fowler and reward the fatherly love of sir rowland to his daughter byron i must write to him mr fowler poor man profoundly sighed bowed with such a look of respectful acquiescence bless me my dear how am i to be distressed on all sides by good men too as sir charles could say by good women is there nothing less than giving myself to either that i can do to shew mr orme and mr fowler my true value for them poor mr fowler indeed he looks to be as sir rowland hints not well such a modest such a humble such a silent lover he cost me tears at parting i could not hide them he heaped praises and blessings upon me and hurried away at last to hide his emotion with a sentence unfinished god preserve you dear and worthy sir was all i could try to say the last words stuck in my throat till he was out of hearing and then i prayed for blessings upon him and his uncle and repeated them with fresh tears on reading the rest of the affecting letter mr fowler told mr reeves before i saw him that he is to go to caermarthen for the benefit of his native air in a week he let him know where he lodged in town he had been riding for his health and diversion about the country ever since his uncle went and has not been yet at caermarthen i wish mr fowler had once if but once called me sister it would have been such a kind acquiescence as would have given me some little pleasure on recollection methinks i dont know how to have done writing of sir rowland and mr fowler i sat down however while the uncle and nephew filled my thoughts and wrote to the former i have enclosed the copy of my letter adieu my lucy letter xxxiv miss byron to sir rowland meredith wednesday april it was with great pleasure that i received this day the kindest letter that ever was written by a real father to his dearest child i was resolved that i would not go to rest till i had acknowledged the favour how sweet is the name of father to a young person who out of near oneandtwenty years of life has for more than half the time been bereaved of hers and who was also one of the best of men you gave me an additional pleasure in causing this remembrance of your promised paternal goodness to be given me by mr fowler in person till i knew you and him i had no father no brother how good you are in your apprehensions that there may be a man on whom your daughter has cast her eye and who cannot look upon her with the same distinction o that i had been near you when you wrote that sweetlycompassionating that indulgent passage i would have wiped the tears from your eyes myself and reverenced you as my true father you demand of me as my father a hint or half a hint as you call it to be given to my brother fowler or if not to him to you to him whom i call father i mean all the duty of a child i call him not father nominally only i will irksome as the subject is own without reserve the truth to you in tenderness to my brother how could i to him there is a man whom and whom only i could love as a good wife ought to love her husband he is the best of men o my good sir rowland meredith if you knew him you would love him yourself and own him for your son i will not conceal his name from my father sir charles grandison is the man inquire about him his character will rise upon you from every mouth he engaged first all your daughters gratitude by rescuing her from a great danger and oppression for he is as brave as he is good and how could she help suffering a tenderness to spring up from her gratitude of which she was never before sensible to any man in the world there is something in the way my good sir but not that proceeds from his slights or contempts your daughter could not live if it were so a glorious creature is in the way who has suffered for him who does suffer for him he ought to be hers and only hers and if she can be recovered from a fearful malady that has seized her mind he probably will my daily prayers are that god will restore her but yet my dear sir my friend my father my esteem for this noblest of men is of such a nature that i cannot give my hand to any other my father meredith would not wish me to give a hand without a heart this sir is the case let it i beseech you rest within your own breast and my brother fowlers how few minds are there delicate and candid enough to see circumstances of this kind in the light they ought to appear in and pray for me my good sir rowland not that the way may be smoothed to what once would have crowned my wishes as to this life but that sir charles grandison may be happy with the lady that is and ought to be dearest to his heart and that your daughter may be enabled to rejoice in their felicity what my good sir is this span of life that a passenger through it should seek to overturn the interests of others to establish her own and can the single life be a grievance can it be destitute of the noblest tendernesses no sir you that have lived to an advanced age in a fair fame surrounded with comforts and as tender to a worthy nephew as the most indulgent father could be to the worthiest of sons can testify for me that it is not but now sir one word i disclaim but yet in all thankfulness the acceptance of the favour signified to be intended me in the latter part of the paternal letter before me our acquaintance began with a hope on your side that i could not encourage as i could not shall i accept of the benefit from you to which i could only have been entitled and that as i had behaved had i been able to oblige you no sir i will not in this case be benefited when i cannot benefit put me not therefore i beseech you sir if such an event deplored by me as it would be should happen upon the necessity of inquiring after your other relations and friends sir rowland meredith my father and mr fowler my brother are all to me of the family they distinguish by their relation that i know at present let me not be made known to the rest by a distinction that would be unjust to them and to yourself as it must deprive you of the grace of obliging those who have more than a strangers claim and must in the event lay them under the appearance of an obligation to that stranger for doing them common justice i use the word stranger with reference to those of your family and friends to whom i must really appear in that light but laying these considerations aside in which i am determined not to interfere with them i am with the tenderest regard dear and good sir your everdutiful and affectionate daughter harriet byron letter xxxv miss byron to miss selby wednesday april i shall dispatch this by your gibson early in the morning it was kind in you to bid him call in his way down for now i shall be almost sure of meeting if not my uncle your brother and who knows but my lucy herself at dunstable where barring accidents i shall be on friday night you will see some of the worthiest people in the world my dear if you come all prepared to love you but let not any body be put to inconvenience to meet me at dunstable my noble friends here will proceed with me to stratford or even to northampton they say but they will see me safe in the protection of somebody i love and whom they must love for my sake i dont wonder that sir charles grandison loves mr beauchamp he is a very worthy and sensible man he as every body else idolizes sir charles it is some pleasure to me lucy that i stand high in his esteem to be respected by the worthy is one of the greatest felicities in this life since it is to be ranked as one of them sir harry and his lady are come to town all it seems is harmony in that family they cannot bear mr beauchamps absence from them for three days together all the neighbouring gentlemen are in love with him his manners are so gentle his temper so even so desirous to oblige so genteel in his person so pleasing in his address he must undoubtedly make a good woman very happy but emily poor girl sees only sir charles grandison with eyes of love mr beauchamp is however greatly pleased with emily he told lady g that he thought her a fine young creature and that her mind was still more amiable than her person but his behaviour to her is extremely prudent he says finer things of her than to her yet surely i am mistaken if he meditates not in her his future wife mr beauchamp will be one of my escort emily at her own request is to go to colnebrook with lady l after i am gone mr reeves will ride lord l and lord g will also oblige me with their company on horseback mrs reeves is forbidden to venture but lady l and lady g will not be denied coming with me i shall take leave of lady olivia and lady maffei tomorrow morning when they will set out for their projected tour tomorrow we and the whole grandison family are to dine together at lord ls for the last time it will be a mournful diningtime on that account lady betty williams her daughter and miss clements supped with us this night and took leave of me in the tenderest manner they greatly regret my going down so soon as they call it as to the public diversions which they wish me to stay and give into to be sure i should have been glad to have been better qualified to have entertained you with the performances of this or that actor this or that musician and the like but frightened by the vile plot upon me at a masquerade i was thrown out of that course of diversion and indeed into more affecting more interesting engagements into the knowledge of a family that had no need to look out of itself for entertainments and besides are not all the company we see as visiters or guests full of these things i have seen the principal performers in every way often enough to give me a notion of their performances though i have not troubled you with such common things as revolve every season you know i am far from slighting the innocent pleasures in which others delight it would have been happier for me perhaps had i had more leisure to attend those amusements than i have found yet i am not sure neither for methinks with all the pangs that my suspenses have cost me i would not but have known sir charles grandison his sisters his emily and dr bartlett i could only have wished to have been spared sir hargrave pollexfens vile attempt then if i had come acquainted with this family it would have been as i came acquainted with others my gratitude had not been engaged so deeply well but what signify ifs what has been has what must be must only love me my dear friends as you used to love me if i was a good girl when i left you i hope i am not a bad one now that i am returning to you my morals i bless god are unhurt my heart is not corrupted by the vanities of the great town i have a little more experience than i had and if i have severely paid for it it is not at the price of my reputation and i hope if nobody has benefited by me since i have been in town that no one has suffered by me poor mr fowler i could not help it you know had i by little snares follies coquetries sought to draw him on and entangle him his future welfare would with reason be more the subject of my solicitude than it is now necessary it should be though indeed i cannot help making it a good deal so thursday morning dr bartlett has just now taken leave of me in my own dressingroom the parting scene between us was tender i have not given you my opinion of miss williams had i seen her at my first coming to town i should have taken as much notice of her in my letters to you as i did of the two miss brambers miss darlington miss cantillon miss allestree and others of my own sex and of mr somner mr barnet mr walden of the other who took my first notice as they fell early in my way and with whom it is possible as well as with the towndiversions i had been more intimate had not sir hargraves vile attempt carried me out of their acquaintance into a much higher which of necessity as well as choice entirely engrossed my attention but now how insipid would any new characters appear to you if they were but of a like cast with those i have mentioned were i to make such the subjects of my pen and had i time before me which i cannot have to write again before i embrace you all my dear my ever dear and indulgent friends i will only say that miss williams is a genteel girl but will hardly be more than one of the better sort of modern women of condition and that she is to be classed so high will be owing more to miss clementss lessons than i am afraid to her mothers example is it lucy that i have more experience and discernment now or less charity and goodnature than when i first came to town for then i thought well in the main of lady betty williams but though she is a goodnatured obliging woman she is so immersed in the love of public diversions so fond of routs drums hurricanes bless me my dear how learned should i have been in all the gaieties of the modern life what a fine lady possibly had i not been carried into more rational however to me they have been more painful scenes and had i followed the lead of this lady as she kindly as to her intention had designed i should in the afternoon mr beauchamp is to introduce sir harry and lady beauchamp on their first visit to the two sisters i had almost forgot to tell you that my cousins and i are to attend the good countess of d for one half hour after we have taken leave of lady olivia and her aunt and now my lucy do i shut up my correspondence with you from london my heart beats high with the hope of being as indulgently received by all you my dearest friends as i used to be after a shorter absence for i am and ever will be the grateful dutiful and affectionate harriet byron letter xxxvi miss byron to lady g selbyhouse monday april though the kind friends with whom i parted at dunstable were pleased one and all to allow that the correspondence which is to pass between my dear lady g and their harriet should answer the just expectations of each upon her in the writing way and though at your motion remember not at mine they promised to be contented with hearing read to them such parts of my letters as you should think proper to communicate yet cannot i dispense with my duty to lady l my emily my cousin reeves and dr bartlett accordingly i write to them by this post and i charge you my dear with my sincere and thankful compliments to your lord and to mr beauchamp for their favours what an agreeable night in the main was friday night had we not been to separate next morning it would have been an agreeable one indeed is not my aunt selby an excellent woman but you all admired her she admires you all i will tell you another time what she said of you my dear in particular my cousin lucy too is she not an amiable creature indeed you all were delighted with her but i take pleasure in recollecting your approbations of one i so dearly love she is as prudent as lady l and now our nancy is so well recovered as cheerful as lady g you said you would provide a good husband for her dont forget the man whoever he be cannot be too good for my lucy nancy is such another good girl but so i told you well and pray did you ever meet with so pleasant a man as my uncle selby what should we have done when we talked of your brother when we talked of our parting had it not been for him you looked upon me every now and then when he returned your smartness upon him as if you thought i had let him know some of your perversenesses to lord g and do you think i did not indeed i did can you imagine that your frankhearted harriet who hides not from her friends her own faults should conceal yours but what a particular character is yours every body blames you that knows of your overlivelinesses yet every body loves you i think for your very faults had it not been so do you imagine i could ever have loved you after you had led lady l to join with you on a certain teasing occasion my uncle dotes upon you but dont tell emily that my cousin james selby is in love with her that he may not on the score of the dear girls fortune be thought presumptuous let me tell you that he is almost of age and when he is comes into possession of a handsome estate he has many good qualities i have in short a very great value for him but not enough though he is my relation to wish him my still more beloved emily dear creature methinks i still feel her parting tears on my cheek you charge me to be as minute in the letters i write to you as i used to be to my friends here and you promise to be as circumstantial in yours i will set you the example do you be sure to follow it we baited at stoney stratford i was afraid how it would be there were the two bold creatures mr greville and mr fenwick ready to receive us a handsome collation as at our setting out so now bespoke by them was set on the table how they came by their intelligence nobody knows we were all concerned to see them they seemed halfmad for joy my cousin james had alighted to hand us out but mr greville was so earnest to offer his hand that though my cousin was equally ready i thought i could not deny to his solicitude for the poor favour such a mark of civility besides if i had it would have been distinguishing him for more than a common neighbour you know mr fenwick took the other hand when i had stept out of the coach and then with so much pride as made me ashamed of myself they hurried me between them through the inn yard and into the room they had engaged for us blessing themselves all the way for my coming down harriet byron i looked about as if for the dear friends i had parted with at dunstable this is not thought i so delightful an inn as they made that now they thought i are pursuing their road to london as we are ours to northampton but ah where where is sir charles grandison at this time and i sighed but dont read this and such strokes as this to any body but lord and lady l you wont you say thank you charlotte i will call you charlotte when i think of it as you commanded me the joy we had at dunstable was easy serene deep full as i may say it was the joy of sensible people but the joy here was made by the two gentlemen mad loud and even noisy they hardly were able to contain themselves and my uncle and cousin james were forced to be loud to be heard mr orme good mr orme when we came near his park was on the highway side perhaps near the very spot where he stood to see me pass to london so many weeks ago poor man when i first saw him which was before the coach came near for i looked out only as thinking i would mark the place where i last beheld him he looked with so disconsolate an air and so fixed that i compassionately said to myself surely the worthy man has not been there ever since i twitched the string just in time the coach stopt mr orme said i how do you well i hope how does miss orme i had my hand on the coachdoor he snatched it it was not an unwilling hand he pressed it with his lips god be praised said he with a countenance o how altered for the better for permitting me once more to behold that face that angelic face he said god bless you mr orme said i i am glad to see you adieu the coach drove on poor mr orme said my aunt mr orme lucy said i dont look so ill as you wrote he was his joy to see you said she but mr orme is in a declining way mr greville on the coach stopping rode back just as it was going on again and with a loud laugh how the dl came orme to know of your coming madam poor fellow it was very kind of you to stop your coach to speak to the statue and he laughed again nonsensical at what my grandmamma shirley dearest of parents her youth as she was pleased to say renewed by the expectation of so soon seeing her darling child came as my aunt told us you know on thursday night to selbyhouse to charge her and lucy with her blessing to me and resolving to stay there to receive me our beloved nancy was also to be there so were two other cousins kitty and patty holles good young creatures who in my absence had attended my grandmamma at every convenient opportunity and whom i also found here when we came within sight of this house now harriet said lucy i see the same kind of emotions beginning to arise in your face and bosom as lady g told us you shewed when you first saw your aunt at dunstable my grandmamma said i i am in sight of the dear house that holds her i hope she is here but i will not surprise her with my joy to see her lie still throbbing impatient heart but when the coach set us down at the inner gate there in the outwardhall sat my blessed grandmamma the moment i beheld her my intended caution forsook me i sprang by my aunt and before the footstep could be put down flew as it were out of the coach and threw myself at her feet wrapping my arms about her bless bless said i your harriet i could not at the moment say another word great god said the pious parent her hands and eyes lifted up great god i thank thee then folding her arms about my neck she kissed my forehead my cheek my lips god bless my love pride of my life the most precious of a hundred daughters how does my child my harriet o my love after such dangers such trials such harassings once more god be praised that i clasp to my fond heart my harriet separate them separate them said my facetious uncle yet he had tears in his eyes before they grow together madam to my grandmamma she is our harriet as well as yours let us welcome the saucy girl on her reentrance into these doors saucy i suppose i shall soon find her my grandmamma withdrew her fond arms take her take her said she each in turn but i think i never can part with her again my uncle saluted me and bid me very kindly welcome home so did every one how can i return the obligations which the love of all my friends lays upon me to be good to be grateful is not enough since that one ought to be for ones own sake yet how can i be even grateful to them with half a heart ah lady g you bid me be free in my confessions you promise to look my letters over before you read them to any body and to mark passages proper to be kept to yourself pray do mr greville and mr fenwick were here separately an hour ago i thanked them for their civility on the road and not ungraciously as mr greville told my uncle as to him he was not he said without hopes yet since i knew not how to be ungrateful mr greville builds as he always did a merit on his civility and by that means sinks in the narrower lover the claim he might otherwise make to the title of the generous neighbour miss orme has just been here she could not help throwing in a word for her brother you will guess my dear lady g at the subject of our conversations here and what they will be morning noon and night for a week to come my grandmamma is better in health than i have known her for a year or two past the health of people in years can mend but slowly and they are slow to acknowledge it in their own favour my grandmamma however allows that she is better within these few days past but attributes the amendment to her harriets return how do they all bless revere extol your noble brother how do they wish and how do they regret you know what yet how ready are they to applaud your harriet if she can hold her magnanimity in preferring the happiness of clementina to her own my grandmamma and aunt are of opinion that i should and they praise me for the generosity of my effort whether the superior merits of the man will or will not allow me to succeed in it but my uncle my lucy and my nancy from their unbounded love of me think a little and but a little narrower and believing it will go hard with me say it is hard my uncle in particular says the very pretension is flight and nonsense but however if the girl added he can parade away her passion for an object so worthy with all my heart it will be but just that the romancing elevations which so often drive headstrong girls into difficulties should now and then help a more discreet one out of them adieu my beloved lady g repeated compliments love thanks to my lord and lady l to my emily to dr bartlett to mr beauchamp and particularly to my lord g dear dear charlotte be good let me beseech you be good if you are not you will have every one of my friends who met you at dunstable and from their report my grandmamma and nancy against you for they find but one fault in my lord it is that he seems too fond of a lady who by her archness of looks and halfsaucy turns upon him even before them evidently shewed shall i say what but i stand up for you my dear your gratitude your generosity your honour i say and why should i not add your duty will certainly make you one of the most obliging of wives to the most affectionate of husbands my uncle says he hopes so but though he adores you for a friend and the companion of a lively hour yet he does not know but his dame selby is still the woman whom a man should prefer for a wife and she said he is full as saucy as a wife need to be though i think harriet that she has not been the less dutiful of late for your absence once more adieu my dear lady g and continue to love your harriet byron letter xxxvii lady g to miss byron thursday april every one of the dunstable party say that you are a grateful and good girl beauchamp can talk of nobody else of our sex i believe in my conscience he is in love with you i think all the unprovidedfor young women wherever you come must hate you was you never by surprise carried into the chamber of a friend labouring with the smallpox in the infectious stage of it o but i think you once said you had had that distemper but your mind harriet were your face to be ruined would make you admirers the fellows who could think of preferring even such a face to such a heart may be turned over to the class of insignificants is not your aunt selby you ask an excellent woman she is i admire her but i am very angry with you for deferring to another time acquainting me with what she said of me when we are taken with any body we love they should be taken with us teasing harriet you know what an immoderate quantity of curiosity i have never serve me so again i am in love with your cousin lucy were either fenwick or greville good enough but they are not i think she shall have mr orme nancy you say is such another good girl i dont doubt it is she not your cousin and lucys sister but i cannot undertake for every good girl who wants a husband i wish i had seen lucy a fortnight ago then nancy might have had mr orme and lucy should have had lord g he admires her greatly and do you think that a man who at that time professed for me so much love and service and all that would have scrupled to oblige me had i as i easily should proved to him that he would have been a much happier man than he could hope to be with somebody else your uncle is a pleasant man but tell him i say that the man would be out of his wits that did not make the preference he does in favour of his dame selby as he calls her tell him also if you please in return for his plain dealing that i say he studies too much for his pleasantries he is continually hunting for occasions to be smart i have heard my father say that this was the fault of some wits of his acquaintance whom he ranked among the witlings for it if you think it will mortify him more you may tell him for i am very revengeful when i think myself affronted that were i at liberty which god help me i am not i would sooner choose for a husband the man i have poor soul as i now and then think him than such a teasing creature as himself were both in my power and both of an age and i should have this good reason for my preference your uncle and i should have been too much alike and so been jealous of each others wit whereas i can make my honest lord g look about him and admire me strangely whenever i please but i am it seems a person of a particular character every one you say loves me yet blames me odd characters my dear are needful to make even characters shine you good girls would not be valued as you are if there were not bad ones have you not heard it said that all human excellence is but comparative pray allow of the contrast you i am sure ought you are an ungrateful creature if whenever you think of my overlivelinesses as you call em you dont drop a courtesy and say you are obliged to me but still the attack made upon you in your dressingroom at colnebrook by my sister and me sticks in your stomach and why so we were willing to shew you that we were not the silly people you must have thought us had we not been able to distinguish light from darkness you who ever were i believe one of the frankesthearted girls in britain and admired for the ease and dignity given you by that frankness were growing awkward nay dishonest your gratitude your gratitude was the dust you wanted to throw into our eyes that we might not see that you were governed by a stronger motive you called us your friends your sisters but treated us not as either and this man and that and tother you could refuse and why no reason given for it and we were to be popt off with your gratitude truly we were to believe just what you said and no more nay not so much as you said but we were not so implicit nor would you in our case have been so but you perhaps would not have violently broken in upon a poor thing who thought we were blind because she was not willing we should see may be not but then in that case we were honester than you would have been thats all here said i lady l is this poor girl awkwardly struggling to conceal what every body sees and seeing applauds her for the man considered yes harriet the man considered be pleased to take that in let us in pity relieve her she is thought to be frank openhearted communicative nay she passes herself upon us in those characters she sees we keep nothing from her she has been acquainted with your love before wedlock with my folly in relation to anderson she has carried her head above a score or two of men not contemptible she sits enthroned among us while we make but common figures at her footstool she calls us sisters friends and twenty pretty names let us acquaint her that we see into her heart and why lord d and others are so indifferent with her if she is ingenuous let us spare her if not leave me to punish her yet we will keep up her punctilio as to our brother we will leave him to make his own discoveries she may confide in his politeness and the result will be happier for her because she will then be under no restraint to us and her native freedom of heart may again take its course agreed agreed said lady l and arminarm we entered your dressingroom dismissed the maid and began the attack and o harriet how you hesitated paraded fooled on with us before you came to confession indeed you deserved not the mercy we shewed you so child you had better to have let this part of your story sleep in peace you bid me not tell emily that your cousin is in love with her but i think i will girls begin very early to look out for admirers it is better in order to stay her stomach to find out one for her than that she should find out one for herself especially when the man is among ourselves as i may say and both are in our own management and at distance from each other emily is a good girl but she has susceptibilities already and though i would not encourage her as yet to look out of herself for happiness yet i would give her consequence with herself and at the same time let her see that there could be no mention made of any thing that related to her but what she should be acquainted with dear girl i love her as well as you and i pity her too for she as well as somebody else will have difficulties to contend with which she will not know easily how to get over though she can in a flame so young generously prefer the interest of a more excellent woman to her own there harriet is a grave paragraph youll like me for it you are a very reflecting girl in mentioning to me so particularly your behaviour to your grevilles fenwicks and ormes what is that but saying see charlotte i am a much more complacent creature to the men no one of which i intend to have than you are to your husband what a pious woman indeed must be your grandmamma that she could suspend her joy her longabsent darling at her feet till she had first thanked god for restoring her to her arms but in this instance we see the force of habitual piety though not so good as i should be myself i revere those who are so and that i hope you will own is no bad sign well but now for ourselves and those about us lady olivia has written a letter from windsor to lady l it is in french extremely polite she promises to write to me from oxford lady anne s made me a visit this morning she was more concerned than i wished to see her on my confirming the report she had heard of my brothers being gone abroad i rallied her a little too freely as it was before lord g and lord l i never was better rebuked than by her for she took out her pencil and on the cover of a letter wrote these lines from shakespeare and slid them into my hand and will you rend our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend it is not friendly tis not maidenly our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury i never my dear told you how freely this lady and i had talked of love but freely as we had talked i was not aware that the matter lay so deep in her heart i knew not how to tell her that my brother had said it could not be i could have wept over her when i read this paper and i owned myself by a whisper justly rebuked she charged me not to let any man see this particularly not either of those present and do you harriet keep what i have written of lady anne to yourself my aunt eleanor has written a congratulatory letter to me from york sir charles it seems had acquainted her with lord gs day not my day harriet that is not the phrase i hope as soon as he knew it himself and she writes supposing that i was actually offered on it women are victims on these occasions i hope youll allow me that my brother has made it a point of duty to acquaint his fathers sister with every matter of consequence to the family and now she says that both her nieces are so well disposed of she will come to town very quickly to see her new relations and us and desires we will make room for her and yet she owns that my brother has informed her of his being obliged to go abroad and she supposes him gone as he is the beloved of her heart i wonder she thinks of making this visit now he is absent but we shall all be glad to see my aunt nell she is a good creature though an old maid i hope the old lady has not utterly lost either her invention or memory and then between both i shall be entertained with a great number of lovestories of the last age and perhaps of some dangers and escapes which may serve for warnings for emily alas alas they will come too late for your charlotte i have written already the longest letter that i ever wrote in my life yet it is prating and to you to whom i love to prate i have not near done you bid me be good and you threaten me if i am not with the ill opinion of all your friends but i have such an unaccountable bias for roguery or what shall i call it that i believe it is impossible for me to take your advice i have been examining myself what a deuse is the matter with me that i cannot see my honest man in the same advantageous light in which he appears to everybody else yet i do not in my heart dislike him on the contrary i know not were i to look about me far and wide the man i would have wished to have called mine rather than him but he is so important about trifles so nimble yet so slow he is so sensible of his own intention to please and has so many antic motions in his obligingness that i cannot forbear laughing at the very time that i ought perhaps to reward him with a gracious approbation i must fool on a little while longer i believe permit me harriet so to do as occasions arise an instance an instance in point harriet let me laugh as i write i did at the time what do you laugh at charlotte why this poor man or as i should rather say this lord and master of mine has just left me he has been making me both a compliment and a present and what do you think the compliment is why if i please he will give away to a virtuoso friend his collection of moths and butterflies i once he remembered rallied him upon them and by what study thought i wilt thou honest man supply their place if thou hast a talent this way pursue it since perhaps thou wilt not shine in any other and the best any thing you know harriet carries with it the appearance of excellence nay he would also part with his collection of shells if i had no objection to whom my lord he had not resolved why then only as emily is too little of a child or you might give them to her too little of a child madam and a great deal of bustle and importance took possession of his features let me tell you madam i wont let you my lord and i laughed well madam i hope here is something coming up that you will not disdain to accept of yourself up came groaning under the weight or rather under the care two servants with baskets a fine set of old japan china with brown edges believe me they sat down their baskets and withdrew would you not have been delighted harriet to see my lord busying himself with taking out and putting in the windows one at a time the cups plates jars and saucers rejoicing and parading over them and shewing his connoisseurship to his motionless admiring wife in commending this and the other piece as a beauty and when he had done taking the liberty as he phrased it half fearful half resolute to salute his bride for his reward and then pacing backwards several steps with such a strut and a crow i see him yet indulge me harriet i burst into a hearty laugh i could not help it and he reddening looked round himself and round himself to see if anything was amiss in his garb the man the man honest friend i could have said but had too much reverence for my husband is the oddity nothing amiss in the garb i quickly recollected myself however and put him in a good humour by proper marks of my gracious acceptance on reflection i could not bear myself for vexing the honest man when he had meant to oblige me how soon i may relapse again i know not o harriet why did you beseech me to be good i think in my heart i have the stronger inclination to be bad for it you call me perverse if you think me so bid me be saucy bid me be bad and i may then like other good wives take the contrary course for the sake of dear contradiction shew not however i in turn beseech you to your grandmamma and aunt such parts of this letter as would make them despise me you say you stand up for me i have need of your advocateship never let me want it and do i not after all do a greater credit to my good man when i can so heartily laugh in the wedded state than if i were to sit down with my finger in my eye i have taken your advice and presented my sister with my half of the jewels i desired her to accept them as they were my mothers and for her sake this gave them a value with her more than equal with their worth but lord l is uneasy and declares he will not suffer lady l long to lie under the obligation were every one of family in south britain and north britain to be as generous and disinterested as lord l and our family the union of the two parts of the island would be complete lord help this poor obliging man i wish i dont love him at last he has taken my hint and has presented his collection of shells a very fine one he says it is to emily and they two are actually busied and will be for an hour or two i doubt not in admiring them the one strutting over the beauties in order to enhance the value of the present the other courtesying ten times in a minute to shew her gratitude poor man when his virtuoso friend has got his butterflies and moths i am afraid he must set up a turners shop for employment if he loved reading i could when our visiting hurries are over set him to read to me the new things that come out while i knot or work and if he loved writing to copy the letters which pass between you and me and those for you which i expect with so much impatience from my brother by means of dr bartlett i think he spells pretty well for a lord i have no more to say at present but compliments without number or measure to all you so deservedly love and honour as well those i have not seen as those i have only one thing reveal to me all the secrets of your heart and how that heart is from time to time affected that i may know whether you are capable of that greatness of mind in a lovecase that you shew in all others we will all allow you to love sir charles grandison those who do give honour to themselves if their eyes stop not at person his having so many advantages for the same reason i make no apologies and never did for praising my brother as any other lover of him might do let me know every thing how and about your fellows too ah harriet you make not the use of power that i would have done in your situation i was halfsorry when my hurrying brother made me dismiss sir walter and yet to have but two danglers after one are poor doings for a fine lady poorer still to have but one heres a letter as long as my arm adieu i was loath to come to the name but defer it ever so long i must subscribe at last charlotte g letter xxxviii miss jervois to miss byron monday may the letter to which this is an answer as well as those written by miss byron to her cousin reeves lady l c and theirs in return are omitted o my dearest my honoured miss byron how you have shamed your emily by sending a letter to her such a sweet letter too before i have paid my duty to you in a letter of thanks for all your love to me and for all your kind instructions but i began once twice and thrice and wrote a great deal each time but could not please myself you madam are such a writer and i am such a poor thing at my pen but i know you will accept the heart and so my very diffidence shews pride since it cannot be expected from me to be a fine writer and yet this very letter i foresee will be the worse for my diffidence and not the better for i dont like this beginning neither but come it shall go am i not used to your goodness and do you not bid me prattle to you in my letters as i used to do in your dressingroom o what sweet advice have you and do you return for my silly prate and so i will begin and was you grieved at parting with your emily on saturday morning i am sure i was very much concerned at parting with you i could not help crying all the way to town and lady g shed tears as well as i and so did lady l several times and said you were the loveliest best young lady in the world and we all praised likewise your aunt your cousin lucy and young mr selby how good are all your relations they must be good and lord l and lord g for men were as much concerned as we at parting with you mr reeves was so dull all the way poor mr reeves he was very dull and mr beauchamp he praised you to the very skies and in such a pretty manner too next to my guardian i think mr beauchamp is a very agreeable man i fancy these noble sisters if the truth were known dont like him so well as their brother does perhaps that may be the reason out of jealousy as i may say if there be any thing in my observation but they are vastly civil to him nevertheless yet they never praise him when his back is turned as they do others who cant say half the good things that he says well but enough of mr beauchamp my guardian my gracious my kind my indulgent guardian who that thinks of him can praise any body else o madam where is he now god protect and guide my guardian wherever he goes this is my prayer first and last and i cant tell how often in the day i look for him in every place i have seen him in and pray tell me madam did not you do so when he had left us and when i cant find him i do so sigh what a pleasure yet what a pain is there in sighing when i think of him yet i know i am an innocent girl and this i am sure of that i wish him to be the husband of but one woman in the whole world and that is you but then my next wish is you know what ah my miss byron you must let me live with you and my guardian if you should ever be lady grandison but here madam are sad doings sometimes between lord and lady g i am very angry at her often in my heart yet i cannot help laughing now and then at her outoftheway sayings is not her character a very new one or are there more such young wives i could not do as she does were i to be queen of the globe every body blames her she will make my lord not love her at last dont you think so and then what will she get by her wit just this moment she came into my closet writing emily said she to whom i told her dont tell tales out of school emily i was so afraid that she would have asked to see what i had written but she did not to be sure she is very polite and knows what belongs to herself and every body else to be ungenerous as you once said to her husband only that is a very sad thing to think of well and i would give any thing to know if you think what i have written tolerable before i go any farther but i will go on in this way since i cannot do better bad is my best but you shall have quantity i warrant since you bid me write long letters but i have seen my mother it was but yesterday she was in a mercers shop in covent garden i was in lord ls chariot only anne was with me anne saw her first i alighted and asked her blessing in the shop i am sure i did right she blessed me and called me dear love i stayed till she had bought what she wanted and then i slid down the money as if it were her own doing and glad i was i had so much about me it came but to four guineas i begged her speaking low to forgive me for so doing and finding she was to go home as far as soho and had thoughts of having a hackney coach called i gave anne money for a coach for herself and waited on my mother to her own lodgings and it being lord ls chariot she was so good as to dispense with my alighting she blessed my guardian all the way and blessed me she said she would not ask me to come to see her because it might not be thought proper as my guardian was abroad but she hoped she might be allowed to come and see me sometimes was she not very good madam but my guardians goodness makes every body good o that my mamma had been always the same i should have been but too happy god bless my guardian for putting me on enlarging her power to live handsomely only as a coach brings on other charges and people must live accordingly or be discredited instead of credited by it or i should hope the additional two hundred ayear might afford them one yet one does not know but mr ohara may have been in debt before he married her and i fancy he has people who hang upon him but if it pleases god i will not when i am at age and have a coach of my own suffer my mother to walk on foot what a blessing is it to have a guardian that will second every good purpose of ones heart lady olivia is rambling about and i suppose she will wait here in england till sir charless return but i am sure he never will have her a wicked wretch with her poniards yet it is pity she is a fine woman but i hate her for her expectation as well as for her poniard and a woman to leave her own country to seek for a husband i could die before i could do so though to such a man as my guardian yet once i thought i could have liked to have lived with her at florence she has some good qualities and is very generous and in the main well esteemed in her own country every body knew she loved my guardian but i dont know how it is nobody blamed her for it vast as the difference in fortune then was but that is the glory of being a virtuous man to love him is a credit instead of a shame o madam who would not be virtuous and that not only for their own but for their friends sakes if they loved their friends and wished them to be well thought of lord w is very desirous to hasten his wedding mr beauchamp says that all the mansfields he knows them bless my guardian every day of their lives and their enemies tremble he has commissions from my guardian to inquire and act in their cause that no time may be lost to do them service against his return we have had another visit from lady beauchamp and have returned it she is very much pleased with us you see i say us indeed my two dear ladies are very good to me but i have no merit it is all for their brothers sake mr beauchamp tells us just now that his motherinlaw has joined with his father at her own motion to settle a year upon him i am glad of it with all my heart are not you he is all gratitude upon it he says that he will redouble his endeavours to oblige her and that his gratitude to her as well as his duty to his father will engage his utmost regard for her mr beauchamp sir harry himself and my lady are continually blessing my guardian every body in short blesses him but ah madam where is he at this moment o that i were a bird that i might hover over his head and sometimes bring tidings to his friends of his motions and good deeds i would often flap my wings dear miss byron at your chamber window as a signal of his welfare and then fly back again and perch as near him as i could i am very happy as i said before in the favour of lady and lord l and lady and lord g but i never shall be so happy as when i had the addition of your charming company i miss you and my guardian o how i miss you both but dearest miss byron love me not the less though now i have put pen to paper and you see what a poor creature i am in my writing many a one i believe may be thought tolerable in conversation but when they are so silly as to put pen to paper they expose themselves as i have done in this long piece of scribble but accept it nevertheless for the true love i bear you and a truer love never flamed in any bosom to any one the most dearly beloved than does in mine for you i am afraid i have written arrant nonsense because i knew not how to express half the love that is in the heart of your everobliged and affectionate emily jervois letter xxxix miss byron to lady g tuesday may i have no patience with you lady g you are ungenerously playful thank heaven if this be wit that i have none of it but what signifies expostulating with one who knows herself to be faulty and will not amend how many stripes charlotte do you deserve but you never spared any body not even your brother when the humour was upon you so make haste and since you will lay in stores for repentance fill up your measure as fast as you can reveal to you the state of my heart ah my dear it is an unmanageable one greatness of mind i dont know what it is all his excellencies his greatness his goodness his modesty his cheerfulness under such afflictions as would weigh down every other heart that had but half the compassion in it with which his overflows must not all other men appear little and less than little nothing in my eyes it is an instance of patience in me that i can endure any of them who pretend to regard me out of my own family i thought that when i got down to my dear friends here i should be better enabled by their prudent counsels to attain the desirable frame of mind which i had promised myself but i find myself mistaken my grandmamma and aunt are such admirers of him take such a share in the disappointment that their advice has not the effect i had hoped it would have lucy nancy are perpetually calling upon me to tell them something of sir charles grandison and when i begin i know not how to leave off my uncle rallies me laughs at me sometimes reminds me of what he calls my former brags i did not brag my dear i only hoped that respecting as i did every man according to his merit i should never be greatly taken with any one before duty added force to the inclination methinks the company of the friends i am with does not satisfy me yet they never were dearer to me than they now are i want to have lord and lady l lord and lady g dr bartlett my emily with me to lose you all at once is hard there seems to be a strange void in my heart and so much at present for the state of that heart i always had reason to think myself greatly obliged to my friends and neighbours all around us but never till my return after these few months absence knew how much so many kind visitors such unaffected expressions of joy on my return that had i not a very great counterbalance on my heart would be enough to make me proud my grandmamma went to shirleymanor on saturday on monday i was with her all day but she would have it that i should be melancholy if i staid with her and she is so selfdenyingly careful of her harriet there never was a more noble heart in woman but her solitary moments as my uncle calls them are her moments of joy and why because she then divests herself of all that is either painful or pleasurable to her in this life for she says that her cares for her harriet and especially now are at least a balance for the delight she takes in her you command me to acquaint you with what passes between me and the gentlemen in my neighbourhood in your style my fellows mr fenwick invited himself to breakfast with my aunt selby yesterday morning i would not avoid him i will not trouble you with the particulars you know well enough what men will say on the subject upon which you will suppose he wanted to talk to me he was extremely earnest i besought him to accept my thanks for his good opinion of me as all the return i could make him for it and this in so very serious a manner that my heart was fretted when he declared with warmth his determined perseverance mr greville made us a teavisit in the afternoon my uncle and he joined to rally us poor women as usual i left the defence of the sex to my aunt and lucy how poor appears to me every conversation now with these men but hold saucy harriet was not your uncle selby one of the raillers but he does not believe all he says and therefore cannot wish to be so much regarded on this topic as he ought to be by me on others after the run of raillery was over in which mr greville made exceptions favourable to the women present he applied to every one for their interest with me and to me to countenance his address he set forth his pretensions very pompously and mentioned a very considerable increase of his fortune which before was a very handsome one he offered our own terms he declared his love for me above all women and made his happiness in the next world as well as in this depend upon my favour to him it was easy to answer all he said and is equally so for you to guess in what manner i answered him and he finding me determined began to grow vehement and even affrontive he hinted to me that he knew what had made me so very resolute he threw out threatenings against the man be he whom he would that should stand in the way of his success with me at the same time intimating saucily as i may say for his manner had insult in it that it was impossible a certain event could ever take place my uncle was angry with him so was my aunt lucy was still more angry than they but i standing up said pray my dear friends take nothing amiss that mr greville has said he once told me that he would set spies upon my conduct in town if sir your spies have been just i fear nothing they can say but the hints you have thrown out shew such a total want of all delicacy of mind that you must not wonder if my heart rejects you yet i am not angry i reproach you not every one has his peculiar way all that is left me to say or to do is to thank you for your favourable opinion of me as i have thanked mr fenwick and to desire that you will allow me to look upon you as my neighbour and only as my neighbour i courtesied to him and withdrew but my great difficulty had been before with mr orme his sister had desired that i would see her brother he and she were invited by my aunt to dinner on tuesday they came poor man he is not well i am sorry for it poor mr orme is not well he made me such honest compliments as i may say his heart was too much in his civilities to raise them above the civilities that justice and truth might warrant in favour of a person highly esteemed mine was filled with compassion for him and that compassion would have shewn itself in tokens of tenderness more than once had i not restrained myself for his sake how you my dear lady g can delight in giving pain to an honest heart i cannot imagine i would make all god almightys creatures happy if i could and so would your noble brother is he not crossing dangerous seas and ascending through almost perpetual snows those dreadful alps which i have heard described with such terror for the generous end of relieving distress i made mr orme sit next me i was assiduous to help him and to do him all the little offices which i thought would light up pleasure in his modest countenance and he was quite another man it gave delight to his sister and to all my friends to see him smile and look happy i think my dear lady g that when mr orme looks pleasant and at ease he resembles a little the goodnatured lord g o that you would take half the pains to oblige him that i do to relieve mr orme half the pains did i say that you would not take pains to disoblige him and he would be of course obliged dont be afraid my dear that in such a world as this things will not happen to make you uneasy without your studying for them excuse my seriousness i am indeed too serious at times but when mr orme requested a few minutes audience of me as he called it and i walked with him into the cedar parlour which you have heard me mention and with which i hope you will be one day acquainted he paid poor man for his too transient pleasure why would he urge a denial that he could not but know i must give his sister and i had afterwards a conference she pleaded too strongly her brothers health and even his life both which she would have it depended on my favour to him i was greatly affected and at last besought her if she valued my friendship as i did hers never more to mention to me a subject which gave me a pain too sensible for my peace she requested me to assure her that neither mr greville nor mr fenwick might be the man they both took upon them she said to ridicule her brother for the profound respect even to reverence that he bore me which if he knew might be attended with consequences for that her brother mild and gentle as was his passion for me had courage to resent any indignities that might be cast upon him by spirits boisterous as were those of the two gentlemen she had named she never therefore told her brother of their scoffs but it would go to her heart if either of them should succeed or have reason but for a distant hope i made her heart easy on that score i have just now heard that sir hargrave pollexfen is come from abroad already what can be the meaning of it he is so lowminded so malicious a man and i have suffered so much from him what can be the meaning of his sudden return i am told that he is actually in london pray my dear lady g inform yourself about him and whether he thinks of coming into these parts mr greville when he met us at stoneystratford threw out menaces against sir hargrave on my account and said it was well he was gone abroad i told him then that he had no business even were sir hargrave present to engage himself in my quarrels mr greville is an impetuous man a man of rough manners and makes many people afraid of him he has i believe indeed had his spies about me for he seems to know every thing that has befallen me in my absence from selby house he has dared also to threaten somebody else insolent wretch but he hinted to me yesterday that he was exceedingly pleased with the news that a certain gentleman was gone abroad in order to prosecute a former amour was the light wretchs as light expression if my indignant eyes could have killed him he would have fallen dead at my feet let the constant and true respects of all my friends to you and yours and to my beloved emily be always for the future considered as very affectionately expressed whether the variety of other subjects leaves room for a particular expression of them or not by my dearest lady g your faithful and everobliged harriet byron letter xl lady g to miss byron saturday may i thank you harriet for yours what must your fellows think of you in this gross age your delicacy must astonish them there used to be more of it formerly but how should men know any thing of it when women have forgot it lord be thanked we females since we have been admitted into so constant a share of the public diversions want not courage we can give the men stare for stare wherever we meet them the next age nay the rising generation must surely be all heroes and heroines but whither has this word delicacy carried me me who it seems have faults to be corrected for of another sort and who want not the courage for which i congratulate others but to other subjects i could write a vast deal of stuff about my lord and self and lord and lady l who assume parts which i know not how to allow them and sometimes they threaten me with my brothers resentments sometimes with my harriets so that i must really have leadingstrings fastened to my shoulders o my dear a fond husband is a surfeiting thing and yet i believe most women love to be made monkeys of but all other subjects must now give way we have heard of though not from my brother a particular friend of mr lowther was here with a letter from that gentleman acquainting us that sir charles and he were arrived at paris mr beauchamp was with us when mr lowthers friend came he borrowed the letter on account of the extraordinary adventure mentioned in it make your heart easy in the first place about sir hargrave he is indeed in town but very ill he was frightened into england and intends not ever again to quit it in all probability he owes it to my brother that he exists mr beauchamp went directly to cavendishsquare and informed himself there of other particulars relating to the affair from the very servant who was present and acting in it and from those particulars and mr lowthers letter wrote one for dr bartlett mr beauchamp obliged me with the perusal of what he wrote whence i have extracted the following account for his letter is long and circumstantial and i did not ask his leave to take a copy as he seemed desirous to hasten it to the doctor on wednesday the of april in the evening as my brother was pursuing his journey to paris and was within two miles of that capital a servantman rode up in visible terror to his postchaise in which were mr lowther and himself and besought them to hear his dreadful tale the gentlemen stopt and he told them that his master who was an englishman and his friend of the same nation had been but a little while before attacked and forced out of the road in their postchaise as he doubted not to be murdered by no less than seven armed horsemen and he pointed to a hill at distance called mont matre behind which they were at that moment perpetrating their bloody purpose he had just before he said addressed himself to two other gentlemen and their retinue who drove on the faster for it the servants great coat was open and sir charles observing his livery asked him if he were not a servant of sir hargrave pollexfen and was answered in the affirmative there are it seems trees planted on each side the road from st denis to paris but which as france is an open and uninclosed country would not but for the hill have hindered the seeing a great way off the scuffling of so many men on horseback there is also a ditch on either hand but places left for owners to come at their grounds with their carts and other carriages sir charles ordered the post boy to drive to one of those passages saying he could not forgive himself if he did not endeavour to save sir hargrave and his friend whose name the man told him was merceda his own servants were three in number besides one of mr lowther my brother made mr lowthers servant dismount and getting himself on his horse ordered the others to follow him he begged mr lowther to continue in the chaise bidding the dismounted servant stay and attend his master and galloped away towards the hill his ears were soon pierced with the cries of the poor wretches and presently he saw two men on horseback holding the horses of four others who had under them the two gentlemen struggling groaning and crying out for mercy sir charles who was a good way ahead of his servants calling out to spare the gentlemen and bending his course to relieve the prostrate sufferers two of the four quitted their prey and mounting joined the other two horsemen and advanced to meet him with a shew of supporting the two men on foot in their violence who continued laying on the wretches with the butends of their whips unmercifully as the assailants offered not to fly and as they had more than time enough to execute their purpose had it been robbery and murder sir charles concluded it was likely that these men were actuated by a private revenge he was confirmed in this surmise when the four men on horseback though each had his pistol ready drawn as sir charles also had his demanded a conference warning sir charles how he provoked his fate by his rashness and declaring that he was a dead man if he fired forbear then said sir charles all further violences to the gentlemen and i will hear what you have to say he then put his pistol into his holster and one of his servants being come up and the two others at hand to whom he called out not to fire till they had his orders he gave him his horses reins bidding him have an eye on the holsters of both and leapt down and drawing his sword made towards the two men who were so cruelly exercising their whips and who on his approach retired to some little distance drawing their hangers the four men on horseback joined the two on foot just as they were quitting the objects of their fury and one of them said forbear for the present further violence brother the gentleman shall be told the cause of all this murder sir said he is not intended nor are we robbers the men whom you are solicitous to save from our vengeance are villains be the cause what it will answered sir charles you are in a country noted for doing speedy justice upon proper application to the magistrates in the same instant he raised first one groaning man then the other their heads were all over bloody and they were so much bruised that they could not extend their arms to reach their wigs and hats which lay near them nor put them on without sir charless help the men on foot by this time had mounted their horses and all six stood upon their defence but one of them was so furious crying out that his vengeance should be yet more complete that two of the others could hardly restrain him sir charles asked sir hargrave and mr merceda whether they had reason to look upon themselves as injured men or injurers one of the assailants answered that they both knew themselves to be villains either from consciousness or terror perhaps from both they could not speak for themselves but by groans nor could either of them stand or sit upright just then came up in the chaise mr lowther and his servant each a pistol in his hand he quitted the chaise when he came near the suffering men and sir charles desired him instantly to examine whether the gentlemen were dangerously hurt or not the most enraged of the assailants having slipt by the two who were earnest to restrain him would again have attacked mr merceda offering a stroke at him with his hanger but sir charles his drawn sword still in his hand caught hold of his bridle and turning his horses head aside diverted a stroke which in all probability would otherwise have been a finishing one they all came about sir charles bidding him at his peril use his sword upon their friend and sir charless servants were coming up to their masters support had there been occasion at that instant mr lowther assisted by his own servant was examining the wounds and bruises of the two terrified men who had yet no reason to think themselves safe from further violence sir charles repeatedly commanded his servants not to fire nor approach nearer without his orders the persons said he to the assailants whom you have so cruelly used are englishmen of condition i will protect them be the provocation what it will you must know that your attempt upon them is a criminal one and if my friend last come up who is a very skilful surgeon shall pronounce them in danger you shall find it so still he held the horse of the furious one and three of them who seemed to be principals were beginning to express some resentment at his cavalier treatment when mr lowther gave his opinion that there was no apparent danger of death and then sir charles quitting the mans bridle and putting himself between the assailants and sufferers said that as they had not either offered to fly or to be guilty of violence to himself his friend or servants he was afraid they had some reason to think themselves ill used by the gentlemen but however as they could not suppose they were at liberty in a civilized country to take their revenge on the persons of those who were entitled to the protection of that country he should expect that they would hold themselves to be personally answerable for their conduct at a proper tribunal the villains one of the men said knew who they were and what the provocation was which had merited a worse treatment than they had hitherto met with you sir proceeded he seem to be a man of honour and temper we are men of honour as well as you our design as we told you was not to kill the miscreants but to give them reason to remember their villainy as long as they lived and to put it out of their power ever to be guilty of the like they have made a vile attempt continued he on a ladys honour at abbeville and finding themselves detected and in danger took roundabout ways and shifted from one vehicle to another to escape the vengeance of her friends the gentleman whose horse you held and who has reason to be in a passion is the husband of the lady a spanish husband surely harriet not a french one according to our notions that gentleman and that are her brothers we have been in pursuit of them two days for they gave out in order no doubt to put us on a wrong scent that they were to go to antwerp and it seems my dear that sir hargrave and his colleague had actually sent some of their servants that way which was the reason that they were themselves attended but by one the gentleman told sir charles that there was a third villain in their plot they had hopes he said that he would not escape the close pursuit of a manufacturer at abbeville whose daughter a lovely young creature he had seduced under promises of marriage their government he observed were great countenancers of the manufacturers at abbeville and he would have reason if he were laid hold of to think himself happy if he came off with being obliged to perform his promises this third wretch must be mr bagenhall the lord grant say i that he may be laid hold of and obliged to make a ruined girl an honest woman as they phrase it in lancashire dont you wish so my dear and let me add that had the relations of the injured lady completed their intended vengeance on those two libertines a very proper punishment i ween for all libertines it might have helped them to pass the rest of their lives with great tranquillity and honest girls might for any contrivances of theirs have passed to and from masquerades without molestation sir hargrave and his companion intended it seems at first to make some resistance four only of the seven stopping the chaise but when the other three came up and they saw who they were and knew their own guilt their courage failed them the seventh man was set over the postboy whom he had led about half a mile from the spot they had chosen as a convenient one for their purpose sir hargraves servant was secured by them at their first attack but after they had disarmed him and his masters he found an opportunity to slip from them and made the best of his way to the road in hopes of procuring assistance for them while sir charles was busy in helping the bruised wretches on their feet the seventh man came up to the others followed by sir hargraves chaise the assailants had retired to some distance and after a consultation together they all advanced towards sir charles who bidding his servants be on their guard leapt on his horse with that agility and presence of mind for which mr beauchamp says he excels most men and leading towards them do you advance gentlemen said he as friends or otherwise mr lowther took a pistol in each hand and held himself ready to support him and the servants disposed themselves to obey their masters orders our enmity answered one of them is only to these two inhospitable villains murder as we told you was not our design they know where we are to be found and that they are the vilest of men and have not been punished equal to their demerits let them on their knees ask this gentlemans pardon pointing to the husband of the insulted lady we insist upon this satisfaction and upon their promise that they never more will come within two leagues of abbeville and we will leave them to your protection i fancy harriet that these womenfrightening heroes needed not to have been urged to make this promise sir charles turning towards them said if you have done wrong gentlemen you ought not to scruple asking pardon if you know yourselves to be innocent though i should be loath to risk the lives of my friend and servants yet shall not my countrymen make so undue a submission the wretches kneeled and the seven men civilly saluting sir charles and mr lowther rode off to the joy of the two delinquents who kneeled again to their deliverer and poured forth blessings upon the man whose life so lately one of them sought and whose preservation he had now so much reason to rejoice in for the sake of his own safety my brother himself could not but be well pleased that he was not obliged to come to extremities which might have ended fatally on both sides by this time sir hargraves postchaise was come up he and his colleague were with difficulty lifted into it my brother and mr lowther went into theirs and being but a small distance from paris they proceeded thither in company the poor wretches blessing them all the way and at paris found their other servants waiting for them sir charles and mr lowther saw them in bed in the lodgings that had been taken for them they were so stiff with the bastinado they had met with that they were unable to help themselves mr merceda had been more severely i cannot call it more cruelly treated than the other for he it seems was the greatest malefactor in the attempt made upon the lady and he had besides two or three gashes which but for his struggles would have been but one as you my dear always turn pale when the word masquerade is mentioned so i warrant will abbeville be a word of terror to these wretches as long as they live their enemies it seems carried off their arms perhaps in the true spirit of french chivalry with a view to lay them as so many trophies at the feet of the insulted lady mr lowther writes that my brother and he are lodged in the hotel of a man of quality a dear friend of the late mr danby and one of the three whom he has remembered in his will and that sir charles is extremely busy in relation to the executorship and having not a moment to spare desired mr lowther to engage his friend to whom he wrote to let us know as much and that he was hastening every thing for his journey onwards mr beauchamps narrative of this affair is as i told you very circumstantial i thought to have shortened it more than i have done i wish i have not made my abstract confused in several material places but i have not time to clear it up adieu my dear charlotte g letter xli lady g to miss byron sunday may i believe i shall become as arrant a scribbler as somebody else i begin to like writing a great compliment to you i assure you i see one may bring ones mind to any thing i thought i must have had recourse when you and my brother left us and when i was married to the public amusements to fill up my leisure and as i have seen every thing worth seeing of those many times over masquerades excepted and them i despise time you know in that case would have passed a little heavily after having shewn myself and by seeing who and who were together laid in a little store of the right sort of conversation for the teatable for you know harriet that among us modern fine people the company and not the entertainment is the principal part of the rareeshow pretty enough to make the entertainment and pay for it too to the honest fellows who have nothing to do but to project schemes to get us together i dont know what to do with this man i little thought that i was to be considered as such a doll such a toy as he would make me i want to drive him out of the house without me were it but to purvey for me news and scandal what are your fine gentlemen fit for else you know that with all my faults i have a domestic and managing turn a man should encourage that in a wife and not be perpetually teasing her for her company abroad unless he did it with a view to keep her at home our sex dont love to be prescribed to even in the things from which they are not naturally averse and for this very reason perhaps because it becomes us to submit to prescription human nature harriet is a perverse thing i believe if my good man wished me to stay at home i should torture my brain as other good wives do for inventions to go abroad it was but yesterday that in order to give him a hint i pinned my apron to his coat without considering who was likely to be a sufferer by it and he getting up in his usual nimble way gave it a rent and then looked behind him with so much apprehension hands folded eyes goggling bag in motion from shoulder to shoulder i was vexed too much to make the use of the trick which i had designed and huffed him he made excuses and looked pitifully bringing in his soul to testify that he knew not how it could be how it could be wretch when you are always squatting upon ones clothes in defiance of hoop or distance he went out directly and brought me in two aprons either of which was worth twenty of that he so carelessly rent who could be angry with him i was indeed thinking to chide him for this as if i were not to be trusted to buy my own clothes but he looked at me with so goodnatured an eye that i relented and accepted with a bow of graciousness his present only calling him an odd creature and that he is you know my dear we live very whimsically in the main not above four quarrels however and as many more chidings in a day what does the man stay at home for then so much when i am at home married people by frequent absences may have a chance for a little happiness how many debatings if not direct quarrels are saved by the good mans and his meek wifes seeing each other but once or twice a week in what can men and women who are much together employ themselves but in proving and defending quarrelling and making up especially if they both chance to marry for love which thank heaven is not altogether my case for then both honest souls having promised more happiness to each other than they can possibly meet with have nothing to do but reproach each other at least tacitly for their disappointment a great deal of freemasonry in love my dear believe me the secret like that when found out is hardly worth the knowing well but what silly rattle is this charlotte methinks you say and put on one of your wisest looks no matter harriet there may be some wisdom in much folly every one speaks not out so plainly as i do but when the novelty of an acquisition or change of condition is over be the change or the acquisition what it will the principal pleasure is over and other novelties are hunted after to keep the pool of life from stagnating this is a serious truth my dear and i expect you to praise me for it you are very sparing of your praise to poor me and yet i had rather have your good word than any womans in the world or mans either i was going to say but i should then have forgot my brother as for lord g were i to accustom him to obligingness i should destroy my own consequence for then it would be no novelty and he would be hunting after a new folly very true harriet well but we have had a good serious fallingout and it still subsists it began on friday night present lord and lady l and emily i was very angry with him for bringing it on before them the man has no discretion my dear none at all and what about why we have not made our appearance at court forsooth a very confident thing this same appearance i think a compliment made to fine clothes and jewels at the expense of modesty lord g pleads decorum decorum against modesty my dear but if by decorum is meant fashion i have in a hundred instances found decorum beat modesty out of the house and as my brother who would have been our principal honour on such an occasion is gone abroad and as ours is an elderly novelty as i may say our fineries were not ready you know before my brother went i was fervent against it i was the only woman of condition in england who would be against it i told my lord that was a reflection on my sex but lord and lady l who had been spoken to i believe by lady gertrude were both on his side i shall have this man utterly ruined for a husband among you when there were three to one it would have looked cowardly to yield you know i was brave but it being proposed for sunday and that being at a little distance it was not doubted but i would comply so the night passed off with prayings hopings and a little mutteration allow me that word or find me a better the entreaty was renewed in the morning but no i was ashamed of him he said i asked him if he really thought so he should think so if i refused him heaven forbid my lord that i who contend for the liberty of acting should hinder you from the liberty of thinking only one piece of advice honest friend said i dont imagine the worst against yourself and another if you have a mind to carry a point with me dont bring on the cause before any body else for that would be to doubt either my duty or your own reasonableness as sure as you are alive harriet the man made an exception against being called honest friend as if as i told him either of the words were incompatible with quality so once he was as froppish as a child on my calling him the man a higher distinction i think than if i had called him a king or a prince the man strange creature to except to a distinction that implies that he is the man of men you see what a captious mortal i have been forced to call my lord but lord and master do not always go together though they do too often for the happiness of many a meek soul of our sex well this debate seemed suspended by my telling him that if i were presented at court i would not have either the earl or lady gertrude go with us the very people who were most desirous to be there but i might not think of that at the time you know i would not be thought very perverse only a little whimsical or so and i wanted not an excellent reason for excluding them are their consents to our past affair doubted my lord said i that you think it necessary for them to appear to justify us he could say nothing to this you know and i should never forgive the husband as i told him on another occasion who would pretend to argue when he had nothing to say then for the baby will be always craving something he wanted me to go abroad with him i forget whither but to some place that he supposed poor man i should like to visit i told him i dared to say he wished to be thought a modern husband and a fashionable man and he would get a bad name if he could never stir out without his wife neither could he answer that you know well we went on mutter mutter grumble grumble the thunder rolling at a distance a little impatience now and then however portending that it would come nearer but as yet it was only pray my dear oblige me and pray my lord excuse me till this morning when he had the assurance to be pretty peremptory hinting that the lord in waiting had been spoken to a fine time of it would a wife have if she were not at liberty to dress herself as she pleases were i to choose again i do assure you my dear it should not be a man who by his taste for moths and butterflies shells china and suchlike trifles would give me warning that he would presume to dress his baby and when he had done would perhaps admire his own fancy more than her person i believe my harriet i shall make you afraid of matrimony but i will pursue my subject for all that when the insolent saw that i did not dress as he would have had me he drew out his face glouting to half the length of my arm but was silent soon after lady l sending to know whether her lord and she were to attend us to the drawingroom and i returning for answer that i should be glad of their company at dinner he was in violent wrath true as you are alive and dressing himself in a great hurry left the house without saying by your leave with your leave or whether he would return to dinner or not very pretty doings harriet lord and lady l came to dinner however i thought they were very kind and till they opened their lips was going to thank them for then it was all elder sister and insolent brotherinlaw i do assure you upon my word harriet they took upon them lady l told me i might be the happiest creature in the world if and there was so good as to stop one of the happiest only lady l who can be happier than you but i said she should neither be so nor deserve to be so if good of her again to stop at if we cannot be all of one mind replied i i shall be wiser in time where was poor lord g gone poor lord g is gone to seek his fortune i believe what did i mean i told them the airs he had given himself and that he was gone without leave or notice of return he had served me right absolutely right lord l said i believed so myself lord g was a very good sort of man and ought not to bear with me so much as he had done but it would be kind in them not to tell him what i had owned the earl lifted up one hand the countess both they had not come to dine with me they said after the answer i had returned but as they were afraid something was wrong between us mediators are not to be of one side only i said and as they had been so kindly free in blaming me i hoped they would be as free with him when they saw him and then it was for gods sake charlotte and let me entreat you lady g and let me too beseech you madam said emily with tears stealing down her cheeks you are both very good you are a sweet girl emily i have a tooplayful heart it will give me some pain and some pleasure but if i had not more pleasure than pain from my play i should not be so silly my lord not coming in and the dinner being ready i ordered it to be served wont you wait a little longer for lord g no i hope he is safe and well he is his own master as well as mine i sighed i believe and no doubt has a paramount pleasure in pursuing his own choice they raved i begged that they would let us eat our dinner with comfort my lord i hoped would come in with a keen appetite and nelthorpe should get a supper for him that he liked when we had dined and retired into the adjoining drawingroom i had another schoolingbout emily was even saucy but i took it all yet in my heart was vexed at lord gs perverseness at last in came the honest man he does not read this and so cannot take exceptions and i hope you will not at the word honest so lordly so stiff so solemn upon my word had it not been sunday i would have gone to my harpsichord directly he bowed to lord and lady l and to emily very obligingly to me he nodded i nodded again but like a goodnatured fool smiled he stalked to the chimney turned his back towards it buttoned up his mouth held up his glowing face as if he were disposed to crow yet had not won the battle one hand in his bosom the other under the skirt of his waistcoat and his posture firmer than his mind yet was my heart so devoid of malice that i thought his attitude very genteel and had we not been man and wife agreeable we hoped to have found your lordship at home said lord l or we should not have dined here if lord g is as polite a husband as a man said i he will not thank your lordship for this compliment to his wife lord g swelled and reared himself up his complexion which was before in a glow was heightened poor man thought i but why should my tender heart pity obstinate people yet i could not help being dutiful have you dined my lord said i with a sweet smile and very courteous he stalked to the window and never a word answered he pray lady l be so good as to ask my lord g if he has dined was not this very condescending on such a behaviour lady l asked him and as gentlyvoiced as if she were asking the same question of her own lord lady l is a kindhearted soul harriet she is my sister i have not madam to lady l turning rudely from me and not very civilly from her ah thought i these men the more they are courted wretches to find their consequence in a womans meekness yet i could not forbear shewing mine nature harriet who can resist constitution what stiff airs are these approaching him i do assure you my lord i shall not take this behaviour well and put my hand on his arm i was served right would you believe it the man shook off my condescending hand by raising his elbow scornfully he really did nay then i left him and retired to my former seat i was vexed that it was sunday i wanted a little harmony lord and lady l both blamed me by their looks and my lady took my hand and was leading me towards him i shewed a little reluctance and would you have thought it out of the drawingroom whipt my nimble lord as if on purpose to avoid being moved by my concession i took my place again i beg of you charlotte said lady l go to my lord you have used him ill when i think so i will follow your advice lady l and dont you think so lady g said lord l what for taking my own option how i would be dressed today what for deferring that moment in came my bluff lord have i not proceeded i been forced to dine without him today did he let me know what account i could give of his absence or when he would return and see now how angry he looks he traversed the room i went on did he not shake off my hand when i laid it smiling on his arm would he answer me a question which i kindly put to him fearing he had not dined and might be sick for want of eating was i not forced to apply to lady l for an answer to my careful question on his scornfully turning from me in silence might we not if he had not gone out so abruptly nobody knows where have made the appearance his heart is so set upon but now indeed it is too late oons madam said he and he kimboed his arms and strutted up to me now for a cuff thought i i was half afraid of it but out of the room again capered he lord bless me said i what a passionate creature is this lord and lady l both turned from me with indignation but no wonder if one that they both did they are a silly pair and i believe have agreed to keep each other in countenance in all they do but emily affected me she sat before in one corner of the room weeping and just then ran to me and wrapping her arms about me dear dear lady g said she for heavens sake think of what our miss byron said dont jest away your own happiness i dont say who is in fault but my dear lady do you condescend it looks pretty in a woman to condescend forgive me i will run to my lord and i will beg of him away she ran without waiting for an answer and bringing in the passionate wretch hanging on his arm you must not my lord indeed you must not be so passionate why my lord you frighted me indeed you did such a word i never heard from your lordships mouth ay my lord said i you give yourself pretty airs dont you and use pretty words that a child shall be terrified at them but come come ask my pardon for leaving me to dine without you was not that tender yet out went lord and lady l to be sure they did right if they withdrew in hopes these kind words would have been received as reconciliatory ones and not in displeasure with me as i am halfafraid they did for their goodnature worthy souls does sometimes lead them into misapprehensions i kindly laid my hand on his arm again he was ungracious nay my lord dont once more reject me with disdain if you do i then smiled most courteously carry not your absurdities my lord too far and i took his hand there harriet was condescension i protest sir if you give yourself any more of these airs you will not find me so condescending come come tell me you are sorry and i will forgive you sorry madam sorry i am indeed sorry for your provoking airs why thats not ill said but kimboed arms my lord are you not sorry for such an air and oons are you not sorry for such a word and for such looks too and for quarreling with your dinner i protest my lord you make one of us look like a child who flings away his bread and butter because it has not glass windows upon it not for one moment forbear madam prythee prythee i profess i had like to have said honest friend no more of these airs and i tell you i will forgive you but madam i cannot i will not hush hush no more in that strain and so loud as if we had lost each other in a wood if you will let us be friends say so in an instant if not i am gone gone this moment casting off from him as i may say intending to mount up stairs angel or demon shall i call you said he yet i receive your hand as offered but for gods sake madam let us be happy and he kissed my hand but not so cordially as it became him to do and in came lord and lady l with countenances a little ungracious i took my seat next my own man with an air of officiousness hoping to oblige him by it and he was obliged and another day not yet quite agreed upon this parade is to be made and thus began proceeded and ended this doughty quarrel and who knows but before the day is absolutely resolved upon we may have half a score more four five six days as it may happen is a great space of time for people to agree who are so much together and one of whom is playful and the other will not be played with but these kimbo and oons airs harriet stick a little in my stomach and the man seems not to be quite come to neither he is sullen and gloomy and dont prate away as he used to do when we have made up before but i will sing him a song tomorrow i will please the honest man if i can but he really should not have had for a wife a woman of so sweet a temper as your charlotte g letter xlii lady g to miss byron monday may my lord and i have had another little tiff shall i call it it came not up to a quarrel married people would have enough to do if they were to trouble their friends every time they misunderstood one another and now a word or two of other people not always scribbling of ourselves we have just heard that our cousin everard has added another fool of our sex to the number of the weak ones who disgrace it a sorry fellow he has been seen with her by one whom he would not know at cupers gardens dressed like a seaofficer and skulking like a thief into the privatest walks of the place when he is tired of the poor wretch he will want to accommodate with us by promises of penitence and reformation as once or twice before rakes are not only odious but they are despicable fellows you will the more clearly see this when i assure you from those who know that this silly creature our cousin is looked upon among his brother libertines and smarts as a man of first consideration he has also been seen in a gayer habit at a certain gamingtable near covent garden where he did not content himself with being an idle spectator colonel winwood our informant shook his head but made no other answer to some of our inquiries may he suffer say i a sorry fellow preparations are going on all sofast at windsor we are all invited god grant that miss mansfield may be as happy a lady w as we all conclude she will be but i never was fond of matches between sober young women and battered old rakes much good may do the adventurers drawn in by gewgaw and title poor things but convenience when thats the motive whatever foolish girls think will hold out its comforts while a gratified love quickly evaporates beauchamp who is acquainted with the mansfields is intrusted by my brother in his absence with the management of the lawaffairs he hopes he says to give a good account of them the base steward of the uncle calvert who lived as a husband with the woman who had been forced upon his superannuated master in a doting fit has been brought by the death of one of the children born in mr calverts lifetime and by the precarious health of the posthumous one to make overtures of accommodation a new hearing of the cause between them and the keelings is granted and great things are expected from it in their favour from some new lights thrown in upon that suit the keelings are frightened out of their wits it seems and are applying to sir john lambton a disinterested neighbour to offer himself as a mediator between them the mansfields will so soon be related to us that i make no apology for interesting you in their affairs be sure you chide me for my whimsical behaviour to lord g i know you will but dont blame my heart my head only is wrong a little more from fresh informations of this sorry varlet everard i wished him to suffer but i wished him not to be so very great a sufferer as it seems he is sharpers have bit his head off quite close to his shoulders they have not left it him to carry under his arm as the honest patron of france did his they lend it him however now and then to repent with and curse himself the creature he attended to cupers gardens instead of a country innocent as he expected her to be comes out to be a cast mistress experienced in all the arts of such and acting under the secret influences of a man of quality who wanting to get rid of her supports her in a prosecution commenced against him poor devil for performance of covenants he was extremely mortified on finding my brother gone abroad he intends to apply to him for his pity and help sorry fellow he boasted to us on our expectation of our brothers arrival from abroad that he would enter his cousin charles into the ways of the town now he wants to avail himself against the practices of the sons of that town by his cousins character and consequence a combination of sharpers it seems had long set him as a man of fortune but on his taking refuge with my brother gave over for a time their designs upon him till he threw himself again in their way the worthless fellow had been often liberal of his promises of marriage to young creatures of more innocence than this and thinks it very hard that he should be prosecuted for a crime which he had so frequently committed with impunity can you pity him i cannot i assure you the man who can betray and ruin an innocent woman who loves him ought to be abhorred by men would he scruple to betray and ruin them if he were not afraid of the law yet there are women who can forgive such wretches and herd with them my aunt eleanor is arrived a good plump bonnyfaced old virgin she has chosen her apartment at present we are most prodigiously civil to each other but already i suspect she likes lord g better than i would have her she will perhaps if a party should be formed against your poor charlotte make one of it will you think it time thrown away to

chamber he is thought not to be out of danger from some inward hurt which often makes him bring up blood in quantities he is miserably oppressed by lowness of spirits and when he is a little better in that respect his impatience makes his friends apprehensive for his head but has he intellects strong enough to give apprehensions of that nature fool and madman we often join as terms of reproach but i believe fools seldom run really mad merceda is in a still more dangerous way besides his bruises and a fractured skull he has it seems a wound in his thigh which in the delirium he was thrown into by the fracture was not duly attended to and which but for his valiant struggles against the knife which gave the wound was designed for a still greater mischief his recovery is despaired of and the poor wretch is continually offering up vows of penitence and reformation if his life may be spared bagenhall was the person who had seduced by promises of marriage and fled for it the manufacturers daughter of abbeville he was overtaken by his pursuers at douay the incensed father and friends of the young woman would not be otherwise pacified than by his performing his promise which with infinite reluctance he complied with principally through the threats of the brother who is noted for his fierceness and resolution and who once made the sorry creature feel an argument which greatly terrified him bagenhall is at present at abbeville living as well as he can with his new wife cursing his fate no doubt in secret he is obliged to appear fond of her before her brother and father the latter being also a sour man a gascon always boasting of his family and valuing himself upon a de affixed by himself to his name and jealous of indignity offered to it the fierce brother is resolved to accompany his sister to england when bagenhall goes thither in order as he declares to secure to her good usage and see her owned and visited by all bagenhalls friends and relations and thus much of these fine gentlemen how different a man is beauchamp but it is injuring him to think of those wretches and him at the same time he certainly has an eye to emily but behaves with great prudence towards her yet every body but she sees his regard for her nobody but her guardian runs in her head and the more as she really thinks it is a glory to love him because of his goodness every body she says has the same admiration of him that she has mrs reeves desires me to acquaint you that miss clements having by the death of her mother and aunt come into a pretty fortune is addressed to by a yorkshire gentleman of easy circumstances and is preparing to leave the town having other connexions in that county but that she intends to write to you before she goes and to beg you to favour her with now and then a letter i think miss clements is a good sort of young woman but i imagined she would have been one of those nuns at large who need not make vows of living and dying aunt eleanors or lady gertrudes all three of them good honest souls chaste pious and plain it is a charming situation when a woman is arrived at such a height of perfection as to be above giving or receiving temptation sweet innocents they have my reverence if not my love how would they be affronted if i were to say pity i think only of my two good aunts at the present writing miss clements you know is a youngish woman and i respect her much one would not jest upon the unsightliness of person or plainness of feature but think you she will not be one of those who twenty years hence may put in a boast

can tell him but i will tell him and not you adieu once more charlotte g letter xliii mr lowther to john arnold esq his brotherinlaw in london bologna may i will now my dear brother give you a circumstantial account of our short but flying journey the th of april os early in the morning we left paris and reached lyons the th at night resting but a few hours we set out for pont beauvoisin where we arrived the following evening there we bid adieu to france and found ourselves in savoy equally noted for its poverty and rocky mountains indeed it was a total change of the scene we had left behind us a blooming spring which enlivened with its verdure the trees and hedges on the road we passed and the meadows already smiled with flowers the cheerful inhabitants were busy in adjusting their limits lopping their trees pruning their vines tilling their fields but when we entered savoy nature wore a very different face and i must own that my spirits were great sufferers by the change here we began to view on the nearer mountains covered with ice and snow notwithstanding the advanced season the rigid winter in frozen majesty still preserving its domains and arriving at st jean maurienne the night of the th the snow seemed as if it would dispute with us our passage and horrible was the force of the boisterous winds which sat full in our faces overpowered by the fatigues i had undergone in the expedition we had made the unseasonable coldness of the weather and the fight of one of the worst countries under heaven still clothed in snow and deformed by continual hurricanes i was here taken ill sir charles was greatly concerned for my indisposition which was increased by a great lowness of spirits he attended upon me in person and never had man a more kind and indulgent friend here we stayed two days and then my illness being principally owing to fatigue i found myself enabled to proceed at two of the clock in the morning of the th we prosecuted our journey in palpable darkness and dismal weather though the winds were somewhat laid and reaching the foot of mount cenis by break of day arrived at lanebourg a poor little village so environed by high mountains that for three months in the twelve it is hardly visited by the cheering rays of the sun every object which here presents itself is excessively miserable the people are generally of an olive complexion with wens under their chins some so monstrous especially women as quite disfigure them here it is usual to unscrew and take in pieces the chaises in order to carry them on mules over the mountain and to put them together on the other side for the savoy side of the mountain is much more difficult to pass than the other but sir charles chose not to lose time and therefore lest the chaise to the care of the innkeeper proceeding with all expedition to gain the top of the hill the way we were carried was as follows a kind of horse as it is called with you with two poles like those of chairmen was the vehicle on which is secured a sort of elbow chair in which the traveller sits a man before another behind carry this open machine with so much swiftness that they are continually running and skipping like wild goats from rock to rock the four miles of that ascent if a traveller were not prepossessed that these mountaineers are the surestfooted carriers in the universe he would be in continual apprehensions of being overturned i who never undertook this journey before must own that i could not be so fearless on this occasion as sir charles was though he had very exactly described to me how every thing would be then though the sky was clear when we passed this mountain yet the cold wind blew quantities of frozen snow in our faces insomuch that it seemed to me just as if people were employed all the time we were passing to wound us with the sharpest needles they indeed call the wind that brings this sharppointed snow the tormenta an adventure which anywhere else might have appeared ridiculous i was afraid would have proved fatal to one of our chairmen as i will call them i had flapt down my hat to screen my eyes from the fury of that deluge of sharppointed frozensnow and it was blown off my head by a sudden gust down the precipices i gave it for lost and was about to bind a handkerchief over the woolencap which those people provide to tie under the chin when one of the assistant carriers for they are always six in number to every chair in order to relieve one another undertook to recover it i thought it impossible to be done the passage being as i imagined only practicable for birds however i promised him a crown reward if he did never could the leaps of the most dexterous of ropedancers be compared to those of this daring fellow i saw him sometimes jumping from rock to rock sometimes rolling down a declivity of snow like a ninepin sometimes running sometimes hopping skipping in short he descended like lightning to the verge of a torrent where he found the hat he came up almost as quick and appeared as little fatigued as if he had never left us we arrived at the top in two hours from lanebourg and the sun was pretty high above the horizon out of a hut halfburied in snow came some mountaineers with two poor sledges drawn by mules to carry us through the plain of mount cenis as it is called which is about four italian miles in length to the descent of the italian side of the mountain these sledges are not much different from the chairs or sedans or horse we then quitted only the two under poles are flat and not so long as the others and turning up a little at the end to hinder them from sticking fast in the snow to the foreends of the poles are fixed two round sticks about two feet and a half long which serve for a support and help to the man who guides the mule who running on the snow between the mule and the sledge holds the sticks with each hand it was diverting to see the two sledgemen striving to outrun each other encouraged by sir charless generosity we very soon arrived at the other end of the plain the man who walked or rather ran between the sledge and the mule made a continual noise hallooing and beating the stubborn beast with his fists which otherwise would be very slow in its motion at the end of this plain we found such another hut as that on the lanebourg side here they took off the smoking mules from the sledges to give them rest and now began the most extraordinary way of travelling that can be imagined the descent of the mountain from the top of this side to a small village called novalesa is four italian miles when the snow has filled up all the inequalities of the mountain it looks in many parts as smooth and equal as a sugarloaf it is on the brink of this rapid descent that they put the sledge the man who is to guide it sits between the feet of the traveller who is seated in the elbowchair with his legs at the outside of the sticks fixed at the foreends of the flat poles and holds the two sticks with his hands and when the sledge has gained the declivity its own weight carries it down with surprising celerity but as the immense irregular rocks under the snow make now and then some edges in the declivity which if not avoided would overturn the sledge the guide who foresees the danger by putting his foot strongly and dexterously in the snow next to the precipice turns the machine by help of the abovementioned sticks the contrary way and by way of zigzag goes to the bottom such was the velocity of this motion that we dispatched these four miles in less than five minutes and when we arrived at novalesa hearing that the snow was very deep most of the way to susa and being pleased with our way of travelling we had some mules put again to the sledges and ran all the way to the very gates of that city which is seven miles distant from mount cenis in our way we had a cursory view of the impregnable fortress of brunetta the greatest part of which is cut out of the solid rock and commands that important pass we rested all night at susa and having bought a very commodious postchaise we proceeded to turin where we dined and from thence the evening of may os got to parma by way of alexandria and placentia having purposely avoided the high road through milan as it would have cost us a few hours more time sir charles observed to me when we were on the plain or flat top of mount cenis that had not the winter been particularly long and severe we should have had instead of this terrible appearance of snow there flowers starting up as it were under our feet of various kinds which are hardly to be met with anywhere else one of the greatest dangers he told me in passing this mount in winter arises from a ball of snow which is blown down from the top by the wind or falls down by some other accident which gathering all the way in its descent becomes instantly of such a prodigious bigness that there is hardly any avoiding being carried away with it man and beast and smothered in it one of these balls we saw rolling down but as it took another course than ours we had no apprehension of danger from it at parma we found expecting us the bishop of nocera and a very reverend father marescotti by name who expressed the utmost joy at the arrival of sir charles grandison and received me at his recommendation with a politeness which seems natural to them i will not repeat what i have written before of this excellent young gentleman intrepidity bravery discretion as well as generosity are conspicuous parts of his character he is studious to avoid danger but is unappalled in it for humanity benevolence providence for others to his very servants i never met with his equal my reception from the noble family to which he has introduced me the patients case a very unhappy one and a description of this noble city and the fine country about it shall be the subject of my next assure all my friends of my health and good wishes for them and my dear arnold believe me to be ever yours c letter xliv sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna wednesday may i told you my dear and reverend friend that i should hardly write to you till i arrived in this city the affair of my executorship obliged me to stay a day longer at paris than i intended but i have put every thing relating to that trust in such a way as to answer all my wishes mr lowther wrote to mr arnold a friend of his in london the particulars of the extraordinary affair we were engaged in between st denis and paris with desire that he would inform my friends of our arrival at that capital we were obliged to stop two days at st jean de maurienne the expedition we travelled with was too much for mr lowther and i expected and was not disappointed from the unusual backwardness of the season to find the passage over mount cenis less agreeable than it usually is in the beginning of may the bishop of nocera had offered to meet me any where on his side of the mountains i wrote to him from lyons that i hoped to see him at parma on or about the very day that i was so fortunate as to reach the palace of the count of belvedere in that city where i found that he and father marescotti had arrived the evening before they as well as the count expressed great joy to see me and when i presented mr lowther to them with the praises due to his skill and let them know the consultations i had had with eminent physicians of my own country on lady clementinas case they invoked blessings upon us both and would not be interrupted in them by my eager questions after the health and state of mind of the two dearest persons of their family unhappy very unhappy said the bishop let us give you some refreshment before we come to particulars to my repeated inquiries jeronymo poor jeronymo said the bishop is living and that is all we can say the sight of you will be a cordial to his heart clementina is on her journey to bologna from naples you desired to find her with us and not at naples she is weak is obliged to travel slowly she will rest at urbino two or three days dear creature what has she not suffered from the cruelty of her cousin laurana as well as from her malady the general has been and is indulgent to her he is married to a lady of great merit quality and fortune he has at length consented that we shall try this last experiment as the hearts of my mother and now lately of my father as well as mine are in it his lady would not be denied accompanying my sister and as my brother could not bear being absent from her he travels with them i wish he had stayed at naples i hope however he will be as ready as you will find us all to acknowledge the favour of this visit and the fatigue and trouble you have given yourself on our account as to my sisters bodily health proceeded he it is greatly impaired we are almost hopeless with regard to the state of her mind she speaks not she answers not any questions camilla is with her she seems regardless of any body else she has been told that the general is married his lady makes great court to her but she heeds her not we are in hopes that my mother on her return to bologna will engage her attention she never yet was so bad as to forget her duty either to god or her parents sometimes camilla thinks she pays some little attention to your name but then she instantly starts as in terror looks round her with fear puts her finger to her lips as if she dreaded her cruel cousin laurana should be told of her having heard it mentioned the bishop and father both regretted that she had been denied the requested interview they were now they said convinced that if that had been granted and she had been left to mrs beaumonts friendly care a happy issue might have been hoped for but now said the bishop then sighed and was silent i despatched saunders early the next morning to bologna to procure convenient lodgings for me and mr lowther in the afternoon we set out for that city the count of belvedere found an opportunity to let me know his unabated passion for clementina and that he had lately made overtures to marry her notwithstanding her malady having been advised he said by proper persons that as it was not an hereditary but an accidental disorder it might be in time curable he accompanied us about half way in our journey and at parting remember chevalier whispered he that clementina is the soul of my hope i cannot forego that hope no other woman will i ever call mine i heard him in silence i admired him for his attachment i pitied him he said he would tell me more of his mind at bologna we reached bologna on the th ns saunders had engaged for me the lodgings i had before our conversation on the road turned chiefly on the case of signor jeronymo the bishop and father were highly pleased with the skill founded on practice which evidently appeared in all that mr lowther said on the subject and the bishop once intimated that be the event what it would his journey to italy should be made the most beneficial affair to him he had ever engaged in mr lowther replied that as he was neither a necessitous nor a meanspirited man and had reason to be entirely satisfied with the terms i had already secured to him he should take it unkindly if any other reward were offered him think my dear dr bartlett what emotions i must have on entering once more the gates of the porretta palace though clementina was not there i hastened up to my jeronymo who had been apprized of my arrival the moment he saw me do i once more said he behold my friend my grandison let me embrace the dearest of men now now have i lived long enough he bowed his head upon his pillow and meditated me his countenance shining with pleasure in defiance of pain the bishop entered he could not be present at our first interview my lord said jeronymo make it your care that my dear friend be treated by every soul of our family with the gratitude and respect which are due to his goodness methinks i am easier and happier this moment than i have been for the tedious space of time since i last saw him he named that space of time to the day and to the very hour of the day the marquis and marchioness signifying their pleasure to see me the bishop led me to them my reception from the marquis was kind from his lady it was as that of a mother to a longabsent son i had ever been she was pleased to say a fourth son in her eye and now that she had been informed that i had brought over with me a surgeon of experience and the advice in writing of eminent physicians of my country the obligations i had laid on their whole family whatever were the success were unreturnable i asked leave to introduce mr lowther to them they received him with great politeness and recommended their jeronymo to his best skill mr lowthers honest heart was engaged by a reception so kind he never he told me afterwards beheld so much pleasure and pain struggling in the same countenance as in that of the lady so fixed a melancholy as in that of the marquis mr lowther is a man of spirit though a modest man he is as on every proper occasion i found a man of piety and has a heart tender as manly such a man heart and hand is qualified for a profession which is the most useful and certain in the art of healing he is a man of sense and learning out of his profession and happy in his address the two surgeons who now attend signor jeronymo are both of this country they were sent for with the approbation and at the request of the family i presented mr lowther to them but first gave them his character as a modest man as a man of skill and experience and told them that he had quitted business and wanted not either fame or fortune they acquainted him with the case and their methods of proceeding mr lowther assisted in the dressings that very evening jeronymo would have me to be present mr lowther suggested an alteration in their method but in so easy and gentle a manner as if he doubted not but such was their intention when the state of the wounds would admit of that method of treatment that the gentlemen came readily into it a great deal of matter had been collected by means of the wrong methods pursued and he proposed if the patients strength would bear it to make an aperture below the principal wound in order to discharge the matter downward and he suggested the dressing with hollow tents and bandage and to dismiss the large tents with which they had been accustomed to distend the wound to the extreme anguish of the patient on pretence of keeping it open to assist the discharge let me now give you my dear friend a brief history of my jeronymos case and of the circumstances which have attended it by which you will be able to account for the difficulties of it and how it has happened that in such a space of time either the cure was not effected or that the patient yielded not to the common destiny in lingering cases patients or their friends are sometimes too apt to blame their physicians and to listen to new recommendations the surgeons attending this unhappy case had been more than once changed signor jeronymo it seems was unskilfully treated by the young surgeon of cremona who was first engaged he neglected the most dangerous wound and when he attended to it managed it wrong for want of experience he is therefore very properly dismissed the unhappy man had at first three wounds one in his breast which had been for some time healed one in his shoulder which through his own impatience having been too suddenly healed up was obliged to be laid open again the other which is the most dangerous in the hipjoint a surgeon of this place and another of padua were next employed the cure not advancing a surgeon of eminence from paris was sent for mr lowther tells me that this mans method was by far the most eligible but that he undertook too much since from the first there could not be any hope from the nature of the wound in the hipjoint that the patient could ever walk without sticks or crutches and of this opinion were the other two surgeons but the french gentleman was so very pragmatical that he would neither draw with them nor give reasons for what he did regarding them only as his assistants they could not long bear this usage and gave up to him in disgust how cruel is punctilio among men of this science in cases of difficulty and danger the present operators when the two others had given up were not but by leave of the french gentleman called in he valuing himself on his practice in the royal hospital of invalids at paris looked upon them as theorists only and treated them with as little ceremony as he had shewn the others so that at last from their frequent differences it became necessary to part with either him or them his pride when he knew that this question was a subject of debate would not allow him to leave the family an option he made his demand it was complied with and he returned to paris from what this gentleman threw out at parting to the disparagement of the two others signor jeronymo suspected their skill and from a hint of this suspicion as soon as i knew i should be welcome myself i procured the favour of mr lowthers attendance all mr lowthers fear is that signor jeronymo has been kept too long in hand by the different managements of the several operators and that he will sink under the necessary process through weakness of habit but however he is of opinion that it is requisite to confine him to a strict diet and to deny him wine and fermented liquors in which he has hitherto been indulged against the opinion of his own operators who have been too complaisant to his appetite an operation somewhat severe was performed on his shoulder yesterday morning the italian surgeons complimented mr lowther with the lancet they both praised his dexterity and signor jeronymo who will be consulted on every thing that he is to suffer blessed his gentle hand at mr lowthers request a physician was yesterday consulted who advised some gentle aperitives as his strength will bear it and some balsamics to sweeten the blood and juices mr lowther told me just now that the fault of the gentlemen who have now the care of him has not been want of skill but of critical courage and a too great solicitude to oblige their patient which by their own account had made them forego several opportunities which had offered to assist nature in short sir said he your friend knows too much of his own case to be ruled and too little to qualify him to direct what is to be done especially as symptoms must have been frequently changing mr lowther doubts not he says but he shall soon convince jeronymo that he merits his confidence and then he will exact it from him and in so doing shall not only give weight to his own endeavours to serve him but rid the other two gentlemen of embarrasments which have often given them diffidences when resolution was necessary in the mean time the family here are delighted with mr lowther they will flatter themselves they say with hopes of their jeronymos recovery which however mr lowther for fear of disappointment does not encourage jeronymo himself owns that his spirits are much revived and we all know the power that the mind has over the body thus have i given you my reverend friend a general notion of jeronymos case as i understand it from mr lowthers as general representation of it he has prevailed upon him to accept of an apartment adjoining to that of his patient jeronymo said that when he knows he has so skilful a friend near him he shall go to rest with confidence and good rest is of the highest consequence to him what a happiness my dear dr bartlett will fall to my share if i may be an humble instrument in the hand of providence to heal this brother and if his recovery shall lead the way to the restoration of his sister each so known a lover of the other that the world is more ready to attribute her malady to his misfortune and danger than to any other cause but how early days are these on which my love and my compassion for persons so meritorious embolden me to build such forward hopes lady clementina is now impatiently expected by every one she is at urbino the general and his lady are with her his haughty spirit cannot bear to think she should see me or that my attendance on her should be thought of so much importance to her the marchioness in a conversation that i have just now had with her hinted this to me and besought me to keep my temper if his high notion of family and female honour should carry him out of his usual politeness i will give you my dear friend the particulars of this conversation she began with saying that she did not for her part now think that her beloved daughter whom once she believed hardly any private man could deserve was worthy of me even were she to recover her reason i could not but guess the meaning of so high a compliment what answer could i return that would not on one hand be capable of being thought cool on the other of being supposed interested and as if i were looking forward to a reward that some of the family still think too high but while i knew my own motives i could not be displeased with a lady who was not at liberty to act in this point according to her own will i only said and it was with truth that the calamity of the noble lady had endeared her to me more than it was possible the most prosperous fortune could have done i my good chevalier may say any thing to you we are undetermined about every thing we know not what to propose what to consent to your journey on the first motion though but from some of us the dear creature continuing ill you in possession of a considerable estate exercising yourself in doing good in your native country you must think we took all opportunities of inquiring after the man once so likely to be one of us the first fortune in italy olivia though she is not a clementina pursuing you in hopes of calling herself yours for to england we hear she went and there you own she is what obligations have you laid upon us what can we determine upon what can we wish providence and you madam shall direct my steps i am in yours and your lords power the same uncertainty from the same unhappy cause leaves me not the thought because not the power of determination the recovery of lady clementina and her brother without a view to my own interest fills up at present all the wishes of my heart let me ask said the lady it is for my own private satisfaction were such a happy event as to clementina to take place could you would you think yourself bound by your former offers when i made those offers madam the situation on your side was the same that it is now lady clementina was unhappy in her mind my fortune it is true is higher it is indeed as high as i wish it to be i then declared that if you would give me your clementina without insisting on one hard on one indispensable article i would renounce her fortune and trust to my fathers goodness to me for a provision shall my accession to the estate of my ancestors alter me no madam i never yet made an offer that i receded from the circumstances continuing the same if in the article of residence the marquis and you and clementina would relax i would acknowledge myself indebted to your goodness but without conditioning for it i told you said she that i put this question only for my own private satisfaction and i told you truth i never will deceive or mislead you whenever i speak to you it shall be as if even in your own concerns i spoke to a third person and i shall not doubt but you will have the generosity to advise as such though against yourself may i be enabled to act worthy of your good opinion i madam look upon myself as bound you and yours are free what a pleasure is it my dear dr bartlett to the proud heart of your friend that i could say this had i sought in pursuance of my own inclinations to engage the affections of the admirable miss byron as i might with honour have endeavoured to do had not the woes of this noble family and the unhappy state of mind of their clementina so deeply affected me i might have involved myself and that loveliest of women in difficulties which would have made such a heart as mine still more unhappy than it is let me know my dear dr bartlett that miss byron is happy i rejoice whatever be my own destiny that i have not involved her in my uncertainties the countess of d is a worthy woman the earl her son is a good young man miss byron merits such a mother the countess such a daughter how dear how important is her welfare to me you know your grandison my good dr bartlett her friendship i presumed to ask i dared not to wish to correspond with her i rejoice for her sake that i trusted not my heart with such a proposal what difficulties my dear friend have i had to encounter with god be praised that i have nothing with regard to these two incomparable women to reproach myself with i am persuaded that our prudence if rashly we throw not ourselves into difficulties and if we will exert it and make a reliance on the proper assistance is generally proportioned to our trials i asked the marchioness after lady sforza and her daughter laurana and whether they were at milan you have heard no doubt answered she the cruel treatment that my poor child met with from her cousin laurana lady sforza justifies her in it we are upon extreme bad terms on that account they are both at milan the general has vowed that he never will see them more if he can avoid it the bishop only as a christian can forgive them you chevalier know the reason why we cannot allow our clementina to take the veil the particular reasons i have not madam been inquisitive about but have always understood them to be family ones grounded on the dying request of one of her grandfathers our daughter sir is entitled to a considerable estate which joins to our own domains it was purchased for her by her two grandfathers who vied with each other in demonstrating their love of her by solid effects one of them my father was in his youth deeply in love with a young lady of great merit and she was thought to love him but in a fit of pious bravery as he used to call it when everything between themselves and between the friends on both sides was concluded on she threw herself into a convent and passing steadily through the probationary forms took the veil but afterwards repented and took pains to let it be known that she was unhappy this gave him a disgust against the sequestered life though he was in other respects a zealous catholic and clementina having always a serious turn in order to deter her from embracing it both grandfathers being desirous of strengthening their house as well in the female as male line they inserted a clause in each of their wills by which they gave the estate designed for her in case she took the veil to laurana and her descendants laurana to enter into possession of it on the day that clementina should be professed but if clementina married laurana was then to be entitled only to a handsome legacy that she might not be entirely disappointed for the reversion in case clementina had no children was to go to our eldest son who however has been always generously solicitous to have his sister marry both grandfathers were rich our son giacomo on my fathers death as he had willed entered upon a considerable estate in the kingdom of naples which had for ages been in my family he is therefore and will be greatly provided for our second son has great prospects before him in the church but you know he cannot marry poor jeronymo we had not before his misfortune any great hopes of strengthening the family by his means he alas as you well know who took such laudable pains to reclaim him before we knew you with great qualities imbibed free notions from bad company and declared himself a despiser of marriage this the two grandfathers knew and often deplored for jeronymo and clementina were equally their favourites to him and the bishop they bequeathed great legacies we suspected not till very lately that laurana was deeply in love with the count of belvedere and that her mother and she had views to drive our sweet child into a convent that laurana might enjoy the estate which they hoped would be an inducement to the count to marry her cruel laurana cruel lady sforza so much love as they both pretended to our child and i believe had till the temptation strengthened by power became too strong for them unhappy the day that we put her into their hands besides the estate so bequeathed to clementina we can do great things for her few italian families are so rich as ours her brothers forget their own interest when it comes into competition with hers she is as generous as they our four children never knew what a contention was but who should give up an advantage to the other this child this sweet child was ever the delight of us all and likewise of our brother the conte della porretta what joy would her recovery and nuptials give us dear creature we have sometimes thought that she is the fonder of the sequestered life as it is that which we wish her not to embrace but can clementina be perverse she cannot yet that was the life of her choice when she had a choice her grandfathers wishes notwithstanding will you now wonder chevalier that neither our sons nor we can allow clementina to take the veil can we so reward laurana for her cruelty especially now that we suspect the motives for her barbarity could i have thought that my sister sforza but what will not love and avarice do their powers united to compass the same end the one reigning in the bosom of the mother the other in that of the daughter alas alas they have between them broken the spirit of my clementina the very name of laurana gives her terror so far is she sensible but o sir her sensibility appears only when she is harshly treated to tenderness she had been too much accustomed to make her think an indulgent treatment new or unusual i dread my dear dr bartlett yet am impatient to see the unhappy lady i wish the general were not to accompany her i am afraid i shall want temper if he forget his my own heart when it tells me that i have not
