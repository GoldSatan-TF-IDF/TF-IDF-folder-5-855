the september harvest edgar million the september harvest of course the elderly gentleman told the apprehensive looking couple sitting in front of him we are only a midtier public school but we do provide an excellent education however he raised a hand in warning at this entrypoint we can only allow you with access to the luck and wellbeing of around one hundred plebeians the couple looked at the headteacher then glanced at each other wondering if theyd heard him correctly the head noticing the bemused look on their faces shifted in his seat then shuffled his papers as if looking for a fact hed missed ah he said looking back up with the amiable grin of a man whod just solved an especially difficult crossword puzzle and bearing the eccentric countenance and fashion sense of one of bertie woosters elderly relatives as he reconsidered his words apologies are due it seems just realised youre not part of our usual intake you are i believe new to all this old grammar school graduates i see gary and cassandra both nodded well then he said i have a little explaining to do i need to veer away from my well rehearsed speech it is so very pleasant to make a different address for a change for a moment the head seemed to look through them and the wood panelled comfort of his office to some other place then he found himself again you know how in life people will say its not what you know but who well this is true but luck also plays an important part its true gary nodded i fluked the plus one less percentage point and id probably be working the night shift in the warehouse behind morrisons with my brother joe but i still dont quite understand your point well the head said then looked around as if someone else might be watching there is another saying you may be familiar with you make your own luck cassandra groaned inwardly at the clich√© wondering for a moment if they were really considering paying a more than considerable almost but not quite unaffordable sum for their only child to be exposed to hackneyed nonsense like this but despite her usual candour when faced with well weaker minded individuals the pomp of her surroundings had glued her tongue to the base of her mouth well the saying is truer than many people realise an inalienable fact of existence in fact with this he withdrew two sheets of paper from a leather pouch thick heavy parchment which smelt of money and power but i cant tell you about it not yet anyway not until youve signed up signedup to what youve heard of the official secrets act he asked yes well this is a more ancient more binding version of that the treatise of sighs the official secrets act had this one in mind when created but lacks some of the weight of this one once you sign if you sign of course you will not be able to discuss its contents with anyone other than yourselves or other members of this rather exclusive club cassandra tried to shoo away the sceptical look now adorning her face but as her mother had always told her her face was an open window without the net curtains you could always see what was going on and the neighbours were sure to to talk my dear he said to her noting her growing scepticism brushed a hand across her arm with fingers with seemed impossibly soft and delicate almost like suede i know i know it sounds ridiculous but it is true i am about to let you into the biggest secret of the british public school system of the global private school system even but before i can i need you to sign the treatise its a kind of old fashioned nondisclosure form cant tell you otherwise and our meeting will be brought to an untimely demise i would so hate that i do think despite your background originally youre our kind of people gary took the document then cast his eyes down the page cassandra speedreading phrases like binding contract and ancient and solemn treatise over his shoulder if this is a ruse she thought theyve not skimped on the details she watched gary scratch his neat little signature onto the yellowed paper without hesitation it was something she admired about him he had a straightforward just get on with it approach to life and if he was sometimes a little unsubtle he lacked the doubts which lingered behind the smart even spiky woman her colleagues thought they knew what the hell she thought hes signing then dammit why not she asked herself they werent committed to sending him to this ridiculous place just not to reveal the heads absurd secret so she snatched the pen from garys hand and added her own name to the charade let him tell his stories cassandra was a confident successful woman used to being in charge to take charge but as she finished the final squiggle on the final n in her surname she wondered if she knew anything at all knew for one certain moment she had never known anything or been right about anything at all it seemed as though all the air was sucked from the room and she could have sworn she heard a scream somewhere in the distance almost a banshee wail which began to subside but was replaced with a thousand agonised screams or more seeming to pour out of the bricks which supported the clock tower above their heads she could hear souls weeping which were there and then all of a sudden not there all was dark in the world and she too wanted to weep and flee then just as quickly the wave of terror passed there was air again and light she could breathe the head stared at her out of eyes which now reminded her of cats hunters eyes so she looked away while she tried to gather her thoughts had it been real meeting garys eye she could tell hed felt it too but as the room returned to its formerly airy state the smell of fresh cut grass gusting in from perfect green gardens which had reminded cassandra of downton abbey she began to wonder if maybe shed imagined it maybe he drugged the green tea she thought looking down into her bone china cup as though she were trying to read the leaves a stupid expression on her face then glanced back around the office not for the first time thinking it wouldnt be out of place in hogwarts a mid tier school indeed she thought recalling the grey concrete sixties monstrosity theyd visited in walthamstow yesterday a sullen looking gang of scowling boys scowling at their mercedes as it passed after the open evening where an edgy giant of a man bounded about the stage talking about their superb support systems and all the extra funding they had these days from pupil premium they returned to find a key shaped fingerprint gouged along its silver side the lefthand side mirror dangled from its socket gentrification was all well and good but it hadnt extended to the school system as far as she could tell all very well to be able to have good coffee and pastries to be able buy quinoa and edamame beans but what was the point if your child sounded like them the smudgy looking boys whod vandalise your car the moment your back turned the head picked up the document and scrutinised the signature for a few seconds then apparently satisfied returned his spotlight gaze onto the couple mr and mrs harrison the secret i am going to let you in on is that public schools in britain whilst selling education are also stocking something rather more important good fortune now i can see you look rather sceptical at this and i quite understand however this is indeed what we are selling cassandra was beginning to think this might not be the school for their boy maybe they should reconsider the local comprehensive it scored okay in the ofsted reports not spectacular but solid maybe she was just being a snob then she remembered the smudgy boys i dont think so she thought another public school then away from this demented man this elderly gent was clearly off his trolley and given the eye watering fees they charged well youd prefer the teachers to be sane wouldnt you where you get the er luck asked gary we harvest it using a centuries old process the mode we use now was originally developed by sir isaac newton but great minds have refined it ever since the progress we made during the industrial revolution was magnificent computers have made it all very efficient the unwritten history of the british people okay cassandra said then glanced at gary then the door considering making a run for it but wondering how to signal gary to coordinate the move so where do you obtain the luck from the head looked surprised as if he were unused to repeating himself i already explained from the plebeians the proles the great unwashed look cassandra began but the head interrupted her this is difficult youre new to the system but what the general population does not know is that we are able to harvest luck remove it from one child from many children in point of fact then bestow it upon another one other at the price point youve opted for your child will absorb the luck of a small street in lets see now ah east london or birmingham scunthorpe even of course its hard to harvest it from everyone how else could we explain you two slipping through but we can absorb most of these days cassandra saw garys face cloud contemplating the strange offer she guessed he was thinking of his brother he lived in dagenham now since walthamstows new elite priced him out inhabiting a squat red brick terrace with a loud lively brood of bestial boys who constantly sought to hit each other and destroy things little randolph had been terrified at first but what really scared cassandra was the way he so quickly took to their primitive games she saw him for a moment as he was a caveman standing in a forest holding a spear more than ever at that moment she knew she must channel the beast inside if the boy were to grow into a man she could love she shook her head trying to straighten things out could this be true could you steal the luck of others cassandra could hear garys brother now mocking he and cassandra for being posh too good for the likes of us he kept saying and his beastly boys then mimicked their father in shrill estuary tones the head was holding up graphs with the names of streets in poorer areas showing just how much luck there was to be extracted along with another chart showing the schools successful alumni featuring several bbc presenters and other minor celebrities surely when you send your child to a fee paying school what youre buying is the best education money can buy asked cassandra and that is the thing which will guarantee success make our clever little boy into a welleducated grown up the head wore a patronising look upon his face have you met many expublic school types well of course theres barely a consultant or senior manager in my office who cant tell you about his spiffing public school days good and your experience of dealing with them the head prodded are they all terribly clever well some of them are and some of them arent theyre all quite well spoken and they all have that same air as each other like the world was borne to do their bidding but no not really clever they just like us really but the word balanced a moment on her lips then took flight lucky the head smiled a knowing look replacing the patronising one so you can take the luck of any street in east london and give it to our boy gary asked why of course gary youre not buying this surely cassandra asked arent i you felt it the same as me didnt you when we signed that was power a glimpse of another world he said then held up his iphone call your mum tell her about this mad thing weve been offered why just a feeling ive got the head nodded and smiled in agreement as he watched and waited for the call to connect hi mum its me yes were at the school i told you about i need to tell you something she paused for a second as if struggling for thee words well theres this mad thing they have a statue in the drive of a man juggling an ox i mean sorry what i meant was theres that in my garden theres a pink door painted orange cassandra trailed off unable to find words to discuss the offer then instead began to placate a worried parent sorry mum no im okay just excited about it all and had an extra glass of prosecco ill call later the head smiled once again and cassandra half expected to see vampire teeth mixed in with human but his gnashers seemed normal enough then he held out printed sheets which appeared looked like a slender working class edition of index from an atoz cassandra watched gary skim the pages scanning the list then stop with a satisfied hmmm okay he said to the head were in the head looked to cassandra who agreed trying not to recall the screams and moans shed heard earlier gary handed the booklet back to the head pages bent open and his thumb pressed hard on an address cassandra knew without looking where it was ah the headmaster said slight problem there thats an awfully long street im afraid youd only get about a few hundred metres of it this isnt eton after all gary ran his finger down the house numbers and cassandra saw him settle on his brothers address there he said let me have that one
