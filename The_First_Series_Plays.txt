coming through the curtains the time is halfpast eight wheeler brisk person enters with a dustpan and mrs jones more slowly with a scuttle wheeler drawing the curtains that precious husband of yours was round for you after youd gone yesterday mrs jones wanted your money for drink i suppose he hangs about the corner here half the time i saw him outside the goat and bells when i went to the post last night if i were you i would nt live with him i would nt live with a man that raised his hand to me i wouldnt put up with it why dont you take your children and leave him if you put up with im itll only make him worse i never can see why because a mans married you he should knock you about mrs jones slim darkeyed and darkhaired ovalfaced and with a smooth soft even voice her manner patient her way of talking quite impersonal she wears a blue linen dress and boots with holes it was nearly two last night before he come home and he wasnt himself he made me get up and he knocked me about he didnt seem to know what he was saying or doing of course i would leave him but im really afraid of what hed do to me he s such a violent man when hes not himself wheeler why dont you get him locked up youll never have any peace until you get him locked up if i were you id go to the police court tomorrow thats what i would do mrs jones of course i ought to go because he does treat me so badly when hes not himself but you see bettina he has a very hard time he s been out of work two months and it preys upon his mind when hes in work he behaves himself much better its when hes out of work that hes so violent wheeler well if you wont take any steps you ll never get rid of him mrs jones of course its very wearing to me i dont get my sleep at nights and it s not as if i were getting help from him because i have to do for the children and all of us and he throws such dreadful things up at me talks of my having men to follow me about such a thing never happens no man ever speaks to me and of course its just the other way its what he does thats wrong and makes me so unhappy and then he s always threatenin to cut my throat if i leave him its all the drink and things preying on his mind he s not a bad man really sometimes hell speak quite kind to me but ive stood so much from him i dont feel it in me to speak kind back but just keep myself to myself and hes all right with the children too except when hes not himself wheeler you mean when hes drunk the beauty mrs jones yes without change of voice theres the young gentleman asleep on the sofa they both look silently at jack mrs jones at last in her soft voice he does nt look quite himself wheeler hes a young limb thats what he is it s my belief he was tipsy last night like your husband it s another kind of bein out of work that sets him to drink i ll go and tell marlow this is his job she goes mrs jones upon her knees begins a gentle sweeping jack waking whos there what is it mrs jones its me sir mrs jones jack sitting up and looking round where is it what what time is it mrs jones its getting on for nine oclock sir jack for nine why what rising and loosening his tongue putting hands to his head and staring hard at mrs jones look here you mrsmrs jones dont you say you caught me asleep here mrs jones no sir of course i wont sir jack its quite an accident i dont know how it happened i must have forgotten to go to bed its a queer thing i ve got a most beastly headache mind you dont say anything mrs jones goes out and passes marlow in the doorway marlow is young and quiet he is cleanshaven and his hair is brushed high from his forehead in a coxcomb incidentally a butler he is first a man he looks at mrs jones and smiles a private smile marlow not the first time and wont be the last looked a bit dicky eh mrs jones mrs jones he did nt look quite himself of course i did nt take notice marlow youre used to them hows your old man mrs jones softly as throughout well he was very bad last night he did nt seem to know what he was about he was very late and he was most abusive but now of course hes asleep marlow thats his way of finding a job eh mrs jones as a rule mr marlow he goes out early every morning looking for work and sometimes he comes in fit to drop and of course i cant say he does nt try to get it because he does trades very bad she stands quite still her fan and brush before her at the beginning and the end of long vistas of experience traversing them with her impersonal eye but hes not a good husband to me last night he hit me and he was so dreadfully abusive marlow bank oliday eh he s too fond of the goat and bells thats whats the matter with him i see him at the corner late every night he hangs about mrs jones he gets to feeling very low walking about all day after work and being refused so often and then when he gets a drop in him it goes to his head but he shouldnt treat his wife as he treats me sometimes i ve had to go and walk about at night when he wouldnt let me stay in the room but hes sorry for it afterwards and he hangs about after me he waits for me in the street and i dont think he ought to because i ve always been a good wife to him and i tell him mrs barthwick wouldnt like him coming about the place but that only makes him angry and he says dreadful things about the gentry of course it was through me that he first lost his place through his not treating me right and thats made him bitter against the gentry he had a very good place as groom in the country but it made such a stir because of course he did nt treat me right marlow got the sack mrs jones yes his employer said he couldnt keep him because there was a great deal of talk and he said it was such a bad example but its very important for me to keep my work here i have the three children and i dont want him to come about after me in the streets and make a disturbance as he sometimes does marlow holding up the empty decanter not a drain next time he hits you get a witness and go down to the court mrs jones yes i think i ve made up my mind i think i ought to marlow thats right wheres the ciga he searches for the silver box he looks at mrs jones who is sweeping on her hands and knees he checks himself and stands reflecting from the tray he picks two halfsmoked cigarettes and reads the name on them nestor where the deuce with a meditative air he looks again at mrs jones and taking up jacks overcoat he searches in the pockets wheeler with a tray of breakfast things comes in marlow aside to wheeler have you seen the cigarettebox wheeler no marlow well its gone i put it on the tray last night and hes been smoking showing her the ends of cigarettes its not in these pockets he cant have taken it upstairs this morning have a good look in his room when he comes down whos

with pan and brush marlow and wheeler look each other in the face marlow itll turn up wheeler hesitating you dont think she nodding at the door marlow stoutly i donti never believes anything of anybody wheeler but the masterll have to be told marlow you wait a bit and see if it dont turn up suspicions no business of ours i set my mind against it the curtain falls the curtain rises again at once scene iii barthwick and mrs barthwick are seated at the breakfast table he is a man between fifty and sixty quietly important with a bald forehead and pincenez and the times in his hand she is a lady of nearly fifty well dressed with greyish hair good features and a decided manner they face each other barthwick from behind his paper the labour man has got in at the byelection for barnside my dear mrs barthwick another labour i cant think what on earth the country is about barthwick i predicted it its not a matter of vast importance mrs barthwick not how can you take it so calmly john to me its simply outrageous and there you sit you liberals and pretend to encourage these people barthwick frowning the representation of all parties is necessary for any proper reform for any proper social policy mrs barthwick ive no patience with your talk of reform all that nonsense about social policy we know perfectly well what it is they want they want things for themselves those socialists and labour men are an absolutely selfish set of people they have no sense of patriotism like the upper classes they simply want what weve got barthwick want what weve got he stares into space my dear what are you talking about with a contortion i m no alarmist mrs barthwick cream quite uneducated men wait until they begin to tax our investments i m convinced that when they once get a chance they will tax everything they ve no feeling for the country you liberals and conservatives you re all alike you dont see an inch before your noses youve no imagination not a scrap of imagination between you you ought to join hands and nip it in the bud barthwick you re talking nonsense how is it possible for liberals and conservatives to join hands as you call it that shows how absurd it is for womenwhy the very essence of a liberal is to trust in the people mrs barthwick now john eat your breakfast as if there were any real difference between you and the conservatives all the upper classes have the same interests to protect and the same principles calmly oh youre sitting upon a volcano john barthwick what mrs barthwick i read a letter in the paper yesterday i forget the mans name but it made the whole thing perfectly clear you dont look things in the face barthwick indeed heavily i am a liberal drop the subject please mrs barthwick toast i quite agree with what this man says education is simply ruining the lower classes it unsettles them and thats the worst thing for us all i see an enormous difference in the manner of servants barthwick with suspicious emphasis i welcome any change that will lead to something better he opens a letter hm this is that affair of master jacks again high street oxford sir we have received mr john barthwick seniors draft for forty pounds oh the letters to him we now enclose the cheque you cashed with us which as we stated in our previous letter was not met on presentation at your bank we are sir yours obediently moss and sons tailors h m staring at the cheque a pretty business altogether the boy might have been prosecuted mrs barthwick come john you know jack did nt mean anything he only thought he was overdrawing i still think his bank ought to have cashed that cheque they must know your position barthwick replacing in the envelope the letter and the cheque much good that would have done him in a court of law he stops as jack comes in fastening his waistcoat and staunching a razor cut upon his chin jack sitting down between them and speaking with an artificial joviality sorry i m late he looks lugubriously at the dishes tea please mother any letters for me barthwick hands the letter to him but look here i say this has been opened i do wish you would nt barthwick touching the envelope i suppose i m entitled to this name jack sulkily well i cant help having your name father he reads the letter and mutters brutes barthwick eyeing him you dont deserve to be so well out of that jack havent you ragged me enough dad mrs barthwick yes john let jack have his breakfast barthwick if you hadnt had me to come to where would you have been its the merest accident suppose you had been the son of a poor man or a clerk obtaining money with a cheque you knew your bank could not meet it might have ruined you for life i cant see whats to become of you if these are your principles i never did anything of the sort myself jack i expect you always had lots of money if youve got plenty of money of course barthwick on the contrary i had not your advantages my father kept me very short of money jack how much had you dad barthwick its not material the question is do you feel the gravity of what you did jack i dont know about the gravity of course i m very sorry if you think it was wrong have nt i said so i should

jolly bad mrs barthwick im so sorry come with me dear ill give you something that will take it away at once they leave the room and barthwick tearing up the letter goes to the fireplace and puts the pieces in the fire while he is doing this marlow comes in and looking round him is about quietly to withdraw barthwick whats that what d you want marlow i was looking for mr john sir barthwick what d

none of the maids as for cook barthwick oh cook mrs barthwick of course its perfectly detestable to me to suspect anybody barthwick it is not a question of ones feelings its a question of justice on

a short struggle and jones is overpowered mrs jones raises her hands avid drops her face on them the curtain falls scene ii the barthwicks diningroom the same evening the barthwicks are seated at dessert mrs barthwick john a silence broken by the cracking of nuts john barthwick i wish youd speak about the nuts theyre uneatable he puts one in his mouth mrs barthwick its not the season for them i called on the holyroods barthwick fills his glass with port jack crackers please dad barthwick passes the crackers his demeanour is reflective mrs barthwick lady holyrood has got very stout i ve noticed it coming for a long time barthwick gloomily stout he takes up the crackers with transparent airiness the holyroods had some trouble with their servants had nt they jack crackers please dad barthwick passing the crackers it got into the papers the cook was nt it mrs barthwick no the ladys maid i was talking it over with lady holyrood the girl used to have her young man to see her barthwick uneasily im not sure they were wise mrs barthwick my dear john what are you talking about how could there be any alternative think of the effect on the other servants barthwick of course in principle i wasnt thinking of that jack maliciously crackers please dad barthwick is compelled to pass the crackers mrs barthwick lady holyrood told me i had her up she said i said to her youll leave my house at once i think your conduct disgraceful i cant tell i dont know and i dont wish to know what you were doing i send you away on principle you need not come to me for a character and the girl said if you dont give me my notice my lady i want a months wages im perfectly respectable ive done nothing done nothing barthwick hm mrs barthwick servants have too much license they hang together so terribly you never can tell what theyre really thinking its as if they were all in a conspiracy to keep you in the dark even with marlow you feel that he never lets you know whats really in his mind i hate that secretiveness it destroys all confidence i feel sometimes i should like to shake him jack marlows a most decent chap its simply beastly every one knowing your affairs barthwick the less you say about that the better mrs barthwick it goes all through the lower classes you can not tell when they are speaking the truth today when i was shopping after leaving the holyroods one of these unemployed came up and spoke to me i suppose i only had twenty yards or so to walk to the carnage but he seemed to spring up in the street barthwick ah you must be very careful whom you speak to in these days mrs barthwick i did nt answer him of course but i could see at once that he wasnt telling the truth barthwick cracking a nut theres one very good rule look at their eyes jack crackers please dad barthwick passing the crackers if their eyes are straight forward i sometimes give them sixpence it s against my principles but its most difficult to refuse if you see that theyre desperate and dull and shiftylooking as so many of them are its certain to mean drink or crime or something unsatisfactory mrs barthwick this man had dreadful eyes he looked as if he could commit a murder i ve ad nothing to eat today he said just like that barthwick what was william about he ought to have been waiting jack raising his wineglass to his nose is this the dad barthwick holding his wineglass to his eye lowers it and passes it before his nose mrs barthwick i hate people that cant speak the truth father and son exchange a look behind their port it s just as easy to speak the truth as not ive always found it easy enough it makes it impossible to tell what is genuine one feels as if one were continually being taken in barthwick sententiously the lower classes are their own enemies if they would only trust us they would get on so much better mrs barthwick but even then its so often their own fault look at that mrs jones this morning barthwick i only want to do whats right in that matter i had occasion to see roper this afternoon i mentioned it to him hes coming in this evening it all depends on what the detective says ive had my doubts ive been thinking it over mrs barthwick the woman impressed me most unfavourably she seemed to have no shame that affair she was talking about she and the man when they were young so immoral and before you and jack i could have put her out of the room barthwick oh i dont want to excuse them but in looking at these matters one must consider mrs barthwick perhaps youll say the mans employer was wrong in dismissing him barthwick of course not its not there that i feel doubt what i ask myself is jack port please dad barthwick circulating the decanter in religious imitation of the rising and setting of the sun i ask myself whether we are sufficiently careful in making inquiries about people before we engage them especially as regards moral conduct jack pass theport please mother mrs barthwick passing it my dear boy are nt you drinking too much jack fills his glass marlow entering detective snow to see you sir barthwick uneasily ah say ill be with him in a minute mrs barthwick without turning let him come in here marlow snow enters in an overcoat his bowler hat in hand barthwick halfrising oh good evening snow good evening sir good evening maam i ve called round to report what i ve done rather late i m afraid another case took me away he takes the silver box out o f his pocket causing a sensation in the barthwick family this is the identical article i believe barthwick certainly certainly snow havin your crest and cypher as you described to me sir i d no hesitation in the matter barthwick excellent will you have a glass of he glances at the waning port er sherrypours out sherry jack just give mr snow this jack rises and gives the glass to snow then lolling in his chair regards him indolently snow drinking off wine and putting down the glass after seeing you i went round to this womans lodgings sir its a low neighborhood and i thought it as well to place a constable below and not without e was wanted as things turned out barthwick indeed snow yes sir i ad some trouble i asked her to account for the presence of the article she could give me no answer except to deny the theft so i took her into custody then her husband came for me so i was obliged to take him too for assault he was very violent on the way to the station very violent threatened you and your son and altogether he was a handful i can till you mrs barthwick what a ruffian he must be snow yes maam a rough customer jack sipping his mine bemused punch the beggars head snow given to drink as i understand sir mrs barthwick its to be hoped he will get a severe punishment snow the odd thing is sir that he persists in sayin he took the box himself barthwick took the box himself he smiles what does he think to gain by that snow he says the young gentleman was intoxicated last night jack stops the cracking of a nut and looks at snow barthwick losing his smile has put his wineglass down there is a silence snow looking from face to face remarks took him into the house and gave him whisky and under the influence of an empty stomach the man says he took the box mrs barthwick the impudent wretch barthwick d you mean that he er intends to put this forward tomorrow snow thatll be his line sir but whether hes endeavouring to shield his wife or whether he looks at jack theres something in it will be for the magistrate to say mrs barthwick haughtily something in what i dont understand you as if my son would bring a man like that into the house barthwick from the fireplace with an effort to be calm my son can speak for himself no doubt well jack what do you say mrs barthwick sharply what does he say why of course he says the whole storys stuff jack embarrassed well of course i of course i dont know anything about it mrs barthwick i should think not indeed to snow the man is an audacious ruffian barthwick suppressing jumps but in view of my sons saying theres nothing in this this fable will it be necessary to proceed against the man under the circumstances snow we shall have to charge him with the assault sir it would be as well for your son to come down to the court therell be a remand no doubt the queer thing is there was quite a sum of money found on him and a crimson silk purse barthwick starts jack rises and sits dozen again i suppose the lady has nt missed her purse barthwick hastily oh no oh no jack no mrs barthwick dreamily no to snow i ve been inquiring of the servants this man does hang about the house i shall feel much safer if he gets a good long sentence i do think we ought to be protected against such ruffians barthwick yes yes of course on principle but in this case we have a number of things to think of to snow i suppose as you say the man must be charged eh snow no question about that sir barthwick staring gloomily at jack this prosecution goes very much against the grain with me i have great sympathy with the poor in my position i m bound to recognise the distress there is amongst them the condition of the people leaves much to be desired d you follow me i wish i could see my way to drop it mrs barthwick sharply john its simply not fair to other people its putting property at the mercy of any one who likes to take it barthwick trying to make signs to her aside i m not defending him not at all im trying to look at the matter broadly mrs barthwick nonsense john theres a time for everything snow rather sardonically i might point out sir that to withdraw the charge of stealing would not make much difference because the facts must come out he looks significantly at jack in reference to the assault and as i said that charge will have to go forward barthwick hastily yes oh exactly its entirely on the womans account entirely a matter of my own private feelings snow if i were you sir i should let things take their course its not likely therell be much difficulty these things are very quick settled barthwick doubtfully you think so you think so jack rousing himself i say what shall i have to swear to snow thats best known to yourself sir retreating to the door better employ a solicitor sir in case anything should arise we shall have the butler to prove the loss of the article youll excuse me going i m rather pressed tonight the case may come on any time after eleven good evening sir good evening maam i shall have to produce the box in court tomorrow so if youll excuse me sir i may as well take it with me he takes the silver box and leaves them with a little bow barthwick makes a move to follow him then dashing his hands beneath his coat tails speaks with desperation barthwick i do wish youd leave me to manage things myself you will put your nose into matters you know nothing of a pretty mess youve made of this mrs barthwick coldly i dont in the least know what youre talking about if you cant stand up for your rights i can i ve no patience with your principles its such nonsense barthwick principles good heavens what have principles to do with it for goodness sake dont you know that jack was drunk last night jack dad mrs barthwick in horror rising jack jack look here mother i had supper everybody does i mean to say you know what i mean its absurd to call it being drunk at oxford everybody gets a bit on sometimes mrs barthwick well i think its most dreadful if that is really what you do at oxford jack angrily well why did you send me there one must do as other fellows do its such nonsense i mean to call it being drunk of course i m awfully sorry i ve had such a beastly headache all day barthwick tcha if youd only had the common decency to remember what happened when you came in then we should know what truth there was in what this fellow says as it is its all the most confounded darkness jack staring as though at halfformed visions i just get a and then it s gone mrs barthwick oh jack do you mean to say you were so tipsy you cant even remember jack look here mother of course i remember i came i must have come barthwick unguardedly and walking up and down tcha and that infernal purse good heavens itll get into the papers who on earth could have foreseen a thing like this better to have lost a dozen cigaretteboxes and said nothing about it to his wife its all your doing i told you so from the first i wish to goodness roper would come mrs barthwick sharply i dont know what youre talking about john barthwick turning on her no you you you dont know anything sharply where the devil is roper if he can see a way out of this hes a better man than i take him for i defy any one to see a way out of it i cant jack look here dont excite dad i can simply say i was too beastly tired and dont remember anything except that i came in and in a dying voice went to bed the same as usual barthwick went to bed who knows where you went i ve lost all confidence for all i know you slept on the floor jack indignantly i did nt i slept on the barthwick sitting on the sofa who cares where you slept what does it matter if he mentions the the a perfect disgrace mrs barthwick what a silence i insist on knowing jack oh

jack well it was somebody elses it was all a joke i did nt want the beastly thing mrs barthwick do you mean that you had another persons purse and that this man took it too barthwick tcha of course he took it too a man like that jones will make the most of it itll get into the papers mrs barthwick i dont understand what on earth is all the fuss about bending over jack and softly jack now tell me

desperate and rising voice a woman mrs barthwick a woman oh jack no jack jumping up you would have it i did nt want to tell you its not my fault the door opens and marlow ushers in a man of middle age inclined to corpulence in evening dress he has a ruddy thin moustache and dark quickmoving little eyes his eyebrows aye chinese marlow mr roper sir he leaves the room roper with a quick look round how do you do but neither jack nor mrs barthwick make a sign barthwick hurrying thank goodness youve come roper you remember what i told you this afternoon weve just had the detective here roper got the box barthwick yes yes but look here it was nt the charwoman at all her drunken loafer of a husband took the things he says that fellow there he waves his hand at jack who with his shoulder raised seems trying to ward off a blow let him into the house last night can you imagine such a thing roper laughs barthwick with excited emphasis its no laughing matter roper i told you about that business of jacks too dont you see the brute took both the things took that infernal purse itll get into the papers roper raising his eyebrows hm the purse depravity in high life what does your son say barthwick he remembers nothing d n did you ever see such a mess it ll get into the papers mrs barthwick with her hand across hey eyes oh its not that barthwick and roper turn and look at her barthwick its the idea of that woman shes just heard roper nods and mrs barthwick setting her lips gives a slow look at jack and sits down at the table what on earths to be done roper a ruffian like this jones will make all the capital he can out of that purse mrs barthwick i dont believe that jack took that purse barthwick what when the woman came here for it this morning mrs barthwick here she had the impudence why was nt i told she looks round from face to face no one answers hey there is a pause barthwick suddenly whats to be done roper roper quietly to jack i suppose you did nt leave your latch

profession and i have three little children dependent on me magistrate protruding his neck yes yes but what did he say to you mrs jones i asked him whatever came over him to do such a thing and he said it was the drink he said he had had too much to drink and something came over him and of course your worship he had had very little to eat all day and the drink does go to the head when you have not had enough to eat your worship may not know but it is the truth and i would like to say that all through his married life i have never known him to do such a thing before though we have passed through great hardships and speaking with soft emphasis i am quite sure he would not have done it if he had been himself at the time magistrate yes yes but dont you know that that is no excuse mrs jones yes your worship i know that it is no excuse the magistrate leans over and parleys with his clerk jack leaning over from his seat behind i say dad barthwick tsst sheltering his mouth he speaks

case as one of disorder only on the part of bald constable hssshh roper shakes his head magistrate now supposing what you say and what your husband says is true what i have to consider is how did he obtain access to this house and were you in any way a party to his obtaining access you are the charwoman employed at the house mrs jones yes your worship and of course if i had let him into the house it would have been very wrong of me and i have never done such a thing in any of the houses where i have been employed magistrate well so you say now let us hear what story the male prisoner makes of

the blind jones violently ive done no more than wot he as im a poor man ive got no money an no friends he s a toff he can do wot i cant magistrate now now all this wont help you you must be quiet you say you took this box now what made you take it were you pressed for money jones im always pressed for money magistrate was that the reason you took it jones no magistrate to snow was anything found

magistrate staring at the purse yes yes let me see there is a silence no no i ve nothing before me as to the purse how did you come by all that money jones after a long pause suddenly i declines to say magistrate but if you had all that money what made you take this box jones i took it out of spite magistrate hissing with protruded neck you took it out of spite well now thats something but do

everything jones pointing at jack you ask im wot made im take the roper quietly does your worship require this witness in the box any longer magistrate ironically i think not he is hardly profitable jack leaves the witnessbox and hanging his head resumes his seat jones you ask im wot made im take the ladys but the bald constable catches him by the sleeve bald constable sssh magistrate emphatically now listen to me i ve nothing to do with what he may or may not have taken why did you resist the police in the execution of their duty jones it war nt their duty to take my wife a

of disorder jones i dont want it smothered up i want it all dealt with fair i want my rights magistrate rapping his desk now you have said all you have to say and you will be quiet there is a silence the magistrate bends over and parleys with his clerk yes i think i may discharge the woman in a kindly voice he addresses mrs jones who stands unmoving with her hands crossed on the rail it is very unfortunate for you that this man has behaved as he has it is not the consequences to him but the consequences to you you have been brought here twice you have lost your work he glares at jones and

pause you have pleaded guilty to stealing this box jones not to stealin bald constable hssshh magistrate and to assaulting the police jones any man as was a man magistrate your conduct here has been most improper you give the excuse that you were drunk when you stole the box i tell you that is no excuse if you choose to get drunk and break the law afterwards you must take the consequences and let

hoarse and whispering groan magistrate we will now adjourn for lunch he rises from his seat the court is in a stir roper gets up and speaks to the reporter jack throwing up his head walks with a swagger to the corridor barthwick follows mrs jones turning to him zenith a humble gesture oh sir barthwick hesitates then yielding to his nerves he makes a shamefaced gesture of refusal and hurries

tree followed by mrs hope he enters mrs hope speaking into the tree not there colonel from within well where then mrs hope why up oh gracious mrs gwyn standing alone is smiling lever approaches from the towingpath he is a man like a fencers wrist supple and steely a man whose age is difficult to tell with a quick goodlooking face and a line between his brows his darkish hair is flecked with grey he gives the feeling that he has always had to spurt to keep pace with his own life mrs hope also entering the hollow tree nooh colonel from the depths in a high voice well dash it then what do you want mrs gwyn peachey may i introduce mr lever to you miss beech my old governess they shake each other by the hand lever how do you do his voice is pleasant his manner easy miss beech pleased to meet

convulsively they are very hot lever and mrs gwyn are very cool mrs hope shaking hands with him so you ve got here are nt you very hot tom colonel brought a splendid day with you splendid as he speaks joy comes running with a bunch of roses seeing lever she stops and stands quite rigid miss beech sitting in the swing thunder colonel thunder nonsense peachey youre always imagining something look at

lever how are you joy have nt seen you for an age joy without expression i am very well thank you she raises her hand and just touches his mrs gwyns eyes are fixed on her daughter miss beech is watching them intently mrs hope is buttoning the colonels coat the curtain falls act ii it is afternoon and at a gardentable placed beneath the hollow tree the colonel is poring over plans astride of a garden chair lever is smoking cigarettes dick is hanging chinese lanterns to the hollow tree lever of course if this level pointing with his cigarette peters out to the west we shall be in a tightish place you know what a mine is at this stage colonel hope colonel absently yes yes tracing a line what is there to prevent its running out here to the east lever well nothing except that as a matter of fact it doesnt colonel with some excitement im very glad you showed me these papers very glad i say that its a most astonishing thing if the ore suddenly stops there a gleam of humour visits levers face im not an expert but you ought to prove that ground to the east more thoroughly lever quizzically of course sir if you advise that colonel if it were mine id no more sit down under the belief that the ore stopped there than i d theres a harmony in these things never i can only tell you what our experts say colonel ah experts no faith in them never had miners lawyers theologians cowardly lot pays them to be cowardly when they have nt their own axes to grind theyve got their theories a theorys a dangerous thing he loses himself in contemplation of the papers now my theory is you re in strata here of what we call the triassic age lever smiling faintly ah colonel youve struck a fault thats whats happened the ore may be as much as thirty or forty yards out but it s there depend on it lever would you back that opinion sir colonel with dignity i never give an opinion that im not prepared to back i want to get to the bottom of this whats to prevent the gold going down indefinitely lever nothing so far as i know colonel with suspicion eh lever all i can tell you is this is as far as weve got and we want more money before we can get any farther colonel absently yes yes thats very usual lever if you ask my personal opinion i think its very doubtful that the gold does go down colonel smiling oh a personal opinion a matter of this sort lever as though about to take the papers perhaps wed better close the sitting sir sorry to have bored you colonel now now dont be so touchy if im to put money in im bound to look at it all round lever with lifted brows please dont imagine that i want you to put money in colonel confound it sir d you suppose i take you for a company promoter lever thank you colonel looking at him doubtfully youve got irish blood in you um youre so hasty lever if you re really thinking of taking shares my advice to you is dont colonel regretfully if this were an ordinary gold mine i wouldnt dream of looking at it i want you to understand that nobody has a greater objection to gold mines than i lever looks down at his host with halfclosed eyes but it is a gold mine colonel hope colonel i know i know but i ve been into it for myself ive formed my opinion personally now what s the reason you dont want me to invest lever well if it doesnt turn out as you expect youll say its my doing i know what investors are colonel dubiously if it were a westralian or a kaffir i would nt touch it with a pair of tongs it s not as if i were going to put much in he suddenly bends above the papers as though magnetically attracted i like these triassic formations dick who has hung the last lantern moodily departs lever looking after him that young man seems depressed colonel as though remembering his principles i dont like mines never have suddenly absorbed again i tell you what lever this things got tremendous possibilities you dont seem to believe in it enough no mines any good without faith until i see for myself however i shant commit myself beyond a thousand lever are you serious sir colonel certainly ive been thinking it over ever since you told me henty had fought shy i ve a poor opinion of henty hes one of those fellows that says one thing and does another an opportunist lever slowly im afraid were all that more or less he sits beneath the hollow tree colonel a man never knows what he is himself there s my wife she thinks she sby the way dont say anything to her about this please and lever nervously i dont think you know this is quite the sort of thing for my niece lever quietly i agree i mean to get her out of it colonel a little taken aback ah you know she shes in a very delicate position living by herself in london lever looks at him ironically you very nervously see a good deal of her if it had nt been for joy growing so fast we shouldnt have had the child down here her mother ought to have her with her eh dont you think so lever forcing a smile mrs gwyn always seems to me to get on all right colonel as though making a discovery you know ive found that when a womans living alone and unprotected the very least thing will set a lot of hags and jackanapes talking hotly the more unprotected and helpless a woman is the more they revel in it if theres anything i hate in this world its those wretched creatures who babble about their neighbours affairs lever i agree with you colonel one ought to be very careful not to give them that is checks himself confused then hurrying on i suppose you and joy get on all right lever coolly pretty well thanks im not exactly in joys line have nt seen very much of her in fact miss beech and joy have been approaching from the house but seeing lever joy turns abruptly hesitates a moment and with an angry gesture goes away colonel unconscious wonderfully affectionate little thing well shell be going home tomorrow miss beech who has been gazing after joy talkin business poor creatures lever oh no if youll excuse me ill wash my hands before tea he glances at the colonel poring over papers and shrugging his shoulders strolls away miss beech sitting in the swing i see your horrid papers colonel be quiet peachey miss beech on a beautiful summers day too colonel thatll do now miss beech unmoved for every ounce you take out of a gold mine you put two in colonel who told you that rubbish miss beech with devilry you did colonel this is nt

playing the game to put molly into a thing like that colonel what do you mean sir ernest any juggins can see that shes a bit gone on our friend colonel freezingly indeed ernest hes not at all the sort of johnny that appeals to me colonel really ernest unmoved if i were you colonel i should tip her the wink he was hanging about her at ascot all the time it s a bit thick mrs hope followed by rose appears from the house colonel stammering with passion jackanapes mrs hope dont stand there tom clear those papers and let rose lay the table now ernest go and get another chair the colonel looks wildly round and sits beneath the hollow tree with his head held in his hands rose lays the cloth mrs beech sitting beside the colonel poor creature ernest carrying his chair about with him ask any

hes a very nice fellow and i want you to pump him well tom and see what there is in this mine colonel uneasily pump mrs hope looking at him curiously yes you ve been up to something now what is it

eavesdropping pump mrs hope well what were you looking at these papers for it does drive me so wild the way you throw away all the chances you have of making a little money ive got you this

s go and dance they go for a few seconds the hollow tree stands alone then from the house rose comes and enters it she takes out a bottle of champagne wipes it and carries it away but seeing mrs gwyns scarf lying across the chair she fingers it and stops listening to the waltz suddenly draping it round her shoulders she seizes the bottle of champagne and waltzes with abandon to the music as though avenging a long starvation of her instincts thus dancing she is surprised by dick who has come to smoke a cigarette and think at the spot where he was told to have a go rose startled stops and hugs the bottle dick its not claret rose i should nt warm it rose taking off the scarf replaces it on the chair then with the halfwarmed bottle she retreats dick in the swing sits thinking of his fate

mr underwood scantlebury these fireplaces of yours underwood underwood roused from studying some papers a screen rather im sorry he goes to the door with a little smile were not accustomed to complaints of too much fire down here just now he speaks as though he holds a pipe between his teeth slowly ironically wilder in an injured voice you mean the men hm underwood goes out scantlebury poor devils wilder its their own fault scantlebury edgar holding out his paper theres great distress among them according to the trenartha news wilder oh that rag give it to wanklin suit his radical views they call us monsters i suppose the editor of that rubbish ought to be shot edgar reading if the board of worthy gentlemen who control the trenartha tin plate works from their armchairs in london would condescend to come and see for themselves the conditions prevailing amongst their workpeople during this strike wilder well we have come edgar continuing we cannot believe that even their legof mutton hearts would remain untouched wanklin takes the paper from him wilder ruffian i remember that fellow when he had nt a penny to his name little snivel of a chap thats made his way by black guarding everybody who takes a different view to himself anthony says something that is not heard wilder what does your father say edgar he says the kettle and the pot wilder hm he sits down next to scantlebury scantlebury blowing out his cheeks i shall boil if i dont get that screen underwood and enid enter with a screen which they place before the fire enid is tall she has a small decided face and is twentyeight years old enid put it closer frank will that do mr wilder its the highest weve got wilder thanks capitally scantlebury turning with a sigh of pleasure ah merci madame enid is there anything else you want father anthony shakes his head edgar anything edgar you might give me a j nib old girl enid there are some down there by mr scantlebury scantlebury handing a little box of nibs ah your brother uses js what does the manager use with expansive politeness what does your husband use mrs underwood underwood a quill scantlebury the homely product of the goose he holds out quills underwood drily thanks if you can spare me one he takes a quill what about lunch enid enid stopping at the doubledoors and looking back were going to have lunch here in the drawingroom so you need nt hurry with your meeting wanklin and wilder bow and she goes out scantlebury rousing himself suddenly ah lunch that hotel dreadful did you try the whitebait last night fried fat wilder past twelve are nt you going to read the minutes tench tench looking for the chairmans assent reads in a rapid and monotonous voice at a board meeting held the st of january at the companys offices cannon street ec

the purpose of discussing the situation with mr simon harness and the mens committee on the spot passed twelve transfers signed and sealed nine certificates and one balance certificate he pushes the book over to the chairman anthony with a heavy sigh if its your pleasure sign the same he signs moving the pen with difficulty wanklin whats the unions game tench they have nt made up their split with the men what does harness want this interview for tench hoping we shall come to a compromise i think sir hes having a meeting with the men this afternoon wilder harness ah hes one of those coldblooded coolheaded chaps i distrust them i dont know that we didnt make a mistake to come down what timell the men be here underwood any time now wilder well if were not ready theyll have to wait wont do them any harm to cool their heels a bit scantlebury slowly poor devils its snowing what weather underwood with meaning slowness this housell be the warmest place theyve been in this winter wilder well i hope were going to settle this business in time for me to catch the ive got to take my wife to spain tomorrow chattily my old father had a strike at his works in just such a february as this they wanted to shoot him wanklin what in the close season wilder by george there was no close season for employers then he used to go down to his office with a pistol in his pocket scantlebury faintly alarmed not seriously wilder with finality ended in his shootin one of em in the legs scantlebury unavoidably feeling his thigh no which anthony lifting the agenda paper to consider the policy of the board in relation to the strike there is a silence wilder its this infernal threecornered duel the union the men and ourselves wanklin we need nt consider the union wilder its my experience that youve always got to consider the union confound them if the union were going to withdraw their support from the men as theyve done why did they ever allow them to strike at all edgar weve had that over a dozen times wilder well ive never understood it its beyond me they talk of the engineers and furnacemens demands being excessive so they are but thats not enough to make the union withdraw their support whats behind it underwood fear of strikes at harpers and tinewells wilder with triumph afraid of other strikes now thats a reason why could nt we have been told that before underwood you were tench you were absent from the board that day sir scantlebury the men must have seen they had no chance when the union gave them up its madness underwood its roberts wilder just our luck the men finding a fanatical firebrand like roberts for leader a pause wanklin looking at anthony well wilder breaking in fussily its a regular mess i dont like the position were in i dont like it ive said so for a long time looking at wanklin when wanklin and i came down here before christmas it looked as if the men must collapse you thought so too underwood underwood yes wilder well they havent here we are going from bad to worse losing our customers shares going down scantlebury shaking his head mm mm wanklin what loss have we made by this strike tench tench over fifty thousand sir scantlebury pained you dont say wilder we shall never got it back tench no sir wilder whod have supposed the men were going to stick out like this nobody suggested that looking angrily at tench scantlebury shaking his head ive never liked a fight never shall anthony no surrender all look at him wilder who wants to surrender anthony looks at him i i want to act reasonably when the men sent roberts up to the board in december then was the time we ought to have humoured him instead of that the chairman dropping his eyes before anthonys er we snapped his head off we could have got them in then by a little tact anthony no compromise wilder there we are this strikes been going on now since october and as far as i can see it may last another six months pretty mess we shall be in by then the only comfort is the menll be in a worse edgar to underwood what sort of state are they really in frank underwood without expression damnable wilder well who on earth would have thought theyd have held on like this without support underwood those who know them wilder i defy any one to know them and what about tin price going up daily when we do get started we shall have to work off our contracts at the top of the market wanklin what do you say to that chairman anthony cant be helped wilder shant pay a dividend till goodness knows when scantlebury with emphasis we ought to think of the shareholders turning heavily chairman i say we ought to think of the shareholders anthony mutters scantlebury whats that tench the chairman says he is thinking of you sir scantlebury sinking back into torpor cynic wilder its past a joke i dont want to go without a dividend for years if the chairman does we cant go on playing ducks and drakes with the companys prosperity edgar rather ashamedly i think we ought to consider the men all but anthony fidget in their seats scantlebury with a sigh we must nt think of our private feelings young man thatll never do edgar ironically im not thinking of our feelings im thinking of the mens wilder as to that were men of business wanklin that is the little trouble edgar theres no necessity for pushing things so far in the face of all this suffering its its cruel no one speaks as though edgar had uncovered something whose existence no man prizing his selfrespect could afford to recognise wanklin with an ironical smile im afraid we must nt base our policy on luxuries like sentiment edgar i detest this state of things anthony we did nt seek the quarrel edgar i know that sir but surely weve gone far enough anthony no all look at one another wanklin luxuries apart chairman we must look out what were doing anthony give way to the men once and therell be no end to it wanklin i quite agree but anthony shakes his head you make it a question of bedrock principle anthony nods luxuries again chairman the shares are below par wilder yes and theyll drop to a half when we pass the next dividend scantlebury with alarm come come not so bad as that wilder grimly youll see craning forward to catch anthonys speech i didnt catch tench hesitating the chairman says sir fais que que devra edgar sharply my father says do what we ought and let things rip wilder tcha scantlebury throwing up his hands the chairmans a stoic i always said the chairman was a stoic wilder much good thatll do us wanklin suavely seriously chairman are you going to let the ship sink under you for the sake of a principle anthony she wont sink scantlebury with alarm not while im on the board i hope anthony with a twinkle better rat scantlebury scantlebury what a man anthony ive always fought them ive never been beaten yet wanklin were with you in theory chairman but were not all made of castiron anthony weve only to hold on wilder rising and going to the fire and go to the devil as fast as we can anthony better go to the devil than give in wilder fretfully that may suit you sir but it does nt suit me or any one else i should think anthony looks him in the facea silence edgar i dont see how we can get over it that to go on like this means starvation to the mens wives and families wilder turns abruptly to the fire and scantlebury puts out a hand to push the idea away wanklin im afraid again that sounds a little sentimental edgar men of business are excused from decency you think wilder nobodys more sorry for the men than i am but if they lashing himself choose to be such a pigheaded lot its nothing to do with us weve quite enough on our hands to think of ourselves and the shareholders edgar irritably it wont kill the shareholders to miss a dividend or two i dont see that thats reason enough for knuckling under scantlebury with grave discomfort you talk very lightly of your dividends young man i dont know where we are wilder theres only one sound way of looking at it we cant go on ruining ourselves with this strike anthony no caving in scantlebury with a gesture of despair look at him anthonys leaning back in his chair they do look at him wilder returning to his seat well all i can say is if thats the chairmans view i dont know what weve come down here for anthony to tell the men that weve got nothing for them grimly they wont believe it till they hear it spoken in plain english wilder hm shouldnt be a bit surprised if that brute roberts had nt got us down here with the very same idea i hate a man with a grievance edgar resentfully we didnt pay him enough for his discovery i always said that at the time wilder we paid him five hundred and a bonus of two hundred three years later if thats not enough what does he want for goodness sake tench complainingly company made a hundred thousand out of his brains and paid him seven hundred thats the way he goes on sir wilder the mans a rank agitator look here i hate the unions but now weve got harness here lets get him to settle the whole thing anthony no again they look at him underwood roberts wont let the men assent to that scantlebury fanatic fanatic wilder looking at anthony and not the only one frost enters from the hall frost to anthony mr harness from the union waiting sir the men are here too sir anthony nods underwood goes to the door returning with harness a pale cleanshaven man with hollow cheeks quick eyes and lantern jaw frost has retired underwood pointing to tenchs chair sit there next the chairman harness wont you at harnesss appearance the board have drawn together as it were and turned a little to him like cattle at a dog harness with a sharp look round and a bow thanks he sits his accent is slightly nasal well gentlemen were going to do business at last i hope wilder depends on what you call business harness why dont you make the men come in harness sardonically the men are far more in the right than you are the question with us is whether we shant begin to support them again he ignores them all except anthony to whom he turns in speaking anthony support them if you like well put in free labour and have done with it harness that wont do mr anthony you cant get free labour and you know it anthony we shall see that harness im quite frank with you we were forced to withhold our support from your men because some of their demands are in excess of current rates i expect to make them withdraw those demands today if they do take it straight from me gentlemen we shall back them again at once now i want to see something fixed upon before i go back tonight cant we have done with this oldfashioned tugofwar business what goods it doing you why dont you recognise once for all that these people are men like yourselves and want whats good for them just as you want whats good for you bitterly your motorcars and champagne and eightcourse dinners anthony if the men will come in well do something for them harness ironically is that your opinion too sir and yours and yours the directors do not answer well all i can say is its a kind of high and mighty aristocratic tone i thought wed grown out of seems i was mistaken anthony its the tone the men use remains to be seen which can hold out longest they without us or we without them harness as business men i wonder youre not ashamed of this waste of force gentlemen you know what itll all end in anthony what harness compromise it always does scantlebury cant you persuade the men that their interests are the same as ours harness turning ironically i could persuade them of that sir if they were wilder come harness youre a clever man you dont believe all the socialistic claptrap thats talked nowadays there s no real difference between their interests and ours harness theres just one very simple question id like to put to you will you pay your men one penny more than they force you to pay them wilder is silent wanklin chiming in i humbly thought that not to pay more than was necessary was the a b c of commerce harness with irony yes that seems to be the a b c of commerce sir and the a b c of commerce is between your interests and the mens scantlebury whispering we ought to arrange something harness drily am i to understand then gentlemen that your board is going to make no concessions wanklin and wilder bend forward as if to speak but stop anthony nodding none wanklin and wilder again bend forward and scantlebury gives an unexpected grunt harness you were about to say something i believe but scantlebury says nothing edgar looking up suddenly were sorry for the state of the men harness icily the men have no use for your pity sir what they want is justice anthony then let them be just harness for that word just read humble mr anthony why should they be humble barring the accident of money are nt they as good men as you anthony cant harness well ive been five years in america it colours a mans notions scantlebury suddenly as though avenging his uncompleted grunt lets have the men in and hear what theyve got to say anthony nods and underwood goes out by the single door harness drily as im to have an interview with them this afternoon gentlemen i ll ask you to postpone your final decision till thats over again anthony nods and taking up his glass drinks underwood comes in again followed by roberts green bulgin thomas rous they file in hat in hand and stand silent in a row roberts is lean of middle height with a slight stoop he has a little ratgnawn browngrey beard moustaches high cheekbones hollow cheeks small fiery eyes he wears an old and greasestained blue serge suit and carries an old bowler hat he stands nearest the chairman green next to him has a clean worn face with a small grey goatee beard and drooping moustaches iron spectacles and mild straightforward eyes he wears an overcoat green with age and a linen collar next to him is bulgin a tall strong man with a dark moustache and fighting jaw wearing a red muffler who keeps changing his cap from one hand to the other next to him is thomas an old man with a grey moustache full beard and weatherbeaten bony face whose overcoat discloses a lean pluckedlooking neck on his right rous the youngest of the five looks like a soldier he has a glitter in his eyes underwood pointing there are some chairs there against the wall roberts wont you draw them up and sit down roberts thank you mr underwood well stand in the presence of the board he speaks in a biting and staccato voice rolling his rs pronouncing his as like an italian a and his consonants short and crisp how are you mr harness did nt expect t have the pleasure of seeing you till this afternoon harness steadily we shall meet again then roberts roberts glad to hear that we shall have some news for you to take to your people anthony what do the men want roberts acidly beg pardon i dont quite catch the chairmans remark tench from behind the chairmans chair the chairman wishes to know what the men have to say roberts its what the board has to say weve come to hear its for the board to speak first anthony the board has nothing to say roberts looking along the line of men in that case were wasting the directors time well be taking our feet off this pretty carpet he turns the men move slowly as though hypnotically influenced wanklin suavely come roberts you did nt give us this long cold journey for the pleasure of saying that thomas a pure welshman no sir an what i say iss robertsbitingly go on henry thomas go on you re better able to speak to the directors than me thomas is silent tench the chairman means roberts that it was the men who asked for the conference the board wish to hear what they have to say roberts gad if i was to begin to tell ye all they have to say i wouldnt be finished today and thered be some thatd wish theyd never left their london palaces harness whats your proposition man be reasonable roberts you want reason mr harness take a look round this afternoon before the meeting he looks at the men no sound escapes them youll see some very pretty scenery harness all right my friend you wont put me off roberts to the men we shant put mr harness off have some champagne with your lunch mr harness youll want it sir harness come get to business man thomas what were asking look you is just simple justice roberts venomously justice from london what are you talking about henry thomas have you gone silly thomas is silent we know very well what we are discontented dogs never satisfied what did the chairman tell me up in london that i did nt know what i was talking about i was a foolish uneducated man that knew nothing of the wants of the men i spoke for edgar do please keep to the point anthony holding up his hand there can only be one master roberts roberts then be gad itll be us there is a silence anthony and roberts stare at one another underwood if youve nothing to say to the directors roberts perhaps you ll let green or thomas speak for the men green and thomas look anxiously at roberts at each other and the other men green an englishman if id been listened to gentlemen thomas what ife got to say iss what wefe all got to say roberts speak for yourself henry thomas scantlebury with a gesture of deep spiritual discomfort let the poor men call their souls their own roberts aye they shall keep their souls for its not much body that youve left them mr with biting emphasis as though the word were an offence scantlebury to the men well will you speak or shall i speak for you rous suddenly speak out roberts or leave it to others roberts ironically thank you george rous addressing himself to anthony the chairman and board of directors have honoured us by leaving london and coming all this way to hear what weve got to say it would not be polite to keep them any longer waiting wilder well thank god for that roberts ye will not dare to thank him when i have done mr wilder for all your piety may be your god up in london has no time to listen to the working man im told he is a wealthy god but if he listens to what i tell him he will know more than ever he learned in kensington harness come roberts you have your own god respect the god of other men roberts thats right sir we have another god down here i doubt he is rather different to mr wilders ask henry thomas he will tell you whether his god and mr wilders are the same thomas lifts his hand and cranes his head as though to prophesy wanklin for goodness sake let s keep to the point roberts roberts i rather think it is the point mr wanklin if you can get the god of capital to walk through the streets of labour and pay attention to what he sees youre a brighter man than i take you for for all that youre a radical anthony attend to me roberts roberts is silent you are here to speak for the men as i am here to speak for the board he looks slowly round wilder wanklin and scantlebury make movements of uneasiness and edgar gazes at the floor a faint smile comes on harnesss face now then what is it roberts right sir throughout all that follows he and anthony look fixedly upon each other men and directors show in their various ways suppressed uneasiness as though listening to words that they themselves would not have spoken the men cant afford to travel up to london and they dont trust you to believe what they say in black and white they know what the post is he darts a look at underwood and tench and what directors meetings are refer it to the manager let the manager advise us on the mens condition can we squeeze them a little more underwood in a low voice dont hit below the belt roberts roberts is it below the belt mr underwood the men know when i came up to london i told you the position straight an what came of it i was told i did nt know what i was talkin about i cant afford to travel up to london to be told that again anthony what have you to say for the men roberts i have this to say and first as to their condition ye shall ave no need to go and ask your manager ye cant squeeze them any more every man of us is wellnigh starving a surprised murmur rises from the men roberts looks round ye wonder why i tell ye that every man of us is going short we cant be no worse off than weve been these weeks past ye need nt think that by waiting yell drive us to come in well die first the whole lot of us the men have sent for ye to know once and for all whether ye are going to grant them their demands i see the sheet of paper in the secretarys hand tench moves nervously thats it i think mr tench its not very large tench nodding yes roberts theres not one sentence of writing on that paper that we can do without a movement amongst the men roberts turns on them sharply isnt that so the men assent reluctantly anthony takes from tench the paper and peruses it not one single sentence all those demands are fair we have not asked anything that we are not entitled to ask what i said up in london i say again now there is not anything on that piece of paper that a just man should not ask and a just man give a pause anthony there is not one single demand on this paper that we will grant in the stir that follows on these words roberts watches the directors and anthony the men wilder gets up abruptly and goes over to the fire roberts d ye mean that anthony i do wilder at the fire makes an emphatic movement of disgust roberts noting it with dry intensity ye best know whether the condition of the company is any better than the condition of the men scanning the directors faces ye best know whether ye can afford your tyranny but this i tell ye if ye think the men will give way the least part of an inch yere making the worst mistake ye ever made he fixes his eyes on scantlebury ye think because the union is not supporting us more shame to it that well be coming on our knees to you one fine morning ye think because the men have got their wives an families to think of that its just a question of a week or two anthony it would be better if you did not speculate so much on what we think roberts aye its not much profit to us i will say this for you mr anthony ye know your own mind staying at anthony i can reckon on ye anthony ironically i am obliged to you roberts and i know mine i tell ye this the men will send their wives and families where the country will have to keep them an they will starve sooner than give way i advise ye mr anthony to prepare yourself for the worst that can happen to your company we are not so ignorant as you might suppose we know the way the cat is jumping your position is not all that it might be not exactly anthony be good enough to allow us to judge of our position for ourselves go back and reconsider your own roberts stepping forward mr anthony you are not a young man now from the time i remember anything ye have been an enemy to every man that has come into your works i dont say that yere a mean man or a cruel man but yeve grudged them the say of any word in their own fate yeve fought them down four times ive heard ye say ye love a fight mark my words yere fighting the last fight yell ever fight tench touches robertss sleeve underwood roberts roberts roberts roberts roberts i must nt speak my mind to the chairman but the chairman may speak his mind to me wilder what are things coming to anthony with a grim smile at wilder go on roberts say what you like roberts after a pause i have no more to say anthony the meeting stands adjourned to five oclock wanklin in a low voice to underwood we shall never settle anything like this roberts bitingly we thank the chairman and board of directors for their gracious hearing he moves towards the door the men cluster together stupefied then rous throwing up his head passes roberts and goes out the others follow roberts with his hand on the door maliciously good day gentlemen he goes out harness ironically i congratulate you on the conciliatory spirit thats been displayed with your permission gentlemen ill be with you again at halfpast five good morning he bows slightly rests his eyes on anthony who returns his stare unmoved and followed by underwood goes out there is a moment of uneasy silence underwood reappears in the doorway wilder with emphatic disgust well the doubledoors are opened enid standing in the doorway lunch is ready edgar getting up abruptly walks out past his sister wilder coming to lunch scantlebury scantlebury rising heavily i suppose so i suppose so its the only thing we can do they go out through the doubledoors wanklin in a low voice do you really mean to fight to a finish chairman anthony nods wanklin take care the essence of things is to know when to stop anthony does not answer wanklin very gravely this way disaster lies the ancient trojans were fools to your father mrs underwood he goes out through the doubledoors enid i want to speak to father frank underwood follows wanklin out tench passing round the table is restoring order to the scattered pens and papers enid are nt you coming dad anthony shakes his head enid looks meaningly at tench enid wont you go and have some lunch mr tench tench with papers in his hand thank you maam thank you he goes slowly looking back enid shutting the doors i do hope its settled father anthony no enid very disappointed oh have nt you done anything anthony shakes his head enid frank says they all want to come to a compromise really except that man roberts anthony i dont enid its such a horrid position for us if you were the wife of the manager and lived down here and saw it all you cant realise dad anthony indeed enid we see all the distress you remember my maid annie who married roberts anthony nods its so wretched her hearts weak since the strike

mans life is all a gamble from the time e s born to the time e dies enid leans forward interested mrs roberts goes on with a growing excitement that culminates in the personal feeling of the last words he says mm that when a working mans baby is born its a tossup from breath to breath whether it ever draws another and so on all is life an when he comes to be old its the workhouse or the grave he says that without a man is very near and pinches and stints imself and is children to save there cant be neither surplus nor security thats why he wouldnt have no children she sinks back not though

neither can mr anthony for all that he may say enid at any rate you might have pity on your wife mrs roberts who has her hand pressed to her heart takes it away and tries to calm her breathing roberts madam i have no more to say he takes up the loaf there is a knock at the door and underwood comes in he stands looking at them enid turns to him then seems undecided underwood enid roberts ironically

rous with a furious look sim arness knows what hes talking about give us power to come to terms with london im no orator but i say have done wi this black misery he gives his muter a twist jerks his head back and jumps off the platform the crowd applauds and surges forward amid cries of thats enough up union up harness roberts quietly ascends the platform there is a moment of silence blacksmith we dont want to hear you shut it henry rous get down amid such cries they surge towards the platform evans fiercely let im speak roberts roberts bulgin muttering hed better look out that i dont crack his skull roberts faces the crowd probing them with his eyes till they gradually become silent he begins speaking one of the bargemen rises and stands roberts you dont want to hear me then youll listen to rous and to that old man but not to me youll listen to sim harness of the union thats treated you so fair maybe youll listen to those men from london ah you groan what for you love their feet on your necks dont you then as bulgin elbows his way towards the platform with calm bathos youd like to break my jaw john bulgin let me speak then do your smashing if it gives you pleasure bulgin stands motionless and sullen am i a liar a coward a traitor if only i were yed listen to me im sure the murmurings cease and there is now dead silence is there a man of you here that has less to gain by striking is there a man of you that had more to lose is there a man of you that has given up eight hundred pounds since this trouble here began come now is there how much has thomas given up ten pounds or five or what you listened to him and what had he to say none can pretend he said that im not a believer in principle with biting irony but when nature says no further t es going agenst nature i tell you if a man cannot say to nature budge me from this if ye can with a sort of exaltationhis principles are but his belly oh but thomas says a man can be pure and honest just and merciful and take off his hat to nature i tell you natures neither pure nor honest just nor merciful you chaps that live over the hill an go home dead beat in the dark on a snowy night dont ye fight your way every inch of it do ye go lyin down an trustin to the tender mercies of this merciful nature try it and youll soon know with what yeve got to deal t es only by that he strikes a blow with his clenched fist in natures face that a man can be a man give in says thomas go down on your knees throw up your foolish fight an perhaps he said perhaps your enemy will chuck you down a crust jago never evans curse them thomas i nefer said that roberts bitingly if ye did not say it man ye meant it an what did ye say about chapel chapels against it ye said she s against it well if chapel and nature go hand in hand its the first ive ever heard of it that young man there pointing to rous said i ad ell fire on my tongue if i had i would use it all to scorch and wither this talking of surrender surrendering s the work of cowards and traitors henry rous as george rous moves forward go for him george dont stand his lip roberts flinging out his finger stop there george rous its no time this to settle personal matters rous stops but there was one other spoke to you mr simon harness we have not much to thank mr harness and the union for they said to us desert your mates or well desert you an they did desert us evans they did roberts mr simon harness is a clever man but he has come too late with intense conviction for all that mr simon harness says for all that thomas rous for all that any man present here can say weve won the fight the crowd sags nearer looking eagerly up with withering scorn youve felt the pinch ot in your bellies youve forgotten what that fight as been many times i have told you i will tell you now this once again the fight o the countrys body and blood against a bloodsucker the fight of those that spend themselves with every blow they strike and every breath they draw against a thing that fattens on them and grows and grows by the law of merciful nature that thing is capital a thing that buys the sweat o mens brows and the tortures o their brains at its own price dont i know that wasnt the work o my brains bought for seven hundred pounds and has nt one hundred thousand pounds been gained them by that seven hundred without the stirring of a finger it is a thing that will take as much and give you as little as it can thats capital a thing that will say im very sorry for you poor fellows you have a cruel time of it i know but will not give one sixpence of its dividends to help you have a better time thats capital tell me for all their talk is there one of them that will consent to another penny on the income tax to help the poor thats capital a whitefaced stonyhearted monster ye have got it on its knees are ye to give up at the last minute to save your miserable bodies pain when i went this morning to those old men from london i looked into their very earts one of them was sitting there mr scantlebury a mass of flesh nourished on us sittin there for all the world like the shareholders in this company that sit not moving tongue nor finger takin dividends a great dumb ox that can only be roused when its food is threatened i looked into his eyes and i saw he was afraid afraid for himself and his dividends afraid for his fees afraid of the very shareholders he stands for and all but one of thems afraid like children that get into a wood at night and start at every rustle of the leaves i ask you men he pauses holding out his hand till there is utter silence give me a free hand to tell them go you back to london the men have nothing for you a murmuring give me that an i swear to you within a week you shall have from london all you want evans jago and others a free hand give him a free hand bravo bravo roberts t is not for this little moment of time were fighting the murmuring dies not for ourselves our own little bodies and their wants t is for all those that come after throughout all time with intense sadness oh men for the love o them dont roll up another stone upon their heads dont help to blacken the sky an let the bitter sea in over them theyre welcome to the worst that can happen to me to the worst that can happen to us all are nt they are nt they if we can shake passionately that whitefaced monster with the bloody lips that has sucked the life out of ourselves our wives and children since the world began dropping the note of passion but with the utmost weight and intensity if we have not the hearts of men to stand against it breast to breast and eye to eye and force it backward till it cry for mercy it will go on sucking life and we shall stay forever what we are in almost a whisper less than the very dogs an utter stillness and roberts stands rocking his body slightly with his eyes burning the faces of the crowd evans and jago suddenly roberts the shout is taken up there is a slight movement in the crowd and madge passing below the towingpath stops by the platform looking up at roberts a sudden doubting silence roberts nature says that old man give in to nature i tell you strike your blow in natures face an let it do its worst he catches sight of madge his brows contract he looks away madge in a low voiceclose to the platform your wifes dying roberts glares at her as if torn from some pinnacle of exaltation roberts trying to stammer on i say to you answer them answer them he is drowned by the murmur in the crowd thomas stepping forward tont you hear her then roberts what is it a dead silence thomas your wife man roberts hesitates then with a gesture he leaps down and goes away below the towingpath the men making way for him the standing bargeman opens and prepares to light a lantern daylight is fast failing madge he need nt have hurried annie roberts is dead then in the silence passionately you pack of blinded hounds how many more women are you going to let to die the crowd shrinks back from her and breaks up in groups with a confused uneasy movement madge goes quickly away below the towingpath there is a hush as they look after her lewis theres a spitfire for ye

fists parries the blow and returns it they fight the bargemen are seen holding up the lantern and enjoying the sight old thomas steps forward and holds out his hands thomas shame on your strife the blacksmith brown lewis and the redhaired youth pull evans and bulgin apart the stage is almost dark the curtain falls act iii it is five oclock in the underwoods drawingroom which is artistically furnished enid is sitting on the sofa working at a babys frock edgar by a little spindlelegged table in the centre of the room is fingering a chinabox his eyes are fixed on the doubledoors that lead into the diningroom edgar putting down the chinabox and glancing at his watch just on five theyre all in there waiting except frank wheres he enid hes had to go down to gasgoynes about a contract will you want him edgar he cant help us this is a directors job motioning towards a single door half hidden by a curtain father in his room enid yes edgar i wish hed stay there enid enid looks up at him this is a beastly business old girl he takes up the little box again and turns it over and over enid i went to the robertss this afternoon ted edgar that was nt very wise enid hes simply killing his wife edgar we are you mean enid suddenly roberts ought to give way edgar theres a lot to be said on the mens side enid i dont feel half so sympathetic with them as i did before i went they just set up class feeling against you poor annie was looking dread fully bad fire going out and nothing fit for her to eat edgar walks to and fro but she would stand up for roberts when you see all this wretchedness going on and feel you can do nothing you have to shut your eyes to the whole thing edgar if you can enid when i went i was all on their side but as soon as i got there i began to feel quite different at once people talk about sympathy with the working classes they dont know what it means to try and put it into practice it seems hopeless edgar ah well enid its dreadful going on with the men in this state i do hope the dad will make concessions edgar he wont gloomily its a sort of religion with him curse it i know whats coming hell be voted down enid they would nt dare edgar they will theyre in a funk enid indignantly hed never stand it edgar with a shrug my dear girl if youre beaten in a vote youve got to stand it enid oh she gets up in alarm but would he resign edgar of course it goes to the roots of his beliefs enid but hes so wrapped up in this company ted thered be nothing left for him itd be dreadful edgar shrugs his shoulders oh ted hes so old now you must nt let them edgar hiding his feelings in an outburst my sympathies in this strike are all on the side of the men enid hes been chairman for more than thirty years he made the whole thing and think of the bad times theyve had its always been he who pulled them through oh ted you must edgar what is it you want you said just now you hoped hed make concessions now you want me to back him in not making them this is nt a game enid enid hotly it is nt a game to me that the dads in danger of losing all he cares about in life if he wont give way and hes beaten itll simply break him down edgar did nt you say it was dreadful going on with the men in this state enid but cant you see ted fatherll never get over it you must stop them somehow the others are afraid of him if you back him up edgar putting his hand to his head against my convictions against yours the moment it begins to pinch one personally enid it is nt personal its the dad edgar your family or yourself and over goes the show enid resentfully if you dont take it seriously i do edgar i am as fond of him as you are thats nothing to do with it enid we cant tell about the men its all guesswork but we know the dad might have a stroke any day d you mean to say that he isnt more to you than edgar of course he is enid i dont understand you then edgar hm enid if it were for oneself it would be different but for our own father you dont seem to realise edgar i realise perfectly enid its your first duty to save him edgar i wonder enid imploring oh ted its the only interest hes got left itll be like a deathblow to him edgar restraining his emotion i know enid promise edgar ill do what i can he turns to the doubledoors the curtained door is opened and anthony appears edgar opens the doubledoors and passes through scantleburys voice is faintly heard past five we shall never get through have to eat another dinner at that hotel the doors are shut anthony walks forward anthony youve been seeing roberts i hear enid yes anthony do you know what trying to bridge such a gulf as this is like enid puts her work on the little table and faces him filling a sieve with sand enid dont anthony you think with your gloved hands you can cure the trouble of the century he passes on enid father anthony stops at the double doors im only thinking of you anthony more softly i can take care of myself my dear enid have you thought whatll happen if youre beaten she points in there anthony i dont mean to be enid oh father dont give them a chance youre not well need you go to the meeting at all anthony with a grim smile cut and run enid but theyll outvote you anthony putting his hand on the doors we shall see enid i beg you dad wont you anthony looks at her softly anthony shakes his head he opens the doors a buzz of voices comes in scantlebury can one get dinner on that train up tench no sir i believe not sir wilder well i shall speak out ive had enough of this edgar sharply what it ceases instantly anthony passes through closing the doors behind him enid springs to them with a gesture of dismay she puts her hand on the knob and begins turning it then goes to the fireplace and taps her foot on the fender suddenly she rings the bell frost comes in by the door that leads into the hall frost yes mm enid when the men come frost please show them in here the hall s cold frost i could put them in the pantry mm enid no i dont want to to offend them theyre so touchy frost yes mm pause excuse me mr anthonys ad nothing to eat all day enid i know frost frost nothin but two whiskies and sodas mm enid oh you oughtnt to have let him have those frost gravely mr anthony is a little difficult mm its not as if he were a younger man an knew what was good for im he will have his own way enid i suppose we all want that frost yes mm quietly excuse me speakin about the strike im sure if the other gentlemen were to give up to mr anthony and quietly let the men ave what they want afterwards thatd be the best way i find that very useful with him at times mm enid shakes hey head if hes crossed it makes him violent with an air of discovery and ive noticed in my own case when im violent im always sorry for it afterwards enid with a smile are you ever violent frost frost yes mm oh sometimes very violent enid ive never seen you frost impersonally no mm that is so enid fidgets towards the back of the door with feeling bein with mr anthony as you know mm ever since i was fifteen it worries me to see him crossed like this at his age ive taken the liberty to speak to mr wanklin dropping his voice seems to be the most sensible of the gentlemen but e said to me thats all very well frost but this strikes a very serious thing e said serious for all parties no doubt i said but yumour im sir i said yumour im its like this if a man comes to a stone wall e does nt drive is ead against it e gets over it yes e said youd better tell your master that frost looks at his nails thats where it is mm i said to mr anthony this morning is it worth it sir damn it he said to me frost mind your own business or take a months notice beg pardon mm for using such a word enid moving to the doubledoors and listening do you know that man roberts frost frost yes mm thats to say not to speak to but to look at im you can tell what hes like enid stopping yes frost hes not one of these ere ordinary armless socialists es violent got a fire inside im what i call personal a man may ave what opinions e likes so long as e s not personal when e s that e s not safe enid i think thats what my father feels about roberts frost no doubt mm mr anthony has a feeling against him enid glances at him sharply but finding him in perfect earnest stands biting her lips and looking at the double doors it s a regular right down struggle between the two ive no patience with this roberts from what i ear hes just an ordinary workin man like the rest of em if he did invent a thing hes no worse off than undreds of others my brother invented a new kind o dumbwaiter nobody gave him anything for it an there it is bein used all over the place enid moves closer to the doubledoors theres a kind o man that never forgives the world because e wasnt born a gentleman what i say is no man thats a gentleman looks down on another because e appens to be a class or two above im no more than if e appens to be a class or two below enid with slight impatience yes i know frost of course will you please go in and ask if theyll have some tea say i sent you frost yes mm he opens the doors gently and goes in there is a momentary sound of earnest gather angry talk wilder i dont agree with you wanklin weve had this over a dozen times edgar impatiently well whats the proposition scantlebury yes what does your father say tea not for me not for me wanklin what i understand the chairman to say is this frost reenters closing the door behind him enid moving from the door wont they have any tea frost she goes to the little table and remains motionless looking at the babys frock a parlourmaid enters from the hall parlourmaid a miss thomas mm enid raising her head thomas what miss thomas d you mean a parlourmaid yes mm enid blankly oh where is she parlourmaid in the porch enid i dont wantshe hesitates frost shall i dispose of her mm enid i ll come out no show her in here ellen the parlour maid and frost go out enid pursing her lips sits at the little table taking up the babys frock the parlourmaid ushers in madge thomas and goes out madge stands by the door enid come in what is it what have you come for please madge brought a message from mrs roberts enid a message yes madge she asks you to look after her mother enid i dont understand madge sullenly thats the message enid but what why madge annie roberts is dead there is a silence enid horrified but its only a little more than an hour since i saw her madge of cold and hunger enid rising oh thats not true the poor things heart what makes you look at me like that i tried to help her madge with suppressed savagery i thought youd like to know enid passionately its so unjust cant you see that i want to help you all madge i never harmed any one that had nt harmed me first enid coldly what harm have i done you why do you speak to me like that madge with the bitterest intensity you come out of your comfort to spy on us a week of hunger thats what you want enid standing her ground dont talk nonsense madge i saw her die her hands were blue with the cold enid with a movement of grief oh why wouldnt she let me help her its such senseless pride madge prides better than nothing to keep your body warm enid passionately i wont talk to you how can you tell what i feel its not my fault that i was born better off than you madge we dont want your money enid you dont understand and you dont want to please to go away madge balefully youve killed her for all your soft words you and your father enid with rage and emotion thats wicked my father is suffering himself through this wretched strike madge with sombre triumph then tell him mrs roberts is dead that ll make him better enid go away madge when a person hurts us we get it back on them she makes a sudden and swift movement towards enid fixing her eyes on the childs frock lying across the little table enid snatches the frock up as though it were the child itself they stand a yard apart crossing glances madge pointing to the frock with a little smile ah you felt that lucky its her mother not her children youve to look after is nt it she wont trouble you long enid go away madge ive given you the message she turns and goes out into the hall enid motionless till she has gone sinks down at the table bending her head over the frock which she is still clutching to her the doubledoors are opened and anthony comes slowly in he passes his daughter and lowers himself into an armchair he is very flushed enid hiding her emotionanxiously what is it dad anthony makes a gesture but does not speak who was it anthony does not answer enid going to the doubledoors meets edgar coming in they speak together in low tones what is it ted edgar that fellow wilder taken to personalities he was downright insulting enid what did he say edgar said father was too old and feeble to know what he was doing the dads worth six of him enid of course he is they look at anthony the doors open wider wanklin appears with scantlebury scantlebury sotto voce i dont like the look of this wanklin going forward come chairman wilder sends you his apologies a man cant do more wilder followed by tench comes in and goes to anthony wilder glumly i withdraw my words sir im sorry anthony nods to him enid you have nt come to a decision mr wanklin wanklin shakes his head wanklin were all here chairman what do you say shall we get on with the business or shall we go back to the other room scantlebury yes yes lets get on we must settle something he turns from a small chair and settles himself suddenly in the largest chair with a sigh of comfort wilder and wanklin also sit and tench drawing up a straight backed chair close to his chairman sits on the edge of it with the minutebook and a stylographic pen enid whispering i want to speak to you a minute ted they go out through the doubledoors wanklin really chairman its no use soothing ourselves with a sense of false security if this strikes not brought to an end before the general meeting the shareholders will certainly haul us over the coals scantlebury stirring what whats that wanklin i know it for a fact anthony let them wilder and get turned out wanklin to anthony i dont mind martyrdom for a policy in which i believe but i object to being burnt for some one elses principles scantlebury very reasonable you must see that chairman anthony we owe it to other employers to stand firm wanklin theres a limit to that anthony you were all full of fight at the start scantlebury with a sort of groan we thought the men would give in but theyhave nt anthony they will wilder rising and pacing up and down i cant have my reputation as a man of business destroyed for the satisfaction of starving the men out almost in tears i cant have it how can we meet the shareholders with things in the state they are scantlebury hear hear hear hear wilder lashing himself if any one expects me to say to them ive lost you fifty thousand pounds and sooner than put my pride in my pocket ill lose you another glancing at anthony its its unnatural i dont want to go against you sir wanklin persuasively come chairman we re not free agents were part of a machine our only business is to see the company earns as much profit as it safely can if you blame me for want of principle i say that were trustees reason tells us we shall never get back in the saving of wages what we shall lose if we continue this struggle really chairman we must bring it to an end on the best terms we can make anthony no there is a pause of general dismay wilder its a deadlock then letting his hands drop with a sort of despair now i shall never get off to spain wanklin retaining a trace of irony you hear the consequences of your victory chairman wilder with a burst of feeling my wifes ill scantlebury dear dear you dont say so wilder if i dont get her out of this cold i wont answer for the consequences through the doubledoors edgar comes in looking very grave edgar to his father have you heard this sir mrs roberts is dead every one stages at him as if trying to gauge the importance of this news enid saw her this afternoon she had no coals or food or anything its enough there is a silence every one avoiding the others eyes except anthony who stares hard at his son scantlebury you dont suggest that we could have helped the poor thing wilder flustered the woman was in bad health nobody can say theres any responsibility on us at least not on me edgar hotly i say that we are responsible anthony war is war edgar not on women wanklin it not infrequently happens that women are the greatest sufferers edgar if we knew that all the more responsibility rests on us anthony this is no matter for amateurs edgar call me what you like sir its sickened me we had no right to carry things to such a length wilder i dont like this business a bit that radical rag will twist it to their own ends see if they dont theyll get up some cock and bull story about the poor womans dying from starvation i wash my hands of it edgar you cant none of us can scantlebury striking his fist on the arm of his chair but i protest against this edgar protest as you like mr scantlebury it wont alter facts anthony thats enough edgar facing him angrily no sir i tell you exactly what i think if we pretend the men are not suffering its humbug and if theyre suffering we know enough of human nature to know the women are suffering more and as to the children well its damnable scantlebury rises from his chair i dont say that we meant to be cruel i dont say anything of the sort but i do say its criminal to shut our eyes to the facts we employ these men and we cant get out of it i dont care so much about the men but id sooner resign my position on the board than go on starving women in this way all except anthony are now upon their feet anthony sits grasping the arms of his chair and staring at his son scantlebury i dont i dont like the way youre putting it young sir wanklin youre rather overshooting the mark wilder i should think so indeed edgar losing control its no use blinking things if you want to have the death of women on your hands i dont scantlebury now now young man wilder on our hands not on mine i wont have it edgar we are five members of this board if we were four against it why did we let it drift till it came to this you know perfectly well why because we hoped we should starve the men out well all weve done is to starve one woman out scantlebury almost hysterically i protest i protest im a humane man were all humane men edgar scornfully theres nothing wrong with our humanity its our imaginations mr scantlebury wilder nonsense my imaginations as good as yours edgar if so it is nt good enough wilder i foresaw this edgar then why didnt you put your foot down wilder much good that would have done he looks at anthony edgar if you and i and each one of us here who say that our imaginations are so good scantlebury flurried i never said so edgar paying no attention had put our feet down the thing would have been ended long ago and this poor womans life wouldnt have been crushed out of her like this for all we can tell there may be a dozen other starving women scantlebury for gods sake sir dont use that word at a at a board meeting its its monstrous edgar i will use it mr scantlebury scantlebury then i shall not listen to you i shall not listen its painful to me he covers his ears wanklin none of us are opposed to a settlement except your father edgar im certain that if the shareholders knew wanklin i dont think youll find their imaginations are any better than ours because a woman happens to have a weak heart edgar a struggle like this finds out the weak spots in everybody any child knows that if it hadnt been for this cutthroat policy she need nt have died like this and there would nt be all this misery that any one who is nt a fool can see is going on throughout the foregoing anthony has eyed his son he now moves as though to rise but stops as edgar speaks again i dont defend the men or myself or anybody wanklin you may have to a coroners jury of disinterested sympathisers may say some very nasty things we mustnt lose sight of our position scantlebury without uncovering his ears coroners jury no no its not a case for that edgar i ve had enough of cowardice wanklin cowardice is an unpleasant word mr edgar anthony it will look very like cowardice if we suddenly concede the mens demands when a thing like this happens we must be careful wilder of course we must weve no knowledge of this matter except a rumour the proper course is to put the whole thing into the hands of harness to settle for us thats natural thats what we should have come to any way scantlebury with dignity exactly turning to edgar and as to you young sir i cant sufficiently express my my distaste for the way youve treated the whole matter you ought to withdraw talking of starvation talking of cowardice considering what our views are except your own is is one of goodwill its most irregular its most improper and all i can say is its its given me pain he places his hand over his heart edgar stubbornly i withdraw nothing he is about to say mote when scantlebury once more coveys up his ears tench suddenly makes a demonstration with the minute book a sense of having been engaged in the unusual comes over all of them and one by one they resume their seats edgar alone remains on his feet wilder with an air of trying to wipe something out i pay no attention to what young mr anthony has said coroners jury the ideas preposterous i i move this amendment to the chairmans motion that the dispute be placed at once in the hands of mr simon harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning any one second that tench writes in his book wanklin i do wilder very well then i ask the chairman to put it to the board anthony with a great sighslowly we have been made the subject of an attack looking round at wilder and scantlebury with ironical contempt i take it on my shoulders i am seventysix years old i have been chairman of this company since its inception twoand thirty years ago i have seen it pass through good and evil report my connection with it began in the year that this young man was born edgar bows his head anthony gripping his chair goes on i have had do to with men for fifty years ive always stood up to them i have never been beaten yet i have fought the men of this company four times and four times i have beaten them it has been said that i am not the man i was he looks at wilder however that may be i am man enough to stand to my guns his voice grows stronger the doubledoors are opened enid slips in followed by underwood who restrains her the men have been treated justly they have had fair wages we have always been ready to listen to complaints it has been said that times have changed if they have i have not changed with them neither will i it has been said that masters and men are equal cant there can only be one master in a house where two men meet the better man will rule it has been said that capital and labour have the same interests cant their interests are as wide asunder as the poles it has been said that the board is only part of a machine cant we are the machine its brains and sinews it is for us to lead and to determine what is to be done and to do it without fear or favour fear of the men fear of the shareholders fear of our own shadows before i am like that i hope to die he pauses and meeting his sons eyes goes on there is only one way of treating men with the iron hand this half and half business the half and half manners of this generation has brought all this upon us sentiment and softness and what this young man no doubt would call his social policy you cant eat cake and have it this middleclass sentiment or socialism or whatever it may be is rotten masters are masters men are men yield one demand and they will make it six they are he smiles grimly like oliver twist asking for more if i were in their place i should be the same but i am not in their place mark my words one fine morning when you have given way here and given way there you will find you have parted with the ground beneath your feet and are deep in the bog of bankruptcy and with you floundering in that bog will be the very men you have given way to i have been accused of being a domineering tyrant thinking only of my pride i am thinking of the future of this country threatened with the black waters of confusion threatened with mob government threatened with what i cannot see if by any conduct of mine i help to bring this on us i shall be ashamed to look my fellows in the face anthony stares before him at what he cannot see and there is perfect stillness frost comes in from the hall and all but anthony look round at him uneasily frost to his master the men are here sir anthony makes a gesture of dismissal shall i bring them in sir anthony wait frost goes out anthony turns to face his son i come to the attack that has been made upon me edgar with a gesture of deprecation remains motionless with his head a little bowed a woman has died i am told that her blood is on my hands i am told that on my hands is the starvation and the suffering of other women and of children edgar i said on our hands sir anthony it is the same his voice grows stronger and stronger his feeling is more and more made manifest i am not aware that if my adversary suffer in a fair fight not sought by me it is my fault if i fall under his feet as fall i may i shall not complain that will be my lookout and this is his i cannot separate as i would these men from their women and children a fair fight is a fair fight let them learn to think before they pick a quarrel edgar in a low voice but is it a fair fight father look at them and look at us theyve only this one weapon anthony grimly and youre weakkneed enough to teach them how to use it it seems the fashion nowadays for men to take their enemys side i have not learnt that art is it my fault that they quarrelled with their union too edgar there is such a thing as mercy anthony and justice comes before it edgar what seems just to one man sir is injustice to another anthony with suppressed passion you accuse me of injustice of what amounts to inhumanity of cruelty edgar makes a gesture of horror a general frightened movement wanklin come come chairman anthony in a grim voice these are the words of my own son they are the words of a generation that i dont understand the words of a soft breed a general murmur with a violent effort anthony recovers his control edgar quietly i said it of myself too father a long look is exchanged between them and anthony puts out his hand with a gesture as if to sweep the personalities away then places it against his brow swaying as though from giddiness there is a movement towards him he moves them back anthony before i put this amendment to the board i have one more word to say he looks from face to face if it is carried it means that we shall fail in what we set ourselves to do it means that we shall fail in the duty that we owe to all capital it means that we shall fail in the duty that we owe ourselves it means that we shall be open to constant attack to which we as constantly shall have to yield be under no misapprehension run this time and you will never make a stand again you will have to fly like curs before the whips of your own men if that is the lot you wish for you will vote for this amendment he looks again from face to face finally resting his gaze on edgar all sit with their eyes on the ground anthony makes a gesture and tench hands him the book he reads moved by mr wilder and seconded by mr wanklin that the mens demands be placed at once in the hands of mr simon harness for settlement on the lines indicated by him this morning with sudden vigour those in favour signify the same in the usual way for a minute no one moves then hastily just as anthony is about to speak wilders hand and wanklins are held up then scantleburys and last edgars who does not lift his head anthony lifts his own hand in a clear voice the amendment is carried i resign my position on this board enid gasps and there is dead silence anthony sits motionless his head slowly drooping suddenly he heaves as though the whole of his life had risen up within him contrary fifty years you have disgraced me gentlemen bring in the men he sits motionless staring before him the board draws hurriedly together and forms a group tench in a frightened manner speaks into the hall underwood almost forces enid from the room wilder hurriedly whats to be said to them why isnt harness here ought we to see the men before he comes i dont tench will you come in please enter thomas green bulgin and rous who file up in a row past the little table tench sits down and

until the whole of those demands are yielded anthony looks at him but does not speak there is a movement amongst the men as though they were bewildered harness roberts roberts glancing fiercely at him and back to anthony is that clear enough for ye is it short enough and to the point ye made a mistake to think that we would come to heel ye may break the body but ye cannot break the spirit get back to london the men have nothing for ye pausing uneasily he takes a step towards the unmoving anthony edgar were all sorry for you roberts but roberts keep your sorrow young man let your father speak harness with the sheet of paper in his hand speaking from behind the little table roberts robert to anthony with passionate intensity why dont ye answer harness roberts roberts turning sharply what is it harness gravely youre talking without the book things have travelled past you he makes a sign to tench who beckons the directors they quickly sign his copy of the terms look at this man holding up his sheet of paper demands conceded with the exception of those relating to the engineers and furnacemen double wages for saturdays overtime nightshifts as they are these terms have been agreed the men go back to work again tomorrow the strike is at an end roberts reading the paper and turning on the men they shrink back from him all but rous who stands his ground with deadly stillness ye have

dashes the paper from him and covers up his eyes scantlebury behind his hand to tench look after the chairman hes not well hes not well he had no lunch if theres any fund started for the women and children put me down for for twenty pounds he goes out into the hall in cumbrous haste and wanklin who has been staring at roberts and anthony with twitchings of his face follows edgar remains seated on the sofa looking at the ground tench returning to the bureau writes in his minute book harness stands by the little table gravely watching roberts roberts then youre no longer chairman of this company breaking into halfmad laughter ah haah ha ha theyve thrown ye over thrown over their chairman ahhaha with a sudden dreadful calm so theyve done us both down mr anthony enid hurrying through the doubledoors comes quickly to her father anthony both broken men my friend roberts harness coming down and laying his hands on robertss sleeve for shame roberts go home quietly man go home roberts tearing his arm away home shrinking together in a whisper home enid quietly to her father come away dear come to your room anthony rises with an effort he turns to roberts who looks at him they stand several seconds gazing at each other fixedly anthony lifts his hand as though to salute but lets it fall the expression of robertss face changes from hostility to wonder they bend their heads in token of respect anthony turns and slowly walks towards the curtained door suddenly he sways as though about to fall recovers himself and is assisted out by edgar and enid underwood follows but stops at the door roberts remains motionless for several seconds staring intently after anthony then goes out into the hall tench approaching harness its a great weight off my mind mr harness but what a painful scene sir he wipes his brow harness pale and resolute regards with a grim halfsmile the quavering tench its all been so violent what did he mean by done us both down if he has lost his wife poor fellow he oughtnt to have spoken to the chairman like that harness a woman dead and the two best men both broken tench staring at himsuddenly excited dyou know sir these terms theyre the very same we

door makes a gesture of assent the curtain falls
