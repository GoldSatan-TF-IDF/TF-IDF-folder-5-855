the death of the lion chapter i i had simply i suppose a change of heart and it must have begun when i received my manuscript back from mr pinhorn mr pinhorn was my chief as he was called in the office he had the high mission of bringing the paper up this was a weekly periodical which had been supposed to be almost past redemption when he took hold of it it was mr deedy who had let the thing down so dreadfully he was never mentioned in the office now save in connexion with that misdemeanour young as i was i had been in a manner taken over from mr deedy who had been owner as well as editor forming part of a promiscuous lot mainly plant and officefurniture which poor mrs deedy in her bereavement and depression parted with at a rough valuation i could account for my continuity but on the supposition that i had been cheap i rather resented the practice of fathering all flatness on my late protector who was in his unhonoured grave but as i had my way to make i found matter enough for complacency in being on a staff at the same time i was aware of my exposure to suspicion as a product of the old lowering system this made me feel i was doubly bound to have ideas and had doubtless been at the bottom of my proposing to mr pinhorn that i should lay my lean hands on neil paraday i remember how he looked at me quite to begin with as if he had never heard of this celebrity who indeed at that moment was by no means in the centre of the heavens and even when i had knowingly explained he expressed but little confidence in the demand for any such stuff when i had reminded him that the great principle on which we were supposed to work was just to create the demand we required he considered a moment and then returned i see you want to write him up call it that if you like and whats your inducement bless my soul my admiration mr pinhorn pursed up his mouth is there much to be done with him whatever there is we should have it all to ourselves for he hasnt been touched this argument was effective and mr pinhorn responded very well touch him then he added but where can you do it under the fifth rib mr pinhorn stared wheres that you want me to go down and see him i asked when i had enjoyed his visible search for the obscure suburb i seemed to have named i dont want anything the proposals your own but you must remember that thats the way we do things now said mr pinhorn with another dig mr deedy unregenerate as i was i could read the queer implications of this speech the present owners superior virtue as well as his deeper craft spoke in his reference to the late editor as one of that baser sort who deal in false representations mr deedy would as soon have sent me to call on neil paraday as he would have published a holidaynumber but such scruples presented themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his successor whose own sincerity took the form of ringing doorbells and whose definition of genius was the art of finding people at home it was as if mr deedy had published reports without his young mens having as pinhorn would have said really been there i was unregenerate as i have hinted and couldnt be concerned to straighten out the journalistic morals of my chief feeling them indeed to be an abyss over the edge of which it was better not to peer really to be there this time moreover was a vision that made the idea of writing something subtle about neil paraday only the more inspiring i would be as considerate as even mr deedy could have wished and yet i should be as present as only mr pinhorn could conceive my allusion to the sequestered manner in which mr paraday lived it had formed part of my explanation though i knew of it only by hearsay was i could divine very much what had made mr pinhorn nibble it struck him as inconsistent with the success of his paper that any one should be so sequestered as that and then wasnt an immediate exposure of everything just what the public wanted mr pinhorn effectually called me to order by reminding me of the promptness with which i had met miss braby at liverpool on her return from her fiasco in the states hadnt we published while its freshness and flavour were unimpaired miss brabys own version of that great international episode i felt somewhat uneasy at this lumping of the actress and the author and i confess that after having enlisted mr pinhorns sympathies i procrastinated a little i had succeeded better than i wished and i had as it happened work nearer at hand a few days later i called on lord crouchley and carried off in triumph the most unintelligible statement that had yet appeared of his lordships reasons for his change of front i thus set in motion in the daily papers columns of virtuous verbiage the following week i ran down to brighton for a chat as mr pinhorn called it with mrs bounder who gave me on the subject of her divorce many curious particulars that had not been articulated in court if ever an article flowed from the primal fount it was that article on mrs bounder by this time however i became aware that neil paradays new book was on the point of appearing and that its approach had been the ground of my original appeal to mr pinhorn who was now annoyed with me for having lost so many days he bundled me off we would at least not lose another ive always thought his sudden alertness a remarkable example of the journalistic instinct nothing had occurred since i first spoke to him to create a visible urgency and no enlightenment could possibly have reached him it was a pure case of profession flair he had smelt the coming glory as an animal smells its distant prey chapter ii i may as well say at once that this little record pretends in no degree to be a picture either of my introduction to mr paraday or of certain proximate steps and stages the scheme of my narrative allows no space for these things and in any case a prohibitory sentiment would hang about my recollection of so rare an hour these meagre notes are essentially private so that if they see the light the insidious forces that as my story itself shows make at present for publicity will simply have overmastered my precautions the curtain fell lately enough on the lamentable drama my memory of the day i alighted at mr paradays door is a fresh memory of kindness hospitality compassion and of the wonderful illuminating talk in which the welcome was conveyed some voice of the air had taught me the right moment the moment of his life at which an act of unexpected young allegiance might most come home to him he had recently recovered from a long grave illness i had gone to the neighbouring inn for the night but i spent the evening in his company and he insisted the next day on my sleeping under his roof i hadnt an indefinite leave mr pinhorn supposed us to put our victims through on the gallop it was later in the office that the rude motions of the jig were set to music i fortified myself however as my training had taught me to do by the conviction that nothing could be more advantageous for my article than to be written in the very atmosphere i said nothing to mr paraday about it but in the morning after my remove from the inn while he was occupied in his study as he had notified me he should need to be i committed to paper the main heads of my impression then thinking to commend myself to mr pinhorn by my celerity i walked out and posted my little packet before luncheon once my paper was written i was free to stay on and if it was calculated to divert attention from my levity in so doing i could reflect with satisfaction that i had never been so clever i dont mean to deny of course that i was aware it was much too good for mr pinhorn but i was equally conscious that mr pinhorn had the supreme shrewdness of recognising from time to time the cases in which an article was not too bad only because it was too good there was nothing he loved so much as to print on the right occasion a thing he hated i had begun my visit to the great man on a monday and on the wednesday his book came out a copy of it arrived by the first post and he let me go out into the garden with it immediately after breakfast i read it from beginning to end that day and in the evening he asked me to remain with him the rest of the week and over the sunday that night my manuscript came back from mr pinhorn accompanied with a letter the gist of which was the desire to know what i meant by trying to fob off on him such stuff that was the meaning of the question if not exactly its form and it made my mistake immense to me such as this mistake was i could now only look it in the face and accept it i knew where i had failed but it was exactly where i couldnt have succeeded i had been sent down to be personal and then in point of fact hadnt been personal at all what i had dispatched to london was just a little finicking feverish study of my authors talent anything less relevant to mr pinhorns purpose couldnt well be imagined and he was visibly angry at my having at his expense with a secondclass ticket approached the subject of our enterprise only to stand off so helplessly for myself i knew but too well what had happened and how a miracle as pretty as some old miracle of legend had been wrought on the spot to save me there had been a big brush of wings the flash of an opaline robe and then with a great cool stir of the air the sense of an angels having swooped down and caught me to his bosom he held me only till the danger was over and it all took place in a minute with my manuscript back on my hands i understood the phenomenon better and the reflexions i made on it are what i meant at the beginning of this anecdote by my change of heart mr pinhorns note was not only a rebuke decidedly stern but an invitation immediately to send him it was the case to say so the genuine article the revealing and reverberating sketch to the promise of which and of which alone i owed my squandered privilege a week or two later i recast my peccant paper and giving it a particular application to mr paradays new book obtained for it the hospitality of another journal where i must admit mr pinhorn was so far vindicated as that it attracted not the least attention chapter iii i was frankly at the end of three days a very prejudiced critic so that one morning when in the garden my great man had offered to read me something i quite held my breath as i listened it was the written scheme of another book something put aside long ago before his illness but that he had lately taken out again to reconsider he had been turning it round when i came down on him and it had grown magnificently under this second hand loose liberal confident it might have passed for a great gossiping eloquent letter the overflow into talk of an artists amorous plan the theme i thought singularly rich quite the strongest he had yet treated and this familiar statement of it full too of fine maturities was really in summarised splendour a mine of gold a precious independent work i remember rather profanely wondering whether the ultimate production could possibly keep at the pitch his reading of the fond epistle at any rate made me feel as if i were for the advantage of posterity in close correspondence with him were the distinguished person to whom it had been affectionately addressed it was a high distinction simply to be told such things the idea he now communicated had all the freshness the flushed fairness of the conception untouched and untried it was venus rising from the sea and before the airs had blown upon her i had never been so throbbingly present at such an unveiling but when he had tossed the last bright word after the others as i had seen cashiers in banks weighing mounds of coin drop a final sovereign into the tray i knew a sudden prudent alarm my dear master how after all are you going to do it its infinitely noble but what time it will take what patience and independence what assured what perfect conditions oh for a lone isle in a tepid sea isnt this practically a lone isle and arent you as an encircling medium tepid enough he asked alluding with a laugh to the wonder of my young admiration and the narrow limits of his little provincial home time isnt what ive lacked hitherto the question hasnt been to find it but to use it of course my illness made while it lasted a great hole but i dare say there would have been a hole at any rate the earth we tread has more pockets than a billiardtable the great thing is now to keep on my feet thats exactly what i mean neil paraday looked at me with eyes such pleasant eyes as he had in which as i now recall their expression i seem to have seen a dim imagination of his fate he was fifty years old and his illness had been cruel his convalescence slow it isnt as if i werent all right oh if you werent all right i wouldnt look at you i tenderly said we had both got up quickened as by this clearer air and he had lighted a cigarette i had taken a fresh one which with an intenser smile by way of answer to my exclamation he applied to the flame of his match if i werent better i shouldnt have thought of that he flourished his script in his hand i dont want to be discouraging but thats not true i returned im sure that during the months you lay here in pain you had visitations sublime you thought of a thousand things you think of more and more all the while thats what makes you if youll pardon my familiarity so respectable at a time when so many people are spent you come into your second wind but thank god all the same youre better thank god too youre not as you were telling me yesterday successful if you werent a failure what would be the use of trying thats my one reserve on the subject of your recovery that it makes you score as the newspapers say it looks well in the newspapers and almost anything that does thats horrible we are happy to announce that mr paraday the celebrated author is again in the enjoyment of excellent health somehow i shouldnt like to see it you wont see it im not in the least celebrated my obscurity protects me but couldnt you bear even to see i was dying or dead my host enquired dead passe encore theres nothing so safe one never knows what a living artist may do one has mourned so many however one must make the worst of it you must be as dead as you can dont i meet that condition in having just published a book adequately let us hope for the books verily a masterpiece at this moment the parlourmaid appeared in the door that opened from the garden paraday lived at no great cost and the frisk of petticoats with a timorous sherry sir was about his modest mahogany he allowed half his income to his wife from whom he had succeeded in separating without redundancy of legend i had a general faith in his having behaved well and i had once in london taken mrs paraday down to dinner he now turned to speak to the maid who offered him on a tray some card or note while agitated excited i wandered to the end of the precinct the idea of his security became supremely dear to me and i asked myself if i were the same young man who had come down a few days before to scatter him to the four winds when i retraced my steps he had gone into the house and the woman the second london post had come in had placed my letters and a newspaper on a bench i sat down there to the letters which were a brief business and then without heeding the address took the paper from its envelope it was the journal of highest renown the empire of that morning it regularly came to paraday but i remembered that neither of us had yet looked at the copy already delivered this one had a great mark on the editorial page and uncrumpling the wrapper i saw it to be directed to my host and stamped with the name of his publishers i instantly divined that the empire had spoken of him and ive not forgotten the odd little shock of the circumstance it checked all eagerness and made me drop the paper a moment as i sat there conscious of a palpitation i think i had a vision of what was to be i had also a vision of the letter i would presently address to mr pinhorn breaking as it were with mr pinhorn of course however the next minute the voice of the empire was in my ears the article wasnt i thanked heaven a review it was a leader the last of three presenting neil paraday to the human race his new book the fifth from his hand had been but a day or two out and the empire already aware of it fired as if on the birth of a prince a salute of a whole column the guns had been booming these three hours in the house without our suspecting them the big blundering newspaper had discovered him and now he was proclaimed and anointed and crowned his place was assigned him as publicly as if a fat usher with a wand had pointed to the topmost chair he was to pass up and still up higher and higher between the watching faces and the envious sounds away up to the dais and the throne the article was epochmaking a landmark in his life he had taken rank at a bound waked up a national glory a national glory was needed and it was an immense convenience he was there what all this meant rolled over me and i fear i grew a little faint it meant so much more than i could say yea to on the spot in a flash somehow all was different the tremendous wave i speak of had swept something away it had knocked down i suppose my little customary altar my twinkling tapers and my flowers and had reared itself into the likeness of a temple vast and bare when neil paraday should come out of the house he would come out a contemporary that was what had happened the poor man was to be squeezed into his horrible age i felt as if he had been overtaken on the crest of the hill and brought back to the city a little more and he would have dipped down the short cut to posterity and escaped chapter iv when he came out it was exactly as if he had been in custody for beside him walked a stout man with a big black beard who save that he wore spectacles might have been a policeman and in whom at a second glance i recognised the highest contemporary enterprise this is mr morrow said paraday looking i thought rather white he wants to publish heaven knows what about me i winced as i remembered that this was exactly what i myself had wanted already i cried with a sort of sense that my friend had fled to me for protection mr morrow glared agreeably through his glasses they suggested the electric headlights of some monstrous modem ship and i felt as if paraday and i were tossing terrified under his bows i saw his momentum was irresistible i was confident that i should be the first in the field a great interest is naturally felt in mr paradays surroundings he heavily observed i hadnt the least idea of it said paraday as if he had been told he had been snoring i find he hasnt read the article in the empire mr morrow remarked to me thats so very interesting its something to start with he smiled he had begun to pull off his gloves which were violently new and to look encouragingly round the little garden as a surrounding i felt how i myself had already been taken in i was a little fish in the stomach of a bigger one i represent our visitor continued a syndicate of influential journals no less than thirtyseven whose public whose publics i may say are in peculiar sympathy with mr paradays line of thought they would greatly appreciate any expression of his views on the subject of the art he so nobly exemplifies in addition to my connexion with the syndicate just mentioned i hold a particular commission from the tatler whose most prominent department smatter and chatter i dare say youve often enjoyed it attracts such attention i was honoured only last week as a representative of the tatler with the confidence of guy walsingham the brilliant author of obsessions she pronounced herself thoroughly pleased with my sketch of her method she went so far as to say that i had made her genius more comprehensible even to herself neil paraday had dropped on the gardenbench and sat there at once detached and confounded he looked hard at a bare spot in the lawn as if with an anxiety that had suddenly made him grave his movement had been interpreted by his visitor as an invitation to sink sympathetically into a wicker chair that stood hard by and while mr morrow so settled himself i felt he had taken official possession and that there was no undoing it one had heard of unfortunate peoples having a man in the house and this was just what we had there was a silence of a moment during which we seemed to acknowledge in the only way that was possible the presence of universal fate the sunny stillness took no pity and my thought as i was sure paradays was doing performed within the minute a great distant revolution i saw just how emphatic i should make my rejoinder to mr pinhorn and that having come like mr morrow to betray i must remain as long as possible to save not because i had brought my mind back but because our visitors last words were in my ear i presently enquired with gloomy irrelevance if guy walsingham were a woman oh yes a mere pseudonym rather pretty isnt it and convenient you know for a lady who goes in for the larger latitude obsessions by miss soandso would look a little odd but men are more naturally indelicate have you peeped into obsessions mr morrow continued sociably to our companion paraday still absent remote made no answer as if he hadnt heard the question a form of intercourse that appeared to suit the cheerful mr morrow as well as any other imperturbably bland he was a man of resources he only needed to be on the spot he had pocketed the whole poor place while paraday and i were woolgathering and i could imagine that he had already got his heads his system at any rate was justified by the inevitability with which i replied to save my friend the trouble dear no he hasnt read it he doesnt read such things i unwarily added things that are too far over the fence eh i was indeed a godsend to mr morrow it was the psychological moment it determined the appearance of his notebook which however he at first kept slightly behind him even as the dentist approaching his victim keeps the horrible forceps mr paraday holds with the good old proprieties i see and thinking of the thirtyseven influential journals i found myself as i found poor paraday helplessly assisting at the promulgation of this ineptitude theres no point on which distinguished views are so acceptable as on this question raised perhaps more strikingly than ever by guy walsingham of the permissibility of the larger latitude ive an appointment precisely in connexion with it next week with dora forbes author of the other way round which everybodys talking about has mr paraday glanced at the other way round mr morrow now frankly appealed to me i took on myself to repudiate the supposition while our companion still silent got up nervously and walked away his visitor paid no heed to his withdrawal but opened out the notebook with a more fatherly pat dora forbes i gather takes the ground the same as guy walsinghams that the larger latitude has simply got to come he holds that it has got to be squarely faced of course his sex makes him a less prejudiced witness but an authoritative word from mr paraday from the point of view of his sex you know would go right round the globe he takes the line that we havent got to face it i was bewildered it sounded somehow as if there were three sexes my interlocutors pencil was poised my private responsibility great i simply sat staring none the less and only found presence of mind to say is this miss forbes a gentleman mr morrow had a subtle smile it wouldnt be miss theres a wife i mean is she a man the wife mr morrow was for a moment as confused as myself but when i explained that i alluded to dora forbes in person he informed me with visible amusement at my being so out of it that this was the penname of an indubitable male he had a big red moustache he goes in for the slight mystification because the ladies are such popular favourites a great deal of interest is felt in his acting on that idea which is clever isnt it and theres every prospect of its being widely imitated our host at this moment joined us again and mr morrow remarked invitingly that he should be happy to make a note of any observation the movement in question the bid for success under a ladys name might suggest to mr paraday but the poor man without catching the allusion excused himself pleading that though greatly honoured by his visitors interest he suddenly felt unwell and should have to take leave of him have to go and lie down and keep quiet his young friend might be trusted to answer for him but he hoped mr morrow didnt expect great things even of his young friend his young friend at this moment looked at neil paraday with an anxious eye greatly wondering if he were doomed to be ill again but paradays own kind face met his question reassuringly seemed to say in a glance intelligible enough oh im not ill but im scared get him out of the house as quietly as possible getting newspapermen out of the house was odd business for an emissary of mr pinhorn and i was so exhilarated by the idea of it that i called after him as he left us read the article in the empire and youll soon be all right chapter v delicious my having come down to tell him of it mr morrow ejaculated my cab was at the door twenty minutes after the empire had been laid on my breakfasttable now what have you got for me he continued dropping again into his chair from which however he the next moment eagerly rose i was shown into the drawingroom but there must be more to see his study his literary sanctum the little things he has about or other domestic objects and features he wouldnt be lying down on his studytable theres a great interest always felt in the scene of an authors labours sometimes were favoured with very delightful peeps dora forbes showed me all his tabledrawers and almost jammed my hand into one into which i made a dash i dont ask that of you but if we could talk things over right there where he sits i feel as if i should get the keynote i had no wish whatever to be rude to mr morrow i was much too initiated not to tend to more diplomacy but i had a quick inspiration and i entertained an insurmountable an almost superstitious objection to his crossing the threshold of my friends little lonely shabby consecrated workshop no no we shant get at his life that way i said the way to get at his life is to but wait a moment i broke off and went quickly into the house whence i in three minutes reappeared before mr morrow with the two volumes of paradays new book his lifes here i went on and im so full of this admirable thing that i cant talk of anything else the artists lifes his work and this is the place to observe him what he has to tell us he tells us with this perfection my dear sir the best interviewer is the best reader mr morrow goodhumouredly protested do you mean to say that no other source of information should be open to us none other till this particular one by far the most copious has been quite exhausted have you exhausted it my dear sir had you exhausted it when you came down here it seems to me in our time almost wholly neglected and something should surely be done to restore its ruined credit its the course to which the artist himself at every step and with such pathetic confidence refers us this last book of mr paradays is full of revelations revelations panted mr morrow whom i had forced again into his chair the only kind that count it tells you with a perfection that seems to me quite final all the author thinks for instance about the advent of the larger latitude where does it do that asked mr morrow who had picked up the second volume and was insincerely thumbing it everywhere in the whole treatment of his case extract the opinion disengage the answer those are the real acts of homage mr morrow after a minute tossed the book away ah but you mustnt take me for a reviewer heaven forbid i should take you for anything so dreadful you came down to perform a little act of sympathy and so i may confide to you did i let us perform our little act together these pages overflow with the testimony we want let us read them and taste them and interpret them youll of course have perceived for yourself that one scarcely does read neil paraday till one reads him aloud he gives out to the ear an extraordinary full tone and its only when you expose it confidently to that test that you really get near his style take up your book again and let me listen while you pay it out to that wonderful fifteenth chapter if you feel you cant do it justice compose yourself to attention while i produce for you i think i can this scarcely less admirable ninth mr morrow gave me a straight look which was as hard as a blow between the eyes he had turned rather red and a question had formed itself in his mind which reached my sense as distinctly as if he had uttered it what sort of a damned fool are you then he got up gathering together his hat and gloves buttoning his coat projecting hungrily all over the place the big transparency of his mask it seemed to flare over fleet street and somehow made the actual spot distressingly humble there was so little for it to feed on unless he counted the blisters of our stucco or saw his way to do something with the roses even the poor roses were common kinds presently his eyes fell on the manuscript from which paraday had been reading to me and which still lay on the bench as my own followed them i saw it looked promising looked pregnant as if it gently throbbed with the life the reader had given it mr morrow indulged in a nod at it and a vague thrust of his umbrella whats that oh its a plan a secret a secret there was an instants silence and then mr morrow made another movement i may have been mistaken but it affected me as the translated impulse of the desire to lay hands on the manuscript and this led me to indulge in a quick anticipatory grab which may very well have seemed ungraceful or even impertinent and which at any rate left mr paradays two admirers very erect glaring at each other while one of them held a bundle of papers well behind him an instant later mr morrow quitted me abruptly as if he had really carried something off with him to reassure myself watching his broad back recede i only grasped my manuscript the tighter he went to the back door of the house the one he had come out from but on trying the handle he appeared to find it fastened so he passed round into the front garden and by listening intently enough i could presently hear the outer gate close behind him with a bang i thought again of the thirtyseven influential journals and wondered what would be his revenge i hasten to add that he was magnanimous which was just the most dreadful thing he could have been the tatler published a charming chatty familiar account of mr paradays homelife and on the wings of the thirtyseven influential journals it went to use mr morrows own expression right round the globe chapter vi a week later early in may my glorified friend came up to town where it may be veraciously recorded he was the king of the beasts of the year no advancement was ever more rapid no exaltation more complete no bewilderment more teachable his book sold but moderately though the article in the empire had done unwonted wonders for it but he circulated in person to a measure that the libraries might well have envied his formula had been found he was a revelation his momentary terror had been real just as mine had been the overclouding of his passionate desire to be left to finish his work he was far from unsociable but he had the finest conception of being let alone that ive ever met for the time none the less he took his profit where it seemed most to crowd on him having in his pocket the portable sophistries about the nature of the artists task observation too was a kind of work and experience a kind of success london dinners were all material and london ladies were fruitful toil no one has the faintest conception of what im trying for he said to me and not many have read three pages that ive written but i must dine with them first theyll find out why when theyve time it was rather rude justice perhaps but the fatigue had the merit of being a new sort while the phantasmagoric town was probably after all less of a battlefield than the haunted study he once told me that he had had no personal life to speak of since his fortieth year but had had more than was good for him before london closed the parenthesis and exhibited him in relations one of the most inevitable of these being that in which he found himself to mrs weeks wimbush wife of the boundless brewer and proprietress of the universal menagerie in this establishment as everybody knows on occasions when the crush is great the animals rub shoulders freely with the spectators and the lions sit down for whole evenings with the lambs it had been ominously clear to me from the first that in neil paraday this lady who as all the world agreed was tremendous fun considered that she had secured a prime attraction a creature of almost heraldic oddity nothing could exceed her enthusiasm over her capture and nothing could exceed the confused apprehensions it excited in me i had an instinctive fear of her which i tried without effect to conceal from her victim but which i let her notice with perfect impunity paraday heeded it but she never did for her conscience was that of a romping child she was a blind violent force to which i could attach no more idea of responsibility than to the creaking of a sign in the wind it was difficult to say what she conduced to but circulation she was constructed of steel and leather and all i asked of her for our tractable friend was not to do him to death he had consented for a time to be of indiarubber but my thoughts were fixed on the day he should resume his shape or at least get back into his box it was evidently all right but i should be glad when it was well over i had a special fear the impression was ineffaceable of the hour when after mr morrows departure i had found him on the sofa in his study that pretext of indisposition had not in the least been meant as a snub to the envoy of the tatler he had gone to lie down in very truth he had felt a pang of his old pain the result of the agitation wrought in him by this forcing open of a new period his old programme his old ideal even had to be changed say what one would success was a complication and recognition had to be reciprocal the monastic life the pious illumination of the missal in the convent cell were things of the gathered past it didnt engender despair but at least it required adjustment before i left him on that occasion we had passed a bargain my part of which was that i should make it my business to take care of him let whoever would represent the interest in his presence i must have had a mystical prevision of mrs weeks wimbush i should represent the interest in his work or otherwise expressed in his absence these two interests were in their essence opposed and i doubt as youth is fleeting if i shall ever again know the intensity of joy with which i felt that in so good a cause i was willing to make myself odious one day in sloane street i found myself questioning paradays landlord who had come to the door in answer to my knock two vehicles a barouche and a smart hansom were drawn up before the house in the drawingroom sir mrs weeks wimbush and in the diningroom a young lady sir waiting i think a foreigner it was three oclock and on days when paraday didnt lunch out he attached a value to these appropriated hours on which days however didnt the dear man lunch out mrs wimbush at such a crisis would have rushed round immediately after her own repast i went into the diningroom first postponing the pleasure of seeing how upstairs the lady of the barouche would on my arrival point the moral of my sweet solicitude no one took such an interest as herself in his doing only what was good for him and she was always on the spot to see that he did it she made appointments with him to discuss the best means of economising his time and protecting his privacy she further made his health her special business and had so much sympathy with my own zeal for it that she was the author of pleasing fictions on the subject of what my devotion had led me to give up i gave up nothing i dont count mr pinhorn because i had nothing and all i had as yet achieved was to find myself also in the menagerie i had dashed in to save my friend but i had only got domesticated and wedged so that i could do little more for him than exchange with him over peoples heads looks of intense but futile intelligence chapter vii the young lady in the diningroom had a brave face black hair blue eyes and in her lap a big volume ive come for his autograph she said when i had explained to her that i was under bonds to see people for him when he was occupied ive been waiting half an hour but im prepared to wait all day i dont know whether it was this that told me she was american for the propensity to wait all day is not in general characteristic of her race i was enlightened probably not so much by the spirit of the utterance as by some quality of its sound at any rate i saw she had an individual patience and a lovely frock together with an expression that played among her pretty features like a breeze among flowers putting her book on the table she showed me a massive album showily bound and full of autographs of price the collection of faded notes of still more faded thoughts of quotations platitudes signatures represented a formidable purpose i could only disclose my dread of it most people apply to mr paraday by letter you know yes but he doesnt answer ive written three times very true i reflected the sort of letter you mean goes straight into the fire how do you know the sort i mean my interlocutress had blushed and smiled and in a moment she added i dont believe he gets many like them im sure theyre beautiful but he burns without reading i didnt add that i had convinced him he ought to isnt he then in danger of burning things of importance he would perhaps be so if distinguished men hadnt an infallible nose for nonsense she looked at me a moment her face was sweet and gay do you burn without reading too in answer to which i assured her that if shed trust me with her repository id see that mr paraday should write his name in it she considered a little thats very well but it wouldnt make me see him do you want very much to see him it seemed ungracious to catechise so charming a creature but somehow i had never yet taken my duty to the great author so seriously enough to have come from america for the purpose i stared all alone i dont see that thats exactly your business but if it will make me more seductive ill confess that im quite by myself i had to come alone or not come at all she was interesting i could imagine she had lost parents natural protectors could conceive even she had inherited money i was at a pass of my own fortunes when keeping hansoms at doors seemed to me pure swagger as a trick of this bold and sensitive girl however it became romantic a part of the general romance of her freedom her errand her innocence the confidence of young americans was notorious and i speedily arrived at a conviction that no impulse could have been more generous than the impulse that had operated here i foresaw at that moment that it would make her my peculiar charge just as circumstances had made neil paraday she would be another person to look after so that ones honour would be concerned in guiding her straight these things became clearer to me later on at the instant i had scepticism enough to observe to her as i turned the pages of her volume that her net had all the same caught many a big fish she appeared to have had fruitful access to the great ones of the earth there were people moreover whose signatures she had presumably secured without a personal interview she couldnt have worried george washington and friedrich schiller and hannah more she met this argument to my surprise by throwing up the album without a pang it wasnt even her own she was responsible for none of its treasures it belonged to a girlfriend in america a young lady in a western city this young lady had insisted on her bringing it to pick up more autographs she thought they might like to see in europe in what company they would be the girlfriend the western city the immortal names the curious errand the idyllic faith all made a story as strange to me and as beguiling as some tale in the arabian nights thus it was that my informant had encumbered herself with the ponderous tome but she hastened to assure me that this was the first time she had brought it out for her visit to mr paraday it had simply been a pretext she didnt really care a straw that he should write his name what she did want was to look straight into his face i demurred a little and why do you require to do that because i just love him before i could recover from the agitating effect of this crystal ring my companion had continued hasnt there ever been any face that youve wanted to look into how could i tell her so soon how much i appreciated the opportunity of looking into hers i could only assent in general to the proposition that there were certainly for every one such yearnings and even such faces and i felt the crisis demand all my lucidity all my wisdom oh yes im a student of physiognomy do you mean i pursued that youve a passion for mr paradays books theyve been everything to me and a little more beside i know them by heart theyve completely taken hold of me theres no author about whom im in such a state as im in about neil paraday permit me to remark then i presently returned that youre one of the right sort one of the enthusiasts of course i am oh there are enthusiasts who are quite of the wrong i mean youre one of those to whom an appeal can be made an appeal her face lighted as if with the chance of some great sacrifice if she was ready for one it was only waiting for her and in a moment i mentioned it give up this crude purpose of seeing him go away without it that will be far better she looked mystified then turned visibly pale why hasnt he any personal charm the girl was terrible and laughable in her bright directness ah that dreadful word personally i wailed were dying of it for you women bring it out with murderous effect when you meet with a genius as fine as this idol of ours let him off the dreary duty of being a personality as well know him only by whats best in him and spare him for the same sweet sake my young lady continued to look at me in confusion and mistrust and the result of her reflexion on what i had just said was to make her suddenly break out look here sir whats the matter with him the matter with him is that if he doesnt look out people will eat a great hole in his life she turned it over he hasnt any disfigurement nothing to speak of do you mean that social engagements interfere with his occupations that but feebly expresses it so that he cant give himself up to his beautiful imagination hes beset badgered bothered hes pulled to pieces on the pretext of being applauded people expect him to give them his time his golden time who wouldnt themselves give five shillings for one of his books five id give five thousand give your sympathy give your forbearance twothirds of those who approach him only do it to advertise themselves why its too bad the girl exclaimed with the face of an angel its the first time i was ever called crude she laughed i followed up my advantage theres a lady with him now whos a terrible complication and who yet hasnt read im sure ten pages he ever wrote my visitors wide eyes grew tenderer then how does she talk without ceasing i only mention her as a single case do you want to know how to show a superlative consideration simply avoid him avoid him she despairingly breathed dont force him to have to take account of you admire him in silence cultivate him at a distance and secretly appropriate his message do you want to know i continued warming to my idea how to perform an act of homage really sublime then as she hung on my words succeed in never seeing him at all never at all she suppressed a shriek for it the more you get into his writings the less youll want to and youll be immensely sustained by the thought of the good youre doing him she looked at me without resentment or spite and at the truth i had put before her with candour credulity pity i was afterwards happy to remember that she must have gathered from my face the liveliness of my interest in herself i think i see what you mean oh i express it badly but i should be delighted if youd let me come to see you to explain it better she made no response to this and her thoughtful eyes fell on the big album on which she presently laid her hands as if to take it away i did use to say out west that they might write a little less for autographs to all the great poets you know and study the thoughts and style a little more what do they care for the thoughts and style they didnt even understand you im not sure i added that i do myself and i dare say that you by no means make me out she had got up to go and though i wanted her to succeed in not seeing neil paraday i wanted her also inconsequently to remain in the house i was at any rate far from desiring to hustle her off as mrs weeks wimbush upstairs was still saving our friend in her own way i asked my young lady to let me briefly relate in illustration of my point the little incident of my having gone down into the country for a profane purpose and been converted on the spot to holiness sinking again into her chair to listen she showed a deep interest in the anecdote then thinking it over gravely she returned with her odd intonation yes but you do see him i had to admit that this was the case and i wasnt so prepared with an effective attenuation as i could have wished she eased the situation off however by the charming quaintness with which she finally said well i wouldnt want him to be lonely this time she rose in earnest but i persuaded her to let me keep the album to show mr paraday i assured her id bring it back to her myself well youll find my address somewhere in it on a paper she sighed all resignedly at the door chapter viii i blush to confess it but i invited mr paraday that very day to transcribe into the album one of his most characteristic passages i told him how i had got rid of the strange girl who had brought it her ominous name was miss hurter and she lived at an hotel quite agreeing with him moreover as to the wisdom of getting rid with equal promptitude of the book itself this was why i carried it to albemarle street no later than on the morrow i failed to find her at home but she wrote to me and i went again she wanted so much to hear more about neil paraday i returned repeatedly i may briefly declare to supply her with this information she had been immensely taken the more she thought of it with that idea of mine about the act of homage it had ended by filling her with a generous rapture she positively desired to do something sublime for him though indeed i could see that as this particular flight was difficult she appreciated the fact that my visits kept her up i had it on my conscience to keep her up i neglected nothing that would contribute to it and her conception of our cherished authors independence became at last as fine as his very own read him read him that will be an education in decency i constantly repeated while seeking him in his works even as god in nature she represented herself as convinced that according to my assurance this was the system that had as she expressed it weaned her we read him together when i could find time and the generous creatures sacrifice was fed by our communion there were twenty selfish women about whom i told her and who stirred her to a beautiful rage immediately after my first visit her sister mrs milsom came over from paris and the two ladies began to present as they called it their letters i thanked our stars that none had been presented to mr paraday they received invitations and dined out and some of these occasions enabled fanny hurter to perform for consistencys sake touching feats of submission nothing indeed would now have induced her even to look at the object of her admiration once hearing his name announced at a party she instantly left the room by another door and then straightway quitted the house at another time when i was at the opera with them mrs milsom had invited me to their box i attempted to point mr paraday out to her in the stalls on this she asked her sister to change places with her and while that lady devoured the great man through a powerful glass presented all the rest of the evening her inspired back to the house to torment her tenderly i pressed the glass upon her telling her how wonderfully near it brought our friends handsome head by way of answer she simply looked at me in charged silence letting me see that tears had gathered in her eyes these tears i may remark produced an effect on me of which the end is not yet there was a moment when i felt it my duty to mention them to neil paraday but i was deterred by the reflexion that there were questions more relevant to his happiness these question indeed by the end of the season were reduced to a single one the question of reconstituting so far as might be possible the conditions under which he had produced his best work such conditions could never all come back for there was a new one that took up too much place but some perhaps were not beyond recall i wanted above all things to see him sit down to the subject he had on my making his acquaintance read me that admirable sketch of something told me there was no security but in his doing so before the new factor as we used to say at mr pinhorns should render the problem incalculable it only halfreassured me that the sketch itself was so copious and so eloquent that even at the worst there would be the making of a small but complete book a tiny volume which for the faithful might well become an object of adoration there would even not be wanting critics to declare i foresaw that the plan was a thing to be more thankful for than the structure to have been reared on it my impatience for the structure none the less grew and grew with the interruptions he had on coming up to town begun to sit for his portrait to a young painter mr rumble whose little game as we also used to say at mr pinhorns was to be the first to perch on the shoulders of renown mr rumbles studio was a circus in which the man of the hour and still more the woman leaped through the hoops of his showy frames almost as electrically as they burst into telegrams and specials he pranced into the exhibitions on their back he was the reporter on canvas the vandyke up to date and there was one roaring year in which mrs bounder and miss braby guy walsingham and dora forbes proclaimed in chorus from the same pictured walls that no one had yet got ahead of him paraday had been promptly caught and saddled accepting with characteristic goodhumour his confidential hint that to figure in his show was not so much a consequence as a cause of immortality from mrs wimbush to the last representative who called to ascertain his twelve favourite dishes it was the same ingenuous assumption that he would rejoice in the repercussion there were moments when i fancied i might have had more patience with them if they hadnt been so fatally benevolent i hated at all events mr rumbles picture and had my bottled resentment ready when later on i found my distracted friend had been stuffed by mrs wimbush into the mouth of another cannon a young artist in whom she was intensely interested and who had no connexion with mr rumble was to show how far he could make him go poor paraday in return was naturally to write something somewhere about the young artist she played her victims against each other with admirable ingenuity and her establishment was a huge machine in which the tiniest and the biggest wheels went round to the same treadle i had a scene with her in which i tried to express that the function of such a man was to exercise his genius not to serve as a hoarding for pictorial posters the people i was perhaps angriest with were the editors of magazines who had introduced what they called new features so aware were they that the newest feature of all would be to make him grind their axes by contributing his views on vital topics and taking part in the periodical prattle about the future of fiction i made sure that before i should have done with him there would scarcely be a current form of words left me to be sick of but meanwhile i could make surer still of my animosity to bustling ladies for whom he drew the water that irrigated their social flowerbeds i had a battle with mrs wimbush over the artist she protected and another over the question of a certain week at the end of july that mr paraday appeared to have contracted to spend with her in the country i protested against this visit i intimated that he was too unwell for hospitality without a nuance for caresses without imagination i begged he might rather take the time in some restorative way a sultry air of promises of ponderous parties hung over his august and he would greatly profit by the interval of rest he hadnt told me he was ill again that he had had a warning but i hadnt needed this for i found his reticence his worst symptom the only thing he said to me was that he believed a comfortable attack of something or other would set him up it would put out of the question everything but the exemptions he prized im afraid i shall have presented him as a martyr in a very small cause if i fail to explain that he surrendered himself much more liberally than i surrendered him he filled his lungs for the most part with the comedy of his queer fate the tragedy was in the spectacles through which i chose to look he was conscious of inconvenience and above all of a great renouncement but how could he have heard a mere dirge in the bells of his accession the sagacity and the jealousy were mine and his the impressions and the harvest of course as regards mrs wimbush i was worsted in my encounters for wasnt the state of his health the very reason for his coming to her at prestidge wasnt it precisely at prestidge that he was to be coddled and wasnt the dear princess coming to help her to coddle him the dear princess now on a visit to england was of a famous foreign house and in her gilded cage with her retinue of keepers and feeders was the most expensive specimen in the good ladys collection i dont think her august presence had had to do with paradays consenting to go but its not impossible he had operated as a bait to the illustrious stranger the party had been made up for him mrs wimbush averred and every one was counting on it the dear princess most of all if he was well enough he was to read them something absolutely fresh and it was on that particular prospect the princess had set her heart she was so fond of genius in any walk of life and was so used to it and understood it so well she was the greatest of mr paradays admirers she devoured everything he wrote and then he read like an angel mrs wimbush reminded me that he had again and again given her mrs wimbush the privilege of listening to him i looked at her a moment what has he read to you i crudely enquired for a moment too she met my eyes and for the fraction of a moment she hesitated and coloured oh all sorts of things i wondered if this were an imperfect recollection or only a perfect fib and she quite understood my unuttered comment on her measure of such things but if she could forget neil paradays beauties she could of course forget my rudeness and three days later she invited me by telegraph to join the party at prestidge this time she might indeed have had a story about what i had given up to be near the master i addressed from that fine residence several communications to a young lady in london a young lady whom i confess i quitted with reluctance and whom the reminder of what she herself could give up was required to make me quit at all it adds to the gratitude i owe her on other grounds that she kindly allows me to transcribe from my letters a few of the passages in which that hateful sojourn is candidly commemorated chapter ix i suppose i ought to enjoy the joke of whats going on here i wrote but somehow it doesnt amuse me pessimism on the contrary possesses me and cynicism deeply engages i positively feel my own flesh sore from the brass nails in neil paradays social harness the house is full of people who like him as they mention awfully and with whom his talent for talking nonsense has prodigious success i delight in his nonsense myself why is it therefore that i grudge these happy folk their artless satisfaction mystery of the human heart abyss of the critical spirit mrs wimbush thinks she can answer that question and as my want of gaiety has at last worn out her patience she has given me a glimpse of her shrewd guess im made restless by the selfishness of the insincere friend i want to monopolise paraday in order that he may push me on to be intimate with him is a feather in my cap it gives me an importance that i couldnt naturally pretend to and i seek to deprive him of social refreshment because i fear that meeting more disinterested people may enlighten him as to my real motive all the disinterested people here are his particular admirers and have been carefully selected as such theres supposed to be a copy of his last book in the house and in the hall i come upon ladies in attitudes bending gracefully over the first volume i discreetly avert my eyes and when i next look round the precarious joy has been superseded by the book of life theres a sociable circle or a confidential couple and the relinquished volume lies open on its face and as dropped under extreme coercion somebody else presently finds it and transfers it with its air of momentary desolation to another piece of furniture every ones asking every one about it all day and every ones telling every one where they put it last im sure its rather smudgy about the twentieth page ive a strong impression too that the second volume is lost has been packed in the bag of some departing guest and yet everybody has the impression that somebody else has read to the end you see therefore that the beautiful book plays a great part in our existence why should i take the occasion of such distinguished honours to say that i begin to see deeper into gustave flauberts doleful refrain about the hatred of literature i refer you again to the perverse constitution of man the princess is a massive lady with the organisation of an athlete and the confusion of tongues of a valet de place she contrives to commit herself extraordinarily little in a great many languages and is entertained and conversed with in detachments and relays like an institution which goes on from generation to generation or a big building contracted for under a forfeit she cant have a personal taste any more than when her husband succeeds she can have a personal crown and her opinion on any matter is rusty and heavy and plain made in the night of ages to last and be transmitted i feel as if i ought to tip some custode for my glimpse of it she has been told everything in the world and has never perceived anything and the echoes of her education respond awfully to the rash footfall i mean the casual remark in the cold valhalla of her memory mrs wimbush delights in her wit and says theres nothing so charming as to hear mr paraday draw it out hes perpetually detailed for this job and he tells me it has a peculiarly exhausting effect every ones beginning at the end of two days to sidle obsequiously away from her and mrs wimbush pushes him again and again into the breach none of the uses i have yet seen him put to infuriate me quite so much he looks very fagged and has at last confessed to me that his condition makes him uneasy has even promised me hell go straight home instead of returning to his final engagements in town last night i had some talk with him about going today cutting his visit short so sure am i that hell be better as soon as hes shut up in his lighthouse he told me that this is what he would like to do reminding me however that the first lesson of his greatness has been precisely that he cant do what he likes mrs wimbush would never forgive him if he should leave her before the princess has received the last hand when i hint that a violent rupture with our hostess would be the best thing in the world for him he gives me to understand that if his reason assents to the proposition his courage hangs woefully back he makes no secret of being mortally afraid of her and when i ask what harm she can do him that she hasnt already done he simply repeats im afraid im afraid dont enquire too closely he said last night only believe that i feel a sort of terror its strange when shes so kind at any rate id as soon overturn that piece of priceless sevres as tell her i must go before my date it sounds dreadfully weak but he has some reason and he pays for his imagination which puts him i should hate it in the place of others and makes him feel even against himself their feelings their appetites their motives its indeed inveterately against himself that he makes his imagination act what a pity he has such a lot of it hes too beastly intelligent besides the famous readings still to come off and it has been postponed a day to allow guy walsingham to arrive it appears this eminent ladys staying at a house a few miles off which means of course that mrs wimbush has forcibly annexed her shes to come over in a day or two mrs wimbush wants her to hear mr paraday todays wet and cold and several of the company at the invitation of the duke have driven over to luncheon at bigwood i saw poor paraday wedge himself by command into the little supplementary seat of a brougham in which the princess and our hostess were already ensconced if the front glass isnt open on his dear old back perhaps hell survive bigwood i believe is very grand and frigid all marble and precedence and i wish him well out of the adventure i cant tell you how much more and more your attitude to him in the midst of all this shines out by contrast i never willingly talk to these people about him but see what a comfort i find it to scribble to you i appreciate it it keeps me warm there are no fires in the house mrs wimbush goes by the calendar the temperature goes by the weather the weather goes by god knows what and the princess is easily heated ive nothing but my acrimony to warm me and have been out under an umbrella to restore my circulation coming in an hour ago i found lady augusta minch rummaging about the hall when i asked her what she was looking for she said she had mislaid something that mr paraday had lent her i ascertained in a moment that the article in question is a manuscript and ive a foreboding that its the noble morsel he read me six weeks ago when i expressed my surprise that he should have bandied about anything so precious i happen to know its his only copy in the most beautiful hand in all the world lady augusta confessed to me that she hadnt had it from himself but from mrs wimbush who had wished to give her a glimpse of it as a salve for her not being able to stay and hear it read is that the piece hes to read i asked when guy walsingham arrives its not for guy walsingham theyre waiting now its for dora forbes lady augusta said shes coming i believe early tomorrow meanwhile mrs wimbush has found out about him and is actively wiring to him she says he also must hear him you bewilder me a little i replied in the age we live in one gets lost among the genders and the pronouns the clear thing is that mrs wimbush doesnt guard such a treasure so jealously as she might poor dear she has the princess to guard mr paraday lent her the manuscript to look over she spoke you mean as if it were the morning paper lady augusta stared my irony was lost on her she didnt have time so she gave me a chance first because unfortunately i go tomorrow to bigwood and your chance has only proved a chance to lose it i havent lost it i remember now it was very stupid of me to have forgotten i told my maid to give it to lord dorimont or at least to his man and lord dorimont went away directly after luncheon of course he gave it back to my maid or else his man did said lady augusta i dare say its all right the conscience of these people is like a summer sea they havent time to look over a priceless composition theyve only time to kick it about the house i suggested that the man fired with a noble emulation had perhaps kept the work for his own perusal and her ladyship wanted to know whether if the thing shouldnt reappear for the grand occasion appointed by our hostess the author wouldnt have something else to read that would do just as well their questions are too delightful i declared to lady augusta briefly that nothing in the world can ever do so well as the thing that does best and at this she looked a little disconcerted but i added that if the manuscript had gone astray our little circle would have the less of an effort of attention to make the piece in question was very long it would keep them three hours three hours oh the princess will get up said lady augusta i thought she was mr paradays greatest admirer i dare say she is shes so awfully clever but whats the use of being a princess if you cant dissemble your love i asked as lady augusta was vague she said at any rate shed question her maid and im hoping that when i go down to dinner i shall find the manuscript has been recovered chapter x it has not been recovered i wrote early the next day and im moreover much troubled about our friend he came back from bigwood with a chill and being allowed to have a fire in his room lay down a while before dinner i tried to send him to bed and indeed thought i had put him in the way of it but after i had gone to dress mrs wimbush came up to see him with the inevitable result that when i returned i found him under arms and flushed and feverish though decorated with the rare flower she had brought him for his buttonhole he came down to dinner but lady augusta minch was very shy of him today hes in great pain and the advent of ces dames i mean of guy walsingham and dora forbes doesnt at all console me it does mrs wimbush however for she has consented to his remaining in bed so that he may be all right tomorrow for the listening circle guy walsinghams already on the scene and the doctor for paraday also arrived early i havent yet seen the author of obsessions but of course ive had a moment by myself with the doctor i tried to get him to say that our invalid must go straight home i mean tomorrow or next day but he quite refuses to talk about the future absolute quiet and warmth and the regular administration of an important remedy are the points he mainly insists on he returns this afternoon and im to go back to see the patient at one oclock when he next takes his medicine it consoles me a little that he certainly wont be able to read an exertion he was already more than unfit for lady augusta went off after breakfast assuring me her first care would be to follow up the lost manuscript i can see she thinks me a shocking busybody and doesnt understand my alarm but shell do what she can for shes a goodnatured woman so are they all honourable men that was precisely what made her give the thing to lord dorimont and made lord dorimont bag it what use he has for it god only knows ive the worst forebodings but somehow im strangely without passion desperately calm as i consider the unconscious the wellmeaning ravages of our appreciative circle i bow my head in submission to some great natural some universal accident im rendered almost indifferent in fact quite gay haha by the sense of immitigable fate lady augusta promises me to trace the precious object and let me have it through the post by the time paradays well enough to play his part with it the last evidence is that her maid did give it to his lordships valet one would suppose it some thrilling number of the family budget mrs wimbush whos aware of the accident is much less agitated by it than she would doubtless be were she not for the hour inevitably engrossed with guy walsingham later in the day i informed my correspondent for whom indeed i kept a loose diary of the situation that i had made the acquaintance of this celebrity and that she was a pretty little girl who wore her hair in what used to be called a crop she looked so juvenile and so innocent that if as mr morrow had announced she was resigned to the larger latitude her superiority to prejudice must have come to her early i spent most of the day hovering about neil paradays room but it was communicated to me from below that guy walsingham at prestidge was a success toward evening i became conscious somehow that her superiority was contagious and by the time the company separated for the night i was sure the larger latitude had been generally accepted i thought of dora forbes and felt that he had no time to lose before dinner i received a telegram from lady augusta minch lord dorimont thinks he must have left bundle in train enquire how could i enquire if i was to take the word as a command i was too worried and now too alarmed about neil paraday the doctor came back and it was an immense satisfaction to me to be sure he was wise and interested he was proud of being called to so distinguished a patient but he admitted to me that night that my friend was gravely ill it was really a relapse a recrudescence of his old malady there could be no question of moving him we must at any rate see first on the spot what turn his condition would take meanwhile on the morrow he was to have a nurse on the morrow the dear man was easier and my spirits rose to such cheerfulness that i could almost laugh over lady augustas second telegram lord dorimonts servant been to station nothing found push enquiries i did laugh im sure as i remembered this to be the mystic scroll i had scarcely allowed poor mr morrow to point his umbrella at fool that i had been the thirtyseven influential journals wouldnt have destroyed it theyd only have printed it of course i said nothing to paraday when the nurse arrived she turned me out of the room on which i went downstairs i should premise that at breakfast the news that our brilliant friend was doing well excited universal complacency and the princess graciously remarked that he was only to be commiserated for missing the society of miss collop mrs wimbush whose social gift never shone brighter than in the dry decorum with which she accepted this fizzle in her fireworks mentioned to me that guy walsingham had made a very favourable impression on her imperial highness indeed i think every one did so and that like the moneymarket or the national honour her imperial highness was constitutionally sensitive there was a certain gladness a perceptible bustle in the air however which i thought slightly anomalous in a house where a great author lay critically ill le roy est mort vive le roy i was reminded that another great author had already stepped into his shoes when i came down again after the nurse had taken possession i found a strange gentleman hanging about the hall and pacing to and fro by the closed door of the drawingroom this personage was florid and bald he had a big red moustache and wore showy knickerbockers characteristics all that fitted to my conception of the identity of dora forbes in a moment i saw what had happened the author of the other way round had just alighted at the portals of prestidge but had suffered a scruple to restrain him from penetrating further i recognised his scruple when pausing to listen at his gesture of caution i heard a shrill voice lifted in a sort of rhythmic uncanny chant the famous reading had begun only it was the author of obsessions who now furnished the sacrifice the new visitor whispered to me that he judged something was going on he oughtnt to interrupt miss collop arrived last night i smiled and the princess has a thirst for the inedit dora forbes lifted his bushy brows miss collop guy walsingham your distinguished confrere or shall i say your formidable rival oh growled dora forbes then he added shall i spoil it if i go in i should think nothing could spoil it i ambiguously laughed dora forbes evidently felt the dilemma he gave an irritated crook to his moustache shall i go in he presently asked we looked at each other hard a moment then i expressed something bitter that was in me expressed it in an infernal do after this i got out into the air but not so fast as not to hear when the door of the drawingroom opened the disconcerted drop of miss collops public manner she must have been in the midst of the larger latitude producing with extreme rapidity guy walsingham has just published a work in which amiable people who are not initiated have been pained to see the genius of a sisternovelist held up to unmistakeable ridicule so fresh an exhibition does it seem to them of the dreadful way men have always treated women dora forbes its true at the present hour is immensely pushed by mrs wimbush and has sat for his portrait to the young artists she protects sat for it not only in oils but in monumental alabaster what happened at prestidge later in the day is of course contemporary history if the interruption i had whimsically sanctioned was almost a scandal what is to be said of that general scatter of the company which under the doctors rule began to take place in the evening his rule was soothing to behold small comfort as i was to have at the end he decreed in the interest of his patient an absolutely soundless house and a consequent breakup of the party little country practitioner as he was he literally packed off the princess she departed as promptly as if a revolution had broken out and guy walsingham emigrated with her i was kindly permitted to remain and this was not denied even to mrs wimbush the privilege was withheld indeed from dora forbes so mrs wimbush kept her latest capture temporarily concealed this was so little however her usual way of dealing with her eminent friends that a couple of days of it exhausted her patience and she went up to town with him in great publicity the sudden turn for the worse her afflicted guest had after a brief improvement taken on the third night raised an obstacle to her seeing him before her retreat a fortunate circumstance doubtless for she was fundamentally disappointed in him this was not the kind of performance for which she had invited him to prestidge let alone invited the princess i must add that none of the generous acts marking her patronage of intellectual and other merit have done so much for her reputation as her lending neil paraday the most beautiful of her numerous homes to die in he took advantage to the utmost of the singular favour day by day i saw him sink and i roamed alone about the empty terraces and gardens his wife never came near him but i scarcely noticed it as i paced there with rage in my heart i was too full of another wrong in the event of his death it would fall to me perhaps to bring out in some charming form with notes with the tenderest editorial care that precious heritage of his written project but where was that precious heritage and were both the author and the book to have been snatched from us lady augusta wrote me that she had done all she could and that poor lord dorimont who had really been worried to death was extremely sorry i couldnt have the matter out with mrs wimbush for i didnt want to be taunted by her with desiring to aggrandise myself by a public connexion with mr paradays sweepings she had signified her willingness to meet the expense of all advertising as indeed she was always ready to do the last night of the horrible series the night before he died i put my ear closer to his pillow that thing i read you that morning you know in your garden that dreadful day yes wont it do as it is it would have been a glorious book it is a glorious book neil paraday murmured print it as it stands beautifully beautifully i passionately promised it may be imagined whether now that hes gone the promise seems to me less sacred im convinced that if such pages had appeared in his lifetime the abbey would hold him today ive kept the advertising in my own hands but the manuscript has not been recovered its impossible and at any rate intolerable to suppose it can have been wantonly destroyed perhaps some hazard of a blind hand some brutal fatal ignorance has lighted kitchenfires with it every stupid and hideous accident haunts my meditations my undiscourageable search for the lost treasure would make a long chapter fortunately ive a devoted associate in the person of a young lady who has every day a fresh indignation and a fresh idea and who maintains with intensity that the prize will still turn up sometimes i believe her but ive quite ceased to believe myself the only thing for us at all events is to go on seeking and hoping together and we should be closely united by this firm tie even were we not at present by another
