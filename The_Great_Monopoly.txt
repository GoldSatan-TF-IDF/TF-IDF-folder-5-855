the great monopoly for many years the mystery remained a dark and haunting problem it concealed a tragedy of so much we all in the end felt sure but we knew nothing if the tragedy were a crime we had no clue to the motive if an accident we could discover no trace of its occurrence the police failed to solve the mystery and we did not rest content with the inquiries of the police every possible kind of investigation was practiced without thought of the money spent for a great interest was involved nothing less in a word than the revolution of an entire industry but no hint of a solution was obtained and it was the merest chance which after the affair had been almost forgotten disclosed some part of the truth to me but however mysterious the end was to prove the beginning was commonplace enough one morning in june while i was sitting in my chambers in grays inn thinking over a series of lectures which i was to deliver next term upon the wanderings of odysseus my servant entered with a card and a letter and i read for the first time the name of reuben clinch there was an address upon the card ballarat australia i turned to the letter which was addressed to me in a handwriting vaguely familiar and tore open the envelope it was a letter of introduction written by a professor at melbourne university who had been an acquaintance of mine twenty years before when we were both undergraduates at balliol i had never liked him then i liked him less now for thrusting in upon my seclusion to speak the truth i was rather annoyed the letter described the australian as a young man of great scientific attainments and i felt that there could be no possible sympathy between such a man and myself however i could hardly refuse to see my visitor and with a sigh for my wasted morning i turned from my homer and said show mr clinch in a young man about twentysix years of age walked into the room and at once i could not but grudgingly admit to myself that i was more favorably impressed than i had thought to be mr clinch was tall and long of limb he was dark in hair and complexion and wore a little black mustache which did not take away from the singular keenness of his appearance his face was not handsome so much as significant there was power and ability in every line of it the features were sharp and extremely mobile and his eyes were steady i am afraid professor royle that i am interrupting you he said as he took my hand well mr clinch the morning is for work is it not i said a little ungraciously i am afraid i saw a look of anxiety and disappointment come into his eyes and i hastened to add but i am none the less very glad to see you i motioned him to a chair near the open window and he sat down in it i am glad to hear it he said with a smile for i know no one at all in london or indeed in england and the letter of introduction which i have brought to you is the only letter of the kind which i possess then this is your first visit i said yes he replied still looking at me with a great earnestness i felt that he was speculating upon my willingness and my ability to serve him and somehow i was impelled to say to him well i must see what i can do for you i go very little into the world myself but i can make you an honorary member of my club and reuben clinch smiled and the smile was supercilious there was suddenly revealed to me a nature masterful and rather intolerant but in a moment the contempt had gone and he was leaning forward with his hands upon his knees as though he was concentrating his mind upon persuading me to serve his turn i did not come here to enjoy myself he said quietly will you let me tell you what you can do for me certainly i replied sitting back with resignation in my study chair clinch looked out into the garden for a few moments his eyes resting upon the great leafy trees and beneath their shade the green lawns splashed with sunlight it is quiet here he said a very pleasant place for a man to work in and then he turned his eyes to me and said quietly i have made a great discovery my heart sank at the words it is of a scientific kind i presume i said wearily yes i am not well versed in scientific matters i protested but i can give you some letters to scientific men of eminence who will be a help to you reuben clinch smiled again thank you professor but i am satisfied with the results of my investigations my discovery is of a practical kind the help i want is on the commercial side then i hastened to interrupt i shall be still more useless to you are you sure he asked earnestly hear me first before you answer he learned forward impressively i have discovered how to fix the oil in wool i assure you that this is all greek to me i replied no he persisted if it were that it would be clear as daylight to you professor let me say that it is to you what greek would be to me it was a neatly turned compliment no doubt i am not more sensible to such things than other men but one could not but be pleased to know that one had a reputation even in australia the smile too with which the compliment was expressed was undoubtedly winning well tell me about your discovery i said and he began frankly the man was wonderful he had enthusiasm he had confidence and he was determined that i should listen and understand it appeared that the difficulty of fixing the oil had been the one great hindrance in the woollen industry that experts had been in vain trying to overcome it for many years at last thanks to a practical experience of sheep farming combined with a mind scientifically trained he reuben clinch had discovered the great secret the dying of cloth would be simplified the processes the machinery of the yorkshire factories would be superceded the whole industry would be revolutionized colossal fortunes would be made and prices would be lowered for the public i seemed to be listening to a great commercial epic the man was magnetic he made me see the great discovery in the great wide aspect in which it appealed to him it was a great romance which he unfolded a romance which had begun with a boy tending sheep on an upland farm of australia and was to end in the multiplication of factories and the capture of the entire worlds trade in this industry for england he stopped and said abruptly now what i want you to do for me if you can is to give me a strong introduction to a man of capital engaged in the wool trade it was astonishing with what confidence reuben clinch made his unlikely request it was still more astonishing i think that i was actually able to comply with it fortune was once more siding with the masterful for one of my few friends was a prosperous wool merchant in the city of london mr ralph speedy i knew little of the commercial side of speedys life but was aware that he held a high reputation and that his opinion was thought of value in his trade my friendship with him was due to another aspect of his character he was a man with a great reverence for the classics though with little knowledge he would quote horace upon occasion without it is true either accuracy or appositeness but with an amiable diffidence which quite prevented criticism and above all he behaved towards those fortunate few who are really scholars with a respect which i find much too rare yes i said doubtfully looking at reuben clinch i can give you such an introduction but it will be better perhaps if i first see the man i am thinking of a shade of disappointment darkened upon my visitors face you will not forget he said anxiously no i replied and if i do i think you will probably call and remind me mr clinch laughed wrote his address upon a card and went away i turned back to my homer and very quickly forgot all about clinch and his famous discovery in the afternoon however as i was taking my daily walk he recurred to my mind i wondered at the strange spell he had cast upon me i laughed at my momentary obsession as at some foolish hallucination he was probably an imposter a quack and lo all the time i was unconsciously walking not to my usual haunt on an afternoon the rooms of the british academy but down cheapside towards the city i woke to the direction of my walk when i was only a few yards from my friend speedys office since i was so near i might as well go in what said my friend genially as i entered his office you have deserted parnassus and the streams of helicon sit down i told speedy the story of my visitor and of his discovery speedy shrugged his shoulders and laughed an impostor said he it was my own thought but now that it was expressed by another man i no longer felt so sure of it something of the glamour which clinch had thrown over his subject came back to me it would be a great discovery i asked a method of fixing the oil in wool would produce this startling revolution in the industry undoubtedly said speedy but everybody has had a shot at it no one has succeeded it is a secret which will never be discovered it might be worth while seeing the man i suggested i confess that he impressed me speedy looked at me with surprise it was no doubt as strange to him as it was to me that i should be in any way interested in the subject oh he said abruptly lets go and see him now he took up his hat and we went out clinch had taken rooms in duke street st jamess and thither we drove we found him in i have brought mr speedy to see you i said clinchs face flushed with pleasure and he shook me warmly by the hand thats very kind of you professor he said i did not expect it i understood quite clearly this morning that you did not want to see me at all i was prepared to hear nothing further from you then he turned to my friend and bowed mr speedys name is of course very well known to me i could not hope for better assistance speedy did not respond with any warmth to this greeting i promise no assistance he said coldly you must first prove to me the genuineness of your discovery of course said clinch he placed chairs and we sat down then he went to a cupboard and took out two small bundles of wool these he brought across the room to us here is the natural wool he said holding out one of the bundles speedy took it and examined it and laid it aside yes he said clinch handed him the second bundle here is wool from the same clip after my treatment speedy took the second bundle and bent his head closely over it i saw his face change from its indifference he fingered the wool and examined it in every part that he was interested was clear enough but what he actually thought that was another matter his face gave us no clue and he did not speak we waited upon his decision in a great suspense i say we for indeed i believe that i was more excited than reuben clinch at last speedy put the bundle down yes he said gravely this is genuine he went to the window and stood looking out upon the street i had no doubt that the same dream which had been mine this morning was his now i did not move neither did reuben clinch but i looked at clinch he was now quite calm speedys statement was no more than he expected he was sitting quietly unconcernedly in a chair his whole attitude that of a man who knows he is right speedy turned back from the window still i make no promises he said i make you a proposition however i have a house in the country will you come down with me on friday i will then place in your hands some wool i will provide you with whatever chemical products you require or you can bring what you require yourself i will give you an empty room which you can lock if you like on the inside but you must there fix the oil in the wool i give you clinch bowed i accept the test with pleasure very well then we catch the train from waterloo to dorking on friday afternoon speedy turned to me will you come too or will it bore you no i answered eagerly i shall be very glad the experiment was entirely successful it was conducted under the strictest surveillance clinch himself insisted on being searched before he entered his room and when the finished wool was produced the last of speedys distrust vanished forever we all three traveled up to london together on monday morning and i very well remember speedy looking out through the windows upon the surrey woods and seeing nothing whatever of the foliage as we passed he was a stoutly built strong man in face and figure an impersonation of common sense but on this morning his eyes were alight clinch had thrown his spell upon him too theres a colossal fortune in this he said oh not merely for us but for all yorkshire for england we shall so simplify and economize in the cost of production not a country will be able to compete we shall hold a monopoly a monopoly in cloth in his ears too the great commercial epic was sounding loud think what that means he exclaimed think what it means i dont think it wise to go for a patent keep your secret clinch theres no fear that anyone else will hit upon it we must get bradford to come in oh it can be done there will be opposition of course but we will break that down meanwhile ill finance you speedy was quick to act once he had made up his prudent mind a house was taken furnished near to the marble arch and overlooking hyde park it was a good house and well furnished we must do the thing well said speedy no parsimony and no fireworks servants were engaged an excellent cook upon that point speedy laid the greatest stress a butler and a footman within a fortnight of the visit to dorking clinch was installed and that notable series of dinner parties began which was to prelude the revolution in the woollen industry i was present at the first which was also the smallest there were only six seated along the dinner table three leading yorkshire manufacturers speedy clinch and myself i can see that party now even after this lapse of time the big dining room with its polished mahogany its dark hangings its air of comfort the round table with its decanters and silver and pratt the burly shrewd yorkshireman leaning across the table with his cigar tilted upwards from the corner of his mouth he had one hand upon the sample of wool i remember what a contrast he made to clinch who sat opposite to him with his pale face dark eyes and rather supercilious air who knows how the things done asked pratt how many are in the secret only myself answered clinch lets see said pratt he looked towards me and looked away again you no you dont but speedy what of you eh i only know the secret clinch repeated i will explain to you now threequarters of the process the other quarter i keep to myself until you come into the scheme thats fair said pratt i will confess to you that the threequarters will be of no help to any man who does not know the rest it seemed to me a dangerous plan but i looked at clinch he had no hesitation no fear he leaned back in his chair perfectly secure that no one of his hearers would penetrate his secret he explained the process while those about listened keenly to very word he explained it with a deliberation which was almost careless i of course could not understand a word but i understood from the faces of the others about the dinner table that the scheme was being comprehended and thought good clinch stopped another word and the cats out of the bag he said i stop here gentlemen very well said pratt he had let his cigar go out he threw it into the grate and lighted another i speak for myself he went on the things good enough for me im in speedy pratts opinion carried weight and his two companions followed him this dinner took place in july the summer holidays were coming on and i think only one more such party took place before the early autumn i am not quite sure for i left london myself and traveled to greece in order to follow by sea and land the actual wanderings of odysseus the hot weather gave me fever i was delayed in my undertaking and i only returned to town in november just in time to deliver the first of my lectures it was in the secondweek of that month that i was again present at a dinner party in the house by the marble arch as i entered the room i saw that matters had progressed there were quite twenty people present most of them so far as i could gather from the conversation which went on about me the smaller bradford manufacturers speedy sat next to me and i asked him how things were going finely he replied we are going to effect a great combination the public announcement will be made in less than a month you see and he looked round the table we have already come to the smaller fry they must come in or be crushed out of the trade altogether the dinner was in most respects a copy of those which had gone before the samples of wool were sent round and examined some portion of the process was explained and questions were invited by clinch one difference i noticed there seemed more anxiety on the part of the questioners to know what would be the actual cost of the alterations they would have immediately to make in their businesses and factories than to estimate the subsequent profits which would follow when the process was in use they seem to be niggling i said to speedy they are the small men you see said speedy the party broke up rather late it was past twelve when speedy and i who had remained to the last took leave of clinch he came through the hall to the door with us and glanced up at the clock as he passed it i wont ask you to stay on tonight he said goodbye that was the last i was ever to see of clinch no i am wrong the night was mild and speedy walked with me a little of my way along oxford street we had gone perhaps a quarter of a mile when a man came up behind us passed us and walked quickly on ahead he was evidently wearing evening dress and a light overcoat above it i clutched speedy by the arm surely thats clinch i said is it where i pointed out the man who was now some distance in front i had not seen anything of his face so that i was not certain it looks like him certainly said speedy but one cant be certain and anyhow its no business of ours at the next corner speedy jumped into a hansom and drove back westwards to his home i got into an omnibus and jolted along to grays inn thither three mornings later speedy came to me he was terribly agitated he refused to sit down and paced the room in the greatest distress what do you think he exclaimed clinch has disappeared i started up from my chair disappeared yes vanished completely theres not a trace of him not a clue to his whereabouts nothing absolutely nothing at once just for a second my old suspicion flashed across my mind was clinch an impostor i asked myself and i only asked the question to dismiss it i did not utter it aloud when did he disappear i said three nights ago you remember we dined at the house i uttered a cry it was he then who passed us in oxford street no doubt of it said speedy the butler told me that he left the house immediately after he was free of us why didnt we stop him he dropped into a chair the very chair in which clinch had sat in the early summer when he paid me his first visit oh why didnt we stop him he repeated he was wringing his hands like a woman in distress you know why we didnt stop him i replied speedy lifted his head and answered yes are you sure there was no love affair speedy knitted his forehead over that problem and then he cried out in despair i dont know he never opened out did he no i replied but there might be letters in the house theres nothing absolutely nothing i have been at the house all the morning not one of the servants knows a thing theres not the merest scrap of writing that will give us any help when did you first hear that he had disappeared i asked two days ago thats the fatal thing i have lost two days and if its he paused for a second as though he feared to speak the words even to himself if its foul play the loss of those two days may just stop us from ever finding him lets get into a hansom he put his hat on his head helped me into my overcoat and hurried me out of the room we went down into the grays inn road and hailed a hansom scotland yard cried speedy and as quick as you can he was in a fever keep a lookout on your side royle he said while i talk to you ill look out on mine one of us might see him not much hope but we mustnt miss a chance you see there has been some sort of an affair i know who she is what she is whether she is any particular one i dont know but clinch has gone away before only he has never stayed away he has disappeared only he has come back again thats why i have lost two days i thought he would come back until this morning he may have eloped i suggested as the cab turned down chancery lane i have thought of that but would he exclaimed speedy would he with all this colossal future waiting for him i dont know these quiet secret men you never know but i am afraid of something else of what of one of those queer accident things which strike a man down just as he is coming into his kingdom i had never seen speedy so moved i would not have believed it possible that he could have been so moved by the loss of anyone who was not very dear to him but clinch had thrown his spell upon us both here we are speedy cried as the cab stopped we told our story to the inspector and as he listened i noticed that a smile of amusement struggled into his impassive face oh i know what you are thinking said speedy you are thinking that clinch has fooled us that he is an impostor and has done a bolt but thats not true i know very well what i am talking about his process was perfectly genuine he must have made a huge fortune if he had stayed here he took all the details which we could give him down in a book and as he wrote them down i realized how meagre they were the house in the bayswater road was searched from floor to ceiling we waited with a lingering hope for a month for two months for three the police could discover nothing clinch had disappeared he carried with him his secret no one knew the last process by which the oil was fixed the house by the marble arch was given up and the great monopoly of cloth became once more a dream speculation was rife as to the reason of clinchs disappearance the view which gained most adherents held that he had been lured on that night of his last dinner into some foul den and then murdered for what he had upon his person but thirteen years later i learned the truth i was crossing westminster bridge one november evening about six oclock on my way to waterloo station it was an evening of fog although the fog was not dense as i passed beneath a lamp post there came out of the fog towards me a man whom i seemed dimly to recognize then he passed on i walked slowly on my way for a few paces trying to recollect where i had seen his face i stopped again automatically and looked back i saw the man had stopped too just as i had and was looking after me as i was looking after him i turned and walked towards him slowly it seemed to me reluctantly he in his turn came towards me as we met he touched his hat i seem to know your face i said yes sir he replied you are professor royle i was butler to poor mr clinch over there at the marble arch at once i remembered the story had grown rather dim to me by this time but the butlers words revived it vividly yes i said that was sad the butler nodded his head yes sir and he added you were dining at the house on the night when mr clinch was murdered murdered i exclaimed are you sure of that he disappeared that is all we know oh yes sir he was murdered the butler persisted i know well then he looked around him its so very long since sir that ill tell you how i know that evening as the gentlemen were leaving i helped two of them on with their coats they took no notice of me they were thinking of other things i heard one say that means ruin to us you know and i heard the other reply it would mean ruin but it will never come off youll see i didnt take much notice of the words at the time sir but i remembered them afterwards i remembered too that they were spoken with a great deal of conviction but why on earth didnt you come forward and say that at the time i asked the man shuffled his feet well sir i didnt remember the names of the gentlemen i didnt see what good it would do mr clinch having gone and and well i told my wife about it and she said hold your tongue it wont do you any good to be mixed up in it and upon that the butler touched his hat again and disappeared into the fog i remembered now that that party was a party of the small men i recollected how the conversation had run on the cost of the alterations consequent upon the revolution of the trade once the process was adopted and this is clear the great monopoly which was so to help england was stopped by a crime and the crime was committed by one of the smaller men who was likely to go under in the process of change
