chapter one the stranger i dont usually pick up hitchhikers but this one was different he wasnt young like the others and he didnt have a bag or a girlfriend or a sign with london or lancaster on it he just stood there beside the road with his hand out waiting he was a man about forty years old in a grey suit and red tie he was just watching the cars and waiting he was watching me while i slowed down i remember his eyes very pale blue eyes staring at me through thin gold glasses they looked surprised perhaps i was something strange something not quite real to him or perhaps he just had bad eyes perhaps he couldnt see very well i stopped the car and opened the window where are you going i asked im going into town he said into lancaster could you give me a lift please yes ok i said im going that way jump in he got in and sat down beside me thank you very much he said its very kind of you thats all right i said its my pleasure i started the car and thought about the words he had used there was something strange about them hitchhikers dont usually speak like that they usually say something like are you going to lancaster oh good thanks a lot he spoke politely like an older man but this man wasnt very old perhaps hes foreign i thought i looked at him and noticed something else could you put your seatbelt on please i said he looked at me im all right he said i dont like seatbelts very much i feel like a prisoner in the car its the law you know and im a police sergeant so i think you should wear one in my car oh yes im so sorry the law yes yes i forgot he looked around him but for a moment he couldnt find the seatbelt its there behind you i said you do it like this i helped him to put on the seatbelt yes thank you he said im terribly sorry i never remember these things oh really i said why dont you have a car no not now i dont like them i did have one once but that was a long time ago for a moment i thought he would continue but then he stopped talking and stared quietly out of the window i looked at him again im a police officer so its my job to look at people and to think carefully about them i was sure there was something strange about this man his hair nobody has their hair cut quite like that now and that suit it was quite clean quite new but the trousers and lapels were wider than they usually are where had i seen a suit like that before do you live near here i asked i was still wondering about him was he a foreigner he smiled at me i live in lancaster in the centre of the town in fact i was listening carefully he speaks very good english i thought he speaks in the local way i dont think he is a foreigner but that face its the middle of summer now and weve had a lot of sun this year why is he so pale what sort of job do you do i asked he smiled at me again oh i dont have a job at the moment he said thats why i dont have a car now you see you havent driven for a long time then i said he looked at me again that same quiet surprised look no i havent he said not for a long time i smiled at him i thought you hadnt i said youve had to wear seatbelts in a car for many years sorry i continued its my job police officers always play at detectives yes i see he said he smiled a quiet polite smile was on his mouth but those pale eyes were still and empty then for a moment i stopped thinking about him because there was a lot of traffic on the road cars were moving very slowly and i saw a policeman in front with several police cars and flashing blue lights i knew the policeman so i stopped the car beside him whats the matter john i asked its an accident sue he said one car stopped suddenly and another car went into the back of it anyone hurt three people i think but they dont look too bad the ambulance will be here soon do you need any help i wasnt in uniform but i had to ask he thought for a moment and i heard the sound of the ambulance it was coming towards us well it looks quite nasty but well be ok when the ambulance comes sue there are two police cars here already but you can ask the sergeant over there if you like hell know all right john thanks i drove on slowly to the accident there was glass all over the road and the two damaged cars were by the side of the road on the left it seemed that one car had hit the back of the other and pushed it off the road a young girl was sitting at the side of the road with a policeman her face was covered in blood a man was lying on the ground beside the second car and another policeman was kneeling beside him the sergeant was talking to the driver of the first car who was still in his seat chapter two an accident i parked the car got out and went over to the man on the ground is there anything i can do i asked the policeman he looked up surprised and then he recognized me oh its you sue i think hes ok hes breathing and his hearts fine but i dont like the look of that leg one of the mans legs was broken in two places it looked like there were two knees he was breathing but his eyes were closed and his face was very white can you go and help chris with the little girl he said i think this man is her father i looked at the little girl she was trying to walk but she seemed confused the policeman was holding her arm i went over and knelt in front of her there was blood all over her face i couldnt see her eyes very well hello i said my names sue im a police officer can you see me she wiped her face with her hand and nodded good i said whats your name kate kate ok kate you heard that sound just now didnt you that was the ambulance this policeman chris and i are going to take you over to the ambulance and then the ambulance men will take you to the hospital and look after you youre going to be all right but what about my daddy hell come with you in the ambulance hes going to be all right too i held one of the girls arms and chris held the other we took the little girl over to the ambulance and sat talking with her while the ambulance men lifted her father and the other driver into the ambulance when the ambulance had gone i spoke to the sergeant for a few minutes what happened i asked i dont know yet he said i think the first car stopped suddenly but i cant think why still thats something that well have to find out its a funny place for an accident i can only remember one here before about twenty years ago i think it was that was a nasty one too a young man was killed run over by a car i remember that a little child was hurt then too what happened then he shook his head i cant remember now anyway this onell be your job in the morning im on holiday next week remember thanks for your help on the way back to the car i could see one of the policemen he was picking up the little girls doll from the side of the road he walked over and put it in the police car chapter three a frightened passenger when i got back into the car the hitchhiker was still there he did look very strange for a moment i thought he was crying im sorry he said but i hate accidents were were they badly hurt i looked at him quickly his face was very pale and were his hands shaking quite badly i said one had a broken leg and the young girl had a lot of glass in her face but i think theyll live oh good i im sorry i didnt get out but you see i hate seeing blood i smiled thats all right i dont like it either but im a police officer its my job yes i suppose you see a lot of accidents quite a lot yes but its funny ive never seen one here before the roads very straight and it was clear of traffic and its not dark or anything a car stopped suddenly and another car hit it its very strange for a moment my passenger didnt answer he just looked straight in front of him the grey eyes in the pale face staring at the road and the traffic then he said very quietly cars do terrible things dont they i hate cars i hate them i didnt say anything for a minute then i asked him if he had a family in lancaster yes i have one son hes at the university you know id been there just now before you picked me up oh really does he like it there yes i think so yes he likes it very much he smiled at me the same grey pale smile but i still have to look after him you know he does silly things and gets into lots of trouble he needs me you know im sure hed have an accident if i didnt keep an eye on him all the time that was a very strange thing to say about a son at university my sister is at the university too but i dont think my father knows what shes doing every day i dont think he wants to know and im quite sure she doesnt want her father keeping an eye on her all the time but before i could say anything else we had reached the centre of the town i stopped the car outside the cemetery if you want the centre of the town this is the best place i said im driving home after this this is perfect he opened the door carefully and got out thank you very much youre very kind my pleasure i watched him walk away a short pale man in that strange oldfashioned suit then i drove out into the traffic and forgot about him chapter four wheres the body next morning i found the reports of the car accident on my desk there were photographs of the two cars after the crash and a plan of the area the two cars had been drawn on the plan the police had also spoken to two students they had been walking beside the road at the time of the accident the students had both seen the first car swerve suddenly in front of the second car and then stop for no reason but the police hadnt spoken to the drivers of the two cars because they were too ill so i had to go to the hospital to talk to them pc brian jones came with me the doctors said we couldnt talk to the driver of the second car or the little girl so we went to see the driver of the first car he was sitting up in bed he could talk now but he had hurt his neck quite badly because the car had stopped very quickly but it seemed that he didnt want to say much good morning mr jackson i said im a police sergeant the doctor tells me youre feeling much better this morning a bit he said but i still cant move my neck if you want to talk to me sit on the end of the bed and then i can see you i sat on the end of the bed and looked at him he was about thirty years old with a thin brown face a small moustache and dark hair he looked very unhappy and his eyes always looked away from me when he spoke i suppose you want to know about the accident he asked thats right mr jackson can you remember anything about it remember it yes of course i can ive been thinking about it all night but it wasnt my fault honestly you must believe me i was driving along quite slowly about fortyfive miles an hour i think or maybe fifty but no more really anyway theres no special speed limit on that road is there only the limit for normal roads you can go up to sixty miles an hour well i wasnt driving as fast as that i was driving quite slowly the road was clear and i hadnt been drinking in fact i never drink and drive never im sure the doctors tested that didnt they officer i looked at my notes yes i think so it doesnt say anything here about alcohol mr jackson so it couldnt be my fault could it i mean i was going at a normal speed slowly even on a sunny day and i hadnt been drinking and then there he was right in front of me i felt confused im sorry mr jackson i dont understand who was in front of you he stared at me strangely well the man of course the man who was killed now i was really confused what im sorry mr jackson but no one was killed the people in the other car were hurt but theyre both alive one has a broken leg i think and the little girl hurt her face but thats all which car asked mr jackson the car that hit you from behind now mr jackson looked confused he looked even more unhappy and his face went white as white as the bandage round his neck do you mean are you telling me that a car hit me from behind officer yes he put his hands to his neck he had been trying to shake his head but he couldnt i dont remember that he said you dont remember anything about a car that hit you from behind no nothing and you say there were two people in it a man and a girl oh how terrible he began to cry and took a handkerchief from the table beside his bed i thought carefully lets start from the beginning mr jackson you say you were driving along slowly about fortyfive miles an hour is that right then what happened think carefully and tell me slowly he put the handkerchief down and stared at me his eyes big and wide well then i saw him thats all a man he was running across the road in front of me he didnt look where he was going or anything he was just there suddenly i tried to stop but it was too late poor man i couldnt miss him i waited until he had finished the nurse gave him a drink of water then i asked quietly mr jackson do you remember anything about this man i mean what did he look like he looked at me strangely well i didnt have much time did i i suppose he was about forty or fifty years old in a suit or something i dont know his face was very white i suppose that was because he was frightened i think he had glasses on and there was something red perhaps it was a tie or maybe it was the blood i dont know but why does it matter youve got the body havent you you know who he is i looked at pc jones this mans crazy i thought perhaps he has hurt his head too i felt sorry for him i spoke very slowly and carefully i tried to make my voice as kind as i could mr jackson we havent found a body no one was killed in the accident you didnt hit anyone you just stopped your car suddenly and the car behind ran into you thats all but does that mean youre going to prosecute me he asked im not sure yet mr jackson i said we havent finished our investigations but im afraid the police usually prosecute people for dangerous driving if they stop suddenly for no reason but you cant do that id lose my job im a salesman i drive hundreds of miles every week and nobody can work for our company if they have been prosecuted for dangerous driving thats why i never drink and drive never and i never stop without a good reason there was a man there in front of me i told you i saw him as clearly as i can see you now well im sorry mr jackson i said but there was a serious accident and at the moment it seems it was your fault thats all i can say for now chapter five the doctor explains outside the room the nurse stopped us could you both wait in here a moment please she said i think the doctor would like to speak to you we heard the nurse talking to the doctor outside the room for two or three minutes and then the doctor came in she smiled at me good morning sergeant fraser she said to me youve been talking to mr jackson havent you yes i said poor man hes not very happy im afraid no of course not said the doctor well it was a nasty accident wasnt it and hes hurt his neck quite badly but the rest of him is ok he should be out of hospital in a few days yes i looked at the doctor carefully doctor are you sure that he hasnt hurt anything else his head perhaps you see i dont think he remembers the accident very well he thinks he killed somebody who walked in front of the car but he didnt nobody was killed nobody walked in front of the car and he doesnt remember the second car at all yes i know she said i wanted to talk to you about that of course people do forget accidents thats normal they often dont remember anything about them so im not surprised that he doesnt remember the second car but its very unusual to remember something that didnt happen she stopped for a moment and looked at me thoughtfully so i thought perhaps i shouldnt say this but i thought you should know last night this man had a small problem with his heart a very unusual problem for a few minutes it beat very slowly it nearly stopped and then it started again and people who have a heart problem like that arent usually allowed to drive you know because they might become ill for a couple of minutes and then of course a car would stop suddenly i see i said so you think that perhaps he had a small heart attack yesterday too i dont know she said maybe he had the attack because of the accident i havent seen his doctors records so i dont know if he has ever had this problem before i see i said well thank you doctor thats very helpful chapter six a good explanation that explains it then said brian jones as we drove back to the police station there wasnt a man in front of his car and he knows it i mean if the man did have this heart problem then he couldnt have a job as a salesman could he he wouldnt have a driving license and hed lose his job and hes very afraid of losing his job isnt he he told us that yes i said but that doesnt explain his story does it well yes maybe it does sergeant he said look at it this way perhaps this man had a problem with his heart several years ago and then he got better so he got his driving license back his job and his driving license are very important to him so he always drives very very carefully he never drinks and drives or does anything silly and why is he so very very careful because hes always afraid that one day his heart problem will come back and then hell lose his license his job and everything then yesterday it did come back and so he had this accident but he wants us to believe that it wasnt his fault so he has invented a story about a man who ran in front of the car only it isnt a very good story thats all because there wasnt a man and there isnt a body brian jones smiled at me he is a young clever policeman and he was very pleased with himself it was a good explanation too i couldnt see anything wrong with it back at the police station i checked everything carefully but no one had found a body no one had seen a man who ran across the road i looked at the front of mr jacksons car carefully with one of the police scientists there were no marks on it at all only the back of his car was damaged where the car behind had hit it either mr jackson was mad or he was lying but i felt sad and a little angry too the doctor at the hospital had been very helpful but why had she told us about mr jacksons heart problem that was wrong i wouldnt want my doctor to tell people about me when i was ill mr jacksons story was crazy but i really think that he believed it in my job you know when people are lying and i thought mr jackson was telling the truth chapter seven simon i talked about it with my boyfriend simon at dinner that night simon is a reporter so he has to be very careful he must never write about anything i tell him in his newspaper if he did i would lose my job but we still talk about things and sometimes it is very useful i told him about the accident and mr jacksons story he looked at me thoughtfully its a strange place for an accident isnt it he said the roads very straight there thats right i said no one ever stops there i only stopped because i for a moment i stopped talking my fork in my hand sue sue whats the matter simon said simon thats it ive remembered the thing that worries me about all this the hitchhiker what the hitchhiker the man jackson described pale face suit glasses red tie there was a man like that in my car quickly i told simon about the man that i had picked up before i saw the accident yes but he wasnt dead sue he was in your car quite safe and you picked him up a long way away from the accident not very far away about half a kilometre perhaps the traffic was moving very slowly because of the accident maybe he walked there its possible you mean perhaps the hitchhiker was walking across the road and jackson saw him stopped his car and then the other car hit jacksons car yes thats right and then the hitchhiker ran on down the road and then i picked him up simon i have to find that man simon looked thoughtful yes but wait a minute sue why would the hitchhiker cross the road there theres nothing there and anyway if he was walking towards you he was walking away from town not towards it i shook my head i dont know but i want to find him he said he lived in lancaster and another thing simon one of the older police sergeants said there had once been an accident on that road before something about a child i think it was about twenty years ago maybe more can you check in your old newspapers and find out about it i think it may help simon groaned you want me to check the records for a little thing like that do you know how long that takes i smiled at him but youll do it for me wont you simon i said please chapter eight flowers on a grave it took simon a long time but he found the newspaper story in the end we met for lunch in the park in the middle of town and he took it out of his pocket he showed it to me and i read it carefully a small yellow piece of paper a newspaper story about a road accident eighteen years ago father killed in road crash son saved by brave dad a man was hit by a car and killed in an accident on the main road outside lancaster yesterday police said the man twentyfiveyearold mr david holland ran straight in front of the car the car driver had no time to stop and mr holland was killed immediately a threeyearold boy mr hollands son michael was found by the side of the road crying a woman mrs helen steadman was walking with her dog by the side of the road mrs steadman said that mr holland had been driving towards lancaster with his son just before the accident he had stopped his car by the side of the road and both of them had got out i think perhaps the little boy wanted to go to the toilet mrs steadman said but before his father could stop him he ran straight out across the road in front of the traffic mr holland ran after him and managed to pick up the little boy and throw him to the side of the road but then a car hit the father it wasnt the drivers fault the little boy ran straight out into the road without looking and his father ran out after him then i ran to catch the little boy before he could go back into the road again the police said that mr holland was dead when they arrived he will be buried in lancaster cemetery on tuesday the little boys mother died a year ago so he will live with his grandparents in carnforth this is the first accident that anyone can remember on this part of the road the road is very straight there and is usually very safe the police do not think the car driver was driving fast i put down the old yellow piece of paper and thought for a minute eighteen years ago a man had run in front of a car and been killed on the same part of the road and yesterday there had been another accident and the driver of the first car mr jackson was quite sure that he had seen a man who had run out in front of him and was also sure that he had hit him in exactly the same way its interesting isnt it simon said but it doesnt help much does it have you found your hitchhiker yet no i said ive checked all our police records and we have no records of anyone who looks like him and of course he didnt tell me his name i see said simon strangely there is one other interesting thing that i havent told you oh whats that well every day i walk through the cemetery on my way to work i know the place quite well sometimes i sit and have my sandwiches there at lunchtime and so i notice the other people who come there the people who put flowers on the graves and eat their lunch there sometimes i even read the gravestones you know i often wonder about them what were the people like how long did they live its very interesting in your lunch hour how strange i said do you think so i like it its quiet and peaceful there so i can think and read anyway theres one grave there that always has flowers on it a young man comes to put them there hes a student i think and when i read this newspaper story i knew id seen the name holland somewhere before at first i couldnt remember the place that id seen it then i remembered its the name on this gravestone david holland i checked this morning because i wanted to be certain and the date on the stone was the same too its the same man who was killed in the accident so i asked whats surprising about that it isnt surprising that he was buried there he came from lancaster and i suppose that the young man who brings the flowers is his son that would be normal wouldnt it maybe he said but not every day not after eighteen years anyway the cemetery is just over there why dont we go and have a look we can go that way back to the car ok if you like i didnt know that you were so interested in gravestones simon we got up and walked quietly through the park and into the cemetery it was a nice sunny summer afternoon neither of us wanted to hurry back to work there it is look simon pointed and i saw a grave just like all the others there were a few red flowers on it we walked towards it but then a young man came past us on the path he knelt down beside the grave he took the old flowers away and put some fresh ones beside it we stopped a few metres away and watched the young man stayed very quietly beside the grave for several minutes i could see his mouth moving it seemed that he was talking to someone hes praying simon i said come on lets go we shouldnt stand and watch him ok he said and we moved slowly away but dont you think its strange he asked while we were getting into the car i mean his father has been dead for about twenty years and this young man comes here nearly every day with fresh flowers and prays beside the grave yes i suppose it is i said but thats his business not ours and it doesnt help me with this accident come on lets go chapter nine an unhappy man liter that afternoon i had to meet mr jackson i didnt want to but i had to he came into my office unhappily and sat down in front of me he still had a bandage around his neck good afternoon mr jackson i said im sorry but i have investigated this accident very carefully now and i will have to prosecute you for dangerous driving his face went white and i could see his hands begin to shake but ill lose my job he said you know that dont you yes i said i understand that and im very sorry but your car swerved and stopped suddenly for no reason and two people were badly hurt in the other car they were lucky you nearly killed them but what about the man he shouted i told you i saw a man he crossed the road in front of me im not crazy you know i saw him i know i said and i think you believe it yourself but weve looked for that man and we cant find him two students saw the accident from the side of the road you know but they didnt see a man who crossed the road either im sorry mr jackson but nobody else saw this man only you perhaps your doctor can explain it but i cant his hands were shaking even more now and for a moment he couldnt speak perhaps hes going to have a heart attack now i thought here in this room after a moment he stood up and walked to the door at the door he turned and stared at me you he began youre wrong im not mad you know and im not ill either you wait one day youll see something like this and no one will believe you either then youll know how i feel he walked out shutting the door loudly behind him chapter ten the return that saturday i had to go to the university my younger sister elisabeth had just finished her studies and she was getting her degree my parents had come to watch and we were all going out for a meal afterwards i put on a nice dress after work and went to the university when i got there we sat and watched and listened and then everyone had tea outside on the grass it was a funny day all the students were wearing good clothes instead of their normal jeans and tshirts and they all took their parents round to meet their friends and their friends parents everyone was standing there talking to strangers and feeling a little embarrassed i was just getting myself another cup of tea when i saw him he was standing there with a cup of tea in his hand and a silly smile on his face the hitchhiker i stood quite still and watched him he was standing in a group with two young men students and two older people they talked and smiled for a few minutes and then the hitchhiker and one of the students moved away and began to talk to another family group that student is his son i thought and i know him too hes the young man we saw in the cemetery the hitchhiker was still very pale and he was still wearing that oldfashioned suit i noticed another strange thing too none of the other parents talked to him in fact one man nearly walked straight into him but i didnt think much about that then i knew that i had to talk to him perhaps he could help me about the accident even now i smiled and walked towards him hello i said i didnt think that id see you again he turned quickly and for a moment i was sure he was afraid or perhaps i was the first person who had spoken to him that afternoon but then he smiled too how nice he said youre the lady who gave me a lift into town a week ago arent you so he remembered me too that was interesting he looked worried but youre a policewoman arent you so you cant be a student and youre not old enough to be a parent so why are you here has there been a crime no i said my sisters getting her degree thats all is this your son yes he said michael come and meet my policewoman friend she gave me a lift in her car the other day michael smiled and shook my hand but i thought he looked a little nervous that er that was very kind of you he said my father doesnt have a car and hes always missing the bus he never manages to catch the bus if i dont take him to the busstop myself i didnt know what to say if hes the young man we saw in the cemetery i thought then his fathers dead but he says this man is his father the father smiled again these young people he said they think they know everything but really its my son whos always getting into trouble i have to look after him all the time you know people were beginning to go home i remembered that the hitchhiker didnt have a car can i give you another lift back into town i asked yes please he said that would be very kind i im getting old you know i get tired when i see too many people the son smiled and left us we walked to the car i didnt speak much i was thinking hard what questions should i ask the hitchhiker got into the car and smiled at me i hope we wont see another accident he said i hate accidents all my life ive been afraid of cars im so glad that michael isnt going to work near cars or roads hes got a job in a bookshop you know and hell be able to walk to work you cant be farther away from cars than that yes i said it didnt sound very exciting to me is this job in lancaster oh yes of course the man smiled his thin pale smile he doesnt want to work anywhere else he comes to see me every day you know when i met you the other day where had you been i asked with michael of course he said at the university how did you get there i walked it was a nice day did you cross the road about ten minutes before you met me i asked did you walk in front of a car perhaps he looked surprised and unhappy no no of course i didnt are you sure quite sure because the driver of one of the cars saw you you know saw me what do you mean one of the drivers in that accident saw a man just like you who walked straight across the road in front of him thats why he swerved and stopped he thought hed killed you the mans fingers were playing nervously with the seatbelt and his face was whiter than ever oh no that isnt true i was very careful and anyway nobody can see me when so you did cross the road we were near the centre of the town now just outside the cemetery i stopped the car and turned to look at the man more closely i think youd better come back to the police station with me ive got a few more questions to ask mr but then i remembered i still didnt know his name its er david david holland he said he was still playing nervously with the seatbelt while he spoke but im afraid i cant come to the police station thank you for the lift i must go now goodbye i tried to stop him but he was going already going in a way that was not normal at all he had not opened the door but his leg and half of his body were already halfway through it i couldnt speak i was too surprised and as i watched the other parts of his body that thin pale body in the strange oldfashioned clothes went through the door as well through the door right through the steel car door and then he walked quickly away and walked straight through the closed metal gate into the cemetery i didnt see where he went i was too shocked to move when at last i got out of the car and walked into the cemetery he was not there but there were fresh flowers on the grave under the gravestone that said david holland he gave his life for his son i stood by the grave and thought for a long time but im only an ordinary policewoman i cant arrest dead people or people who arent there i remembered the things poor mr jackson had said to me when he left my office and i wondered what on earth i was going to do now the end
