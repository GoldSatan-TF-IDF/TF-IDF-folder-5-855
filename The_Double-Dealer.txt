the doubledealer sir i heartily wish this play were as perfect as i intended it that it might be more worthy your acceptance and that my dedication of it to you might be more becoming that honour and esteem which i with everybody who is so fortunate as to know you have for you it had your countenance when yet unknown and now it is made public it wants your protection i would not have anybody imagine that i think this play without its faults for i am conscious of several i confess i designed whatever vanity or ambition occasioned that design to have written a true and regular comedy but i found it an undertaking which put me in mind of sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem and now to make amends for the vanity of such a design i do confess both the attempt and the imperfect performance yet i must take the boldness to say i have not miscarried in the whole for the mechanical part of it is regular that i may say with as little vanity as a builder may say he has built a house according to the model laid down before him or a gardener that he has set his flowers in a knot of such or such a figure i designed the moral first and to that moral i invented the fable and do not know that i have borrowed one hint of it anywhere i made the plot as strong as i could because it was single and i made it single because i would avoid confusion and was resolved to preserve the three unities of the drama sir this discourse is very impertinent to you whose judgment much better can discern the faults than i can excuse them and whose good nature like that of a lover will find out those hidden beauties if there are any such which it would be great immodesty for me to discover i think i dont speak improperly when i call you a lover of poetry for it is very well known she has been a very kind mistress to you she has not denied you the last favour and she has been fruitful to you in a most beautiful issue if i break off abruptly here i hope everybody will understand that it is to avoid a commendation which as it is your due would be most easy for me to pay and too troublesome for you to receive i have since the acting of this play harkened after the objections which have been made to it for i was conscious where a true critic might have put me upon my defence i was prepared for the attack and am pretty confident i could have vindicated some parts and excused others and where there were any plain miscarriages i would most ingenuously have confessed em but i have not heard anything said sufficient to provoke an answer that which looks most like an objection does not relate in particular to this play but to all or most that ever have been written and that is soliloquy therefore i will answer it not only for my own sake but to save others the trouble to whom it may hereafter be objected i grant that for a man to talk to himself appears absurd and unnatural and indeed it is so in most cases but the circumstances which may attend the occasion make great alteration it oftentimes happens to a man to have designs which require him to himself and in their nature cannot admit of a confidant such for certain is all villainy and other less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be communicated to a second person in such a case therefore the audience must observe whether the person upon the stage takes any notice of them at all or no for if he supposes any one to be by when he talks to himself it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree nay not only in this case but in any part of a play if there is expressed any knowledge of an audience it is insufferable but otherwise when a man in soliloquy reasons with himself and pros and cons and weighs all his designs we ought not to imagine that this man either talks to us or to himself he is only thinking and thinking such matter as were inexcusable folly in him to speak but because we are concealed spectators of the plot in agitation and the poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole mystery of his contrivance he is willing to inform us of this persons thoughts and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of speech no other better way being yet invented for the communication of thought another very wrong objection has been made by some who have not taken leisure to distinguish the characters the hero of the play as they are pleased to call him meaning mellefont is a gull and made a fool and cheated is every man a gull and a fool that is deceived at that rate im afraid the two classes of men will be reduced to one and the knaves themselves be at a loss to justify their title but if an openhearted honest man who has an entire confidence in one whom he takes to be his friend and whom he has obliged to be so and who to confirm him in his opinion in all appearance and upon several trials has been so if this man be deceived by the treachery of the other must he of necessity commence fool immediately only because the other has proved a villain ay but there was caution given to mellefont in the first act by his friend careless of what nature was that caution only to give the audience some light into the character of maskwell before his appearance and not to convince mellefont of his treachery for that was more than careless was then able to do he never knew maskwell guilty of any villainy he was only a sort of man which he did not like as for his suspecting his familiarity with my lady touchwood let em examine the answer that mellefont makes him and compare it with the conduct of maskwells character through the play i would beg em again to look into the character of maskwell before they accuse mellefont of weakness for being deceived by him for upon summing up the enquiry into this objection it may be found they have mistaken cunning in one character for folly in another but there is one thing at which i am more concerned than all the false criticisms that are made upon me and that is some of the ladies are offended i am heartily sorry for it for i declare i would rather disoblige all the critics in the world than one of the fair sex they are concerned that i have represented some women vicious and affected how can i help it it is the business of a comic poet to paint the vices and follies of humankind and there are but two sexes male and female men and women which have a title to humanity and if i leave one half of them out the work will be imperfect i should be very glad of an opportunity to make my compliment to those ladies who are offended but they can no more expect it in a comedy than to be tickled by a surgeon when hes letting em blood they who are virtuous or discreet should not be offended for such characters as these distinguish them and make their beauties more shining and observed and they who are of the other kind may nevertheless pass for such by seeming not to be displeased or touched with the satire of this comedy thus have they also wrongfully accused me of doing them a prejudice when i have in reality done them a service you will pardon me sir for the freedom i take of making answers to other people in an epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you but since i intend the play to be so too i hope i may take the more liberty of justifying it where it is in the right i must now sir declare to the world how kind you have been to my endeavours for in regard of what was well meant you have excused what was ill performed i beg you would continue the same method in your acceptance of this dedication i know no other way of making a return to that humanity you shewed in protecting an infant but by enrolling it in your service now that it is of age and come into the world therefore be pleased to accept of this as an acknowledgment of the favour you have shewn me and an earnest of the real service and gratitude of sir your most obliged humble servant william congreve to my dear friend mr congreve on his comedy called the doubledealer well

are acquainted with the secret of my aunt touchwoods violent passion for me since my first refusal of her addresses she has endeavoured to do me all ill offices with my uncle yet has managed em with that subtilty that to him they have borne the face of kindness while her malice like a dark lanthorn only shone upon me where it was directed still it gave me less perplexity to prevent the success of her displeasure than to avoid the importunities of her love and of two evils i thought myself favoured in her aversion but whether urged by her despair and the short prospect of time she saw to accomplish her designs whether the hopes of revenge or of her love terminated in the view of this my marriage with cynthia i know not but this morning she surprised me in my bed care was there ever such a fury tis well nature has not put it into her sexs power to ravish well bless us proceed what followed mel what at first amazed me for i looked to have seen her in all the transports of a slighted and revengeful woman but when i expected thunder from her voice and lightning in her eyes i saw her melted into tears and hushed into a sigh it was long before either of us spoke passion had tied her tongue and amazement mine in short the consequence was thus she omitted nothing that the most violent love could urge or tender words express which when she saw had no effect but still i pleaded honour and nearness of blood to my uncle then came the storm i feared at first for starting from my bedside like a fury she flew to my sword and with much ado i prevented her doing me or herself a mischief having disarmed her in a gust of passion she left me and in a resolution confirmed by a thousand curses not to close her eyes till they had seen my ruin care exquisite woman but what the devil does she think thou hast no more sense than to get an heir upon her body to disinherit thyself for as i take it this settlement upon you is with a proviso that your uncle have no children mel it is so well the service you are to do me will be a pleasure to yourself i must get you to engage my lady plyant all this evening that my pious aunt may not work her to her interest and if you chance to secure her to yourself you may incline her to mine shes handsome and knows it is very silly and thinks she has sense and has an old fond husband care i confess a very fair foundation for a lover to build upon mel for my lord froth he and his wife will be sufficiently taken up with admiring one another and brisks gallantry as they call it ill observe my uncle myself and jack maskwell has promised me to watch my aunt narrowly and give me notice upon any suspicion as for sir paul my wise fatherinlaw that is to be my dear cynthia has such a share in his fatherly fondness he would scarce make her a moment uneasy to have her happy hereafter care so you have manned your works but i wish you may not have the weakest guard where the enemy is strongest mel maskwell you mean prithee why should you suspect him care faith i cannot help it you know i never liked him i am a little superstitious in physiognomy mel he has obligations of gratitude to bind him to me his dependence upon my uncle is through my means care upon your aunt you mean mel my aunt care im mistaken if there be not a familiarity between them you do not suspect notwithstanding her passion for you mel pooh pooh nothing in the world but his design to do me service and he endeavours to be well in her esteem that he may be able to effect it care well i shall be glad to be mistaken but your aunts aversion in her revenge cannot be any way so effectually shown as in bringing forth a child to disinherit you she is handsome and cunning and naturally wanton maskwell is flesh and blood at best and opportunities between them are frequent his affection to you you have confessed is grounded upon his interest that you have transplanted and should it take root in my lady i dont see what you can expect from the fruit mel i confess the consequence is visible were your suspicions just but see the company is broke up lets meet em scene iv to them lord touchwood lord froth sir paul plyant and

sign i hit you in the teeth if you show em lord froth he he he i swear thats so very pretty i cant forbear care i find a quibble bears more sway in your lordships face than a jest lord touch sir paul

ill shew you what i have lord froth ill walk a turn in the garden and come to you scene iii mellefont cynthia mel youre thoughtful cynthia cynt im thinking though marriage makes man and wife one flesh it leaves em still two fools and they become more conspicuous by setting off one another mel thats only when two fools meet and their follies are opposed cynt nay i have known two wits meet and by the opposition of their wit render themselves as ridiculous as fools tis an odd game were going to play at what think you of drawing stakes and giving over in time mel no hangt thats not endeavouring to win because its possible we may lose since we have shuffled and cut lets even turn up trump now cynt then i find its like cards if either of us have a good hand it is an accident of fortune mel no marriage is rather like a game at bowls fortune indeed makes the match and the two nearest and sometimes the two farthest are together but the game depends entirely upon judgment cynt still it is a game and consequently one of us must be a loser mel not at all only a friendly trial of skill and the winnings to be laid out in an entertainment whats here the music oh my lord has promised the company a new song well get em to give it us by the way musicians crossing the stage pray let us have the favour of you to practise the song before the company hear it song i cynthia frowns wheneer i woo her yet shes vext if i give over much she fears i should undo her but much more to lose her lover thus in doubting she refuses and not winning thus she loses ii prithee cynthia look behind you age and wrinkles will oertake you then too late desire will find you when the power must forsake you think o think o th sad condition to be past yet wish fruition mel you shall have my thanks below to the musicians they go out scene iv to them sir paul plyant and lady plyant sir paul gadsbud i am provoked into a fermentation as my lady froth says was ever the like read of in story lady plyant sir paul

myself pray sir paul hold you contented cynt bless me what makes my father in such a passion i never saw him thus before sir paul hold yourself contented my lady plyant i find passion coming upon me by inflation and i cannot submit as formerly therefore give way lady plyant how now will you be pleased to retire and sir paul no marry will i not be pleased i am pleased to be angry thats my pleasure at this time mel what can this mean lady plyant gads my life the mans distracted why how now who are you what am i slidikins cant i govern you what did i marry you for am i not to be absolute and uncontrollable is it fit a woman of my spirit and conduct should be contradicted in a matter of this concern sir paul it concerns me and only me besides im not to be governed at all times when i am in tranquillity my lady plyant shall command sir paul but when i am provoked to fury i cannot incorporate with patience and reason as soon may tigers match with tigers lambs with lambs and every creature couple with its foe as the poet says lady plyant hes hotheaded still tis in vain to talk to you but remember i have a curtainlecture for you you disobedient headstrong brute sir paul no tis because i wont be headstrong because i wont be a brute and have my head fortified that i am thus exasperated but i will protect my honour and yonder is the violator of my fame lady plyant tis my honour that is concerned and the violation was intended to me your honour you have none but what is in my keeping and i can dispose of it when i please therefore dont provoke me sir paul hum gadsbud she says true well my lady march on i will fight under you then i am convinced as far as passion will permit lady plyant and sir paul come up to mellefont lady plyant inhuman and treacherous sir paul thou serpent and first tempter of womankind cynt bless me sir madam what mean you sir paul thy thy come away thy touch him not come hither girl go not near him theres nothing but deceit about him snakes are in his peruke and the crocodile of nilus is in his belly he will eat thee up alive lady plyant dishonourable impudent creature mel for heavns sake madam to whom do you direct this language lady plyant have i behaved myself with all the decorum and nicety befitting the person of sir pauls wife have i preserved my honour as it were in a snowhouse for these three years past have i been white and unsullied even by sir paul himself sir paul nay she has been an invincible wife even to me thats the truth ont lady plyant have i i say preserved myself like a fair sheet of paper for you to make a blot upon sir paul and she shall make a simile with any woman in england mel i am so amazed i know not what to say sir paul do you think my daughter this pretty creature gadsbud shes a wife for a cherubim do you think her fit for nothing but to be a stalking horse to stand before you while you take aim at my wife gadsbud i was never angry before in my life and ill never be appeased again mel hell and damnation this is my aunt such malice can be engendered nowhere else aside lady plyant sir paul take cynthia from his sight leave me to strike him with the remorse of his intended crime cynt pray sir stay hear him i dare affirm hes innocent sir paul innocent why harkee come hither thy harkee i had it from his aunt my sister touchwood gadsbud he does not care a farthing for anything of thee but thy portion why hes in love with my wife he would have tantalised thee and made a cuckold of thy poor father and that would certainly have broke my heart im sure if ever i should have horns they would kill me they would never come kindly i should die of em like a child that was cutting his teeth i should indeed thy therefore come away but providence has prevented all therefore come away when i bid you cynt i must obey scene v lady plyant mellefont lady plyant oh such a thing the impiety of it startles me to wrong so good so fair a creature and one that loves you tenderly tis a barbarity of barbarities and nothing could be guilty of it mel but the greatest villain imagination can form i grant it and next to the villainy of such a fact is the villainy of aspersing me with the guilt how which way was i to wrong her for yet i understand you not lady plyant why gads my life cousin mellefont you cannot be so peremptory as to deny it when i tax you with it to your face for now sir pauls gone you are corum nobus mel by heavn i love her more than life or lady plyant fiddle faddle dont tell me of this and that and everything in the world but give me mathemacular demonstration answer me directly but i have not patience oh the impiety of it as i was saying and the unparalleled wickedness o merciful father how could you think to reverse nature so to make the daughter the means of procuring the mother mel the daughter to procure the mother lady plyant ay for though i am not cynthias own mother i am her fathers wife and thats near enough to make it incest mel incest o my precious aunt and the devil in conjunction aside lady plyant oh reflect upon the horror of that and then the guilt of deceiving everybody marrying the daughter only to make a cuckold of the father and then seducing me debauching my purity and perverting me from the road of virtue in which i have trod thus long and never made one trip not one faux pas oh consider it what would you have to answer for if you should provoke me to frailty alas humanity is feeble heavn knows very feeble and unable to support itself mel where am i is it day and am i awake madam lady plyant and nobody knows how circumstances may happen together to my thinking now i could resist the strongest temptation but yet i know tis impossible for me to know whether i could or not theres no certainty in the things of this life mel madam pray give me leave to ask you one question lady plyant o lord ask me the question ill swear ill refuse it i swear ill deny it therefore dont ask me nay you shant ask me i swear ill deny it o gemini you have brought all the blood into my face i warrant i am as red as a turkeycock o fie cousin mellefont mel nay madam hear me i mean lady plyant hear you no no ill deny you first and hear you afterwards for one does not know how ones mind may change upon hearing hearing is one of the senses and all the senses are fallible i wont trust my honour i assure you my honour is infallible and uncomeatable mel for heavns sake madam lady plyant oh name it no more bless me how can you talk of heavn and have so much wickedness in your heart may be you dont think it a sin they say some of you gentlemen dont think it a sin may be it is no sin to them that dont think it so indeed if i did not think it a sin but still my honour if it were no sin but then to marry my daughter for the conveniency of frequent opportunities ill never consent to that as sure as can be ill break the match mel death and amazement madam upon my knees lady plyant nay nay rise up come you shall see my goodnature i know love is powerful and nobody can help his passion tis not your fault nor i swear it is not mine how can i help it if i have charms and how can you help it if you are made a captive i swear it is pity it should be a fault but my honour well but your honour too but the sin well but the necessity o lord heres somebody coming i dare not stay well you must consider of your crime and strive as much as can be against it strive be sure but dont be melancholic dont despair but never think that ill grant you anything o lord no but be sure you lay aside all thoughts of the marriage for though i know you dont love cynthia only as a blind for your passion to me yet it will make me jealous o lord what did i say jealous no no i cant be jealous for i must not love you therefore dont hope but dont despair neither oh theyre coming i must fly scene vi mellefont alone mel after a pause so then spite of my care and foresight i am caught caught in my security yet this was but a shallow artifice unworthy of my machiavellian aunt there must be more behind this is but the first flash the priming of her engine destruction follows hard if not most presently prevented scene vii to him maskwell mel maskwell welcome thy presence is a view of land appearing to my shipwrecked hopes the witch has raised the storm and her ministers have done their work you see the vessels are parted mask i know it i met sir paul towing away cynthia come trouble not your head ill join you together ere tomorrow morning or drown between you in the attempt mel theres comfort in a hand stretched out to one thats sinking though neer so far off mask no sinking nor no danger come cheer up why you dont know that while i plead for you your aunt has given me a retaining fee nay i am your greatest enemy and she does but journeywork under me mel ha hows this mask what dye think of my being employed in the execution of all her plots ha ha ha by heavn its true i have undertaken to break the match i have undertaken to make your uncle disinherit you to get you turned out of doors and to ha ha ha i cant tell you for laughing oh she has opened her heart to me i am to turn you agrazing and to ha ha ha marry cynthia myself theres a plot for you mel ha oh see i see my rising sun light breaks through clouds upon me and i shall live in day oh my maskwell how shall i thank or praise thee thou hast outwitted woman but tell me how couldst thou thus get into her confidence ha how but was it her contrivance to persuade my lady plyant to this extravagant belief mask it was and to tell you the truth i encouraged it for your diversion though it made you a little uneasy for the present yet the reflection of it must needs be entertaining i warrant she was very violent at first mel ha ha ha ay a very fury but i was most afraid of her violence at last if you had not come as you did i dont know what she might have attempted mask ha ha ha i know her temper well you must know then that all my contrivances were but bubbles till at last i pretended to have been long secretly in love with cynthia that did my business that convinced your aunt i might be trusted since it was as much my interest as hers to break the match then she thought my jealousy might qualify me to assist her in her revenge and in short in that belief told me the secrets of her heart at length we made this agreement if i accomplish her designs as i told you before she has engaged to put cynthia with all her fortune into my power mel she is most gracious in her favour well and dear jack how hast thou contrived mask i would not have you stay to hear it now for i dont know but she may come this way i am to meet her anon after that ill tell you the whole matter be here in this gallery an hour hence by that time i imagine our consultation may be over mel i will till then success attend thee scene viii maskwell alone till then success will attend me for when i meet you i meet the only obstacle to my fortune cynthia let thy beauty gild my crimes and whatsoever i commit of treachery or deceit shall be imputed to me as a merit treachery what treachery love cancels all the bonds of friendship and sets men right upon their first foundations duty to kings piety to parents gratitude to benefactors and fidelity to friends are different and particular ties but the name of rival cuts em all asunder and is a general acquittance rival is equal and love like death an universal leveller of mankind ha but is there not such a thing as honesty yes and whosoever has it about him bears an enemy in his breast for your honest man as i take it is that nice scrupulous conscientious person who will cheat nobody but himself such another coxcomb as your wise man who is too hard for all the world and will be made a fool of by nobody but himself ha ha ha well for wisdom and honesty give me cunning and hypocrisy oh tis such a pleasure to angle for fairfaced fools then that hungry gudgeon credulity will bite at anything why let me see i have the same face the same words and accents when i speak what i do think and when i speak what i do not think the very same and dear dissimulation is the only art not to be known from nature why will mankind be fools and be deceived and why are friends and lovers oaths believed when each who searches strictly his own mind may so much fraud and power of baseness find act iii scene i lord touchwood and lady touchwood lady touch my lord can you blame my brother plyant if he refuse his daughter upon this provocation the contracts void by this unheardof impiety lord touch i dont believe it true he has better principles pho tis nonsense come come i know my lady plyant has a large eye and would centre everything in her own circle tis not the first time she has mistaken respect for love and made sir paul jealous of the civility of an undesigning person the better to bespeak his security in her unfeigned pleasures lady touch you censure hardly my lord my sisters honour is very well known lord touch yes i believe i know some that have been familiarly acquainted with it this is a little trick wrought by some pitiful contriver envious of my nephews merit lady touch nay my lord it may be so and i hope it will be found so but that will require some time for in such a case as this demonstration is necessary lord touch there should have been demonstration of the contrary too before it had been believed lady touch so i suppose there was lord touch how where when lady touch that i cant tell nay i dont say there was i am willing to believe as favourably of my nephew as i can lord touch i dont know that half aside lady touch how dont you believe that say you my lord lord touch no i dont say so i confess i am troubled to find you so cold in his defence lady touch his defence bless me would you have me defend an ill thing lord touch you believe it then lady touch i dont know i am very unwilling to speak my thoughts in anything that may be to my cousins disadvantage besides i find my lord you are prepared to receive an ill impression from any opinion of mine which is not consenting with your own but since i am like to be suspected in the end and tis a pain any longer to dissemble i own it to you in short i do believe it nay and can believe anything worse if it were laid to his charge dont ask me my reasons my lord for they are not fit to be told you lord touch im amazed there must be something more than ordinary in this aside not fit to be told me madam you can have no interests wherein i am not concerned and consequently the same reasons ought to be convincing to me which create your satisfaction or disquiet lady touch but those which cause my disquiet i am willing to have remote from your hearing good my lord dont press me lord touch dont oblige me to press you lady touch whatever it was tis past and that is better to be unknown which cannot be prevented therefore let me beg you to rest satisfied lord touch when you have told me i will lady touch you wont lord touch by my life my dear i will lady touch what if you cant lord touch how then i must know nay i will no more trifling i charge you tell me by all our mutual peace to come upon your duty lady touch nay my lord you need say no more to make me lay my heart before you but dont be thus transported compose yourself it is not of concern to make you lose one minutes temper tis not indeed my dear nay by this kiss you shant be angry o lord i wish i had not told you anything indeed my lord you have frighted me nay look pleased ill tell you lord touch

sorry and were it to do again would not lord touch sorry for what death you rack me with delay lady touch nay no great matter only well i have your promise pho why nothing only your nephew had a mind to amuse himself sometimes with a little gallantry towards me nay i cant think he meant anything seriously but methought it looked oddly lord touch confusion and hell what do i hear lady touch or may be he thought he was not enough akin to me upon your account and had a mind to create a nearer relation on his own a lover you know my lord ha ha ha well but thats all now you have it well remember your promise my lord and dont take any notice of it to him lord touch no no no damnation lady touch nay i swear you must not a little harmless mirth only misplaced thats all but if it were more tis over now and alls well for my part i have forgot it and so has he i hope for i have not heard anything from him these two days lord touch these two days is it so fresh unnatural villain death ill have him stripped and turned naked out of my doors this moment and let him rot and perish incestuous brute lady touch oh for heavns sake my lord youll ruin me if you take such public notice of it it will be a town talk consider your own and my honour nay i told you you would not be satisfied when you knew it lord touch before ive done i will be satisfied ungrateful monster how long lady touch lord i dont know i wish my lips had grown together when i told you almost a twelvemonth nay i wont tell you any more till you are yourself pray my lord dont let the company see you in this disorder yet i confess i cant blame you for i think i was never so surprised in my life who would have thought my nephew could have so misconstrued my kindness but will you go into your closet and recover your temper ill make an excuse of sudden business to the company and come to you pray good dear my lord let me beg you do now ill come immediately and tell you all will you my lord lord touch i will i am mute with wonder lady touch well but go now heres somebody coming lord touch well i go you wont stay for i would hear more of this lady touch i follow instantly so scene ii lady touchwood maskwell mask this was a masterpiece and did not need my help though i stood ready for a cue to come in and confirm all had there been occasion lady touch have you seen mellefont mask i have and am to meet him here about this time lady touch how does he bear his disappointment mask secure in my assistance he seemed not much afflicted but rather laughed at the shallow artifice which so little time must of necessity discover yet he is apprehensive of some farther design of yours and has engaged me to watch you i believe he will hardly be able to prevent your plot yet i would have you use caution and expedition lady touch expedition indeed for all we do must be performed in the remaining part of this evening and before the company break up lest my lord should cool and have an opportunity to talk with him privately my lord must not see him again mask by no means therefore you must aggravate my lords displeasure to a degree that will admit of no conference with him what think you of mentioning me lady touch how mask to my lord as having been privy to mellefonts design upon you but still using my utmost endeavours to dissuade him though my friendship and love to him has made me conceal it yet you may say i threatened the next time he attempted anything of that kind to discover it to my lord lady touch to what end is this mask it will confirm my lords opinion of my honour and honesty and create in him a new confidence in me which should this design miscarry will be necessary to the forming another plot that i have in my head to cheat you as well as the rest aside lady touch ill do it ill tell him you hindered him once from forcing me mask excellent your ladyship has a most improving fancy you had best go to my lord keep him as long as you can in his closet and i doubt not but you will mould him to what you please your guests are so engaged in their own follies and intrigues theyll miss neither of you lady touch when shall we meet at eight this evening in my chamber there rejoice at our success and toy away an hour in mirth mask i will not fail scene iii maskwell alone i know what she means by toying away an hour well enough pox i have lost all appetite to her yet shes a fine woman and i loved her once but i dont know since i have been in a great measure kept by her the case is altered what was my pleasure is become my duty and i have as little stomach to her now as if i were her husband should she smoke my design upon cynthia i were in a fine pickle she has a damned penetrating head and knows how to interpret a coldness the right way therefore i must dissemble ardour and ecstasy thats resolved how easily and pleasantly is that dissembled before fruition pox ont that a man cant drink without quenching his thirst ha yonder comes mellefont thoughtful let me think meet her at eight hum ha by heavn i have it if i can speak to my lord before was it my brain or providence no matter which i will deceive em all and yet secure myself twas a lucky thought well this doubledealing is a jewel here he comes now for me maskwell pretending not to see him walks by him and speaks as it were to himself scene iv to him mellefont musing mask mercy on us what will the wickedness of this world come to mel how now jack what so full of contemplation that you run over mask im glad youre come for i could not contain myself any longer and was just going to give vent to a secret which nobody but you ought to drink down your aunts just gone from hence mel and having trusted thee with the secrets of her soul thou art villainously bent to discover em all to me ha mask im afraid my frailty leans that way but i dont know whether i can in honour discover em all mel all all man what you may in honour betray her as far as she betrays herself no tragical design upon my person i hope mask no but its a comical design upon mine mel what dost thou mean mask listen and be dumb we have been bargaining about the rate of your ruin mel like any two guardians to an orphan heiress well mask and whereas pleasure is generally paid with mischief what mischief i do is to be paid with pleasure mel so when youve swallowed the potion you sweeten your mouth with a plum mask you are merry sir but i shall probe your constitution in short the price of your banishment is to be paid with the person of mel of cynthia and her fortune why you forget you told me this before mask no no so far you are right and i am as an earnest of that bargain to have full and free possession of the person of your aunt mel ha pho you trifle mask by this light im serious all raillery apart i knew twould stun you this evening at eight she will receive me in her bedchamber mel hell and the devil is she abandoned of all grace why the woman is possessed mask well will you go in my stead mel by heavn into a hot furnace sooner mask no you would not it would not be so convenient as i can order matters mel what dye mean mask mean not to disappoint the lady i assure you ha ha ha how gravely he looks come come i wont perplex you tis the only thing that providence could have contrived to make me capable of serving you either to my inclination or your own necessity mel how how for heavns sake dear maskwell mask why thus ill go according to appointment you shall have notice at the critical minute to come and surprise your aunt and me together counterfeit a rage against me and ill make my escape through the private passage from her chamber which ill take care to leave open twill be hard if then you cant bring her to any conditions for this discovery will disarm her of all defence and leave her entirely at your mercy nay she must ever after be in awe of you mel let me adore thee my better genius by heavn i think it is not in the power of fate to disappoint my hopes my hopes my certainty mask well ill meet you here within a quarter of eight and give you notice mel good fortune ever go along with thee scene v mellefont careless care mellefont get out o th way my lady plyants coming and i shall never succeed while thou art in sight though she begins to tack about but i made love a great while to no purpose mel why whats the matter shes convinced that i dont care for her care i cant get an answer from her that does not begin with her honour or her virtue her religion or some such cant then she has told me the whole history of sir pauls nine years courtship how he has lain for whole nights together upon the stairs before her chamberdoor and that the first favour he received from her was a piece of an old scarlet petticoat for a stomacher which since the day of his marriage he has out of a piece of gallantry converted into a nightcap and wears it still with much solemnity on his anniversary weddingnight mel that i have seen with the ceremony thereunto belonging for on that night he creeps in at the beds feet like a gulled bassa that has married a relation of the grand signior and that night he has his arms at liberty did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps him he has confessed to me that but at some certain times that is i suppose when she apprehends being with child he never has the privilege of using the familiarity of a husband with a wife he was once given to scrambling with his hands and sprawling in his sleep and ever since she has him swaddled up in blankets and his hands and feet swathed down and so put to bed and there he lies with a great beard like a russian bear upon a drift of snow you are very great with him i wonder he never told you his grievances he will i warrant you care excessively foolish but that which gives me most hopes of her is her telling me of the many temptations she has resisted mel nay then you have her for a womans bragging to a man that she has overcome temptations is an argument that they were weakly offered and a challenge to him to engage her more irresistibly tis only an enhancing the price of the commodity by telling you how many customers have underbid her care nay i dont despair but still she has a grudging to you i talked to her tother night at my lord froths masquerade when im satisfied she knew me and i had no reason to complain of my reception but i find women are not the same barefaced and in masks and a vizor disguises their inclinations as much as their faces mel tis a mistake for women may most properly be said to be unmasked when they wear vizors for that secures them from blushing and being out of countenance and next to being in the dark or alone they are most truly themselves in a vizor mask here they come ill leave you ply her close and by and by clap a billet doux into her hand for a woman never thinks a man truly in love with her till he has been fool enough to think of her out of her sight and to lose so much time as to write to her scene vi careless sir paul and lady plyant sir paul shant we disturb your meditation mr careless you would be private care you bring that along with you sir paul that shall be always welcome to my privacy sir paul o sweet sir you load your humble servants both me and my wife with continual favours lady plyant sir paul what a phrase was there you will be making answers and taking that upon you which ought to lie upon me that you should have so little breeding to think mr careless did not apply himself to me pray what have you to entertain anybodys privacy i swear and declare in the face of the world im ready to blush for your ignorance sir paul i acquiesce my lady but dont snub so loud aside to her lady plyant mr careless if a person that is wholly illiterate might be supposed to be capable of being qualified to make a suitable return to those obligations which you are pleased to confer upon one that is wholly incapable of being qualified in all those circumstances im sure i should rather attempt it than anything in the world courtesies for im sure theres nothing in the world that i would rather courtesies but i know mr careless is so great a critic and so fine a gentleman that it is impossible for me care o heavens madam you confound me sir paul gadsbud shes a fine person lady plyant o lord sir pardon me we women have not those advantages i know my imperfections but at the same time you must give me leave to declare in the face of the world that nobody is more sensible of favours and things for with the reserve of my honour i assure you mr careless i dont know anything in the world i would refuse to a person so meritorious youll pardon my want of expression care o your ladyship is abounding in all excellence particularly that of phrase lady plyant you are so obliging

paul nay i swear and vow that was pretty care o sir paul you are the happiest man alive such a lady that is the envy of her own sex and the admiration of ours sir paul your humble servant i am i thank heaven in a fine way of living as i may say peacefully and happily and i think need not envy any of my neighbours blessed be providence ay truly mr careless my lady is a great blessing a fine discreet wellspoken woman as you shall see if it becomes me to say so and we live very comfortably together she is a little hasty sometimes and so am i but mines soon over and then im so sorry o mr careless if

should have carried it to my lady first boy tis directed to your worship sir paul well well my lady reads all letters first child do so no more dye hear tim boy no and please you scene viii careless sir paul lady plyant sir paul a humour of my wifes you know women have little fancies but as i was telling you mr careless if it were not for one thing i should think myself the happiest man in the world indeed that touches me near very near care what can that be sir paul sir paul why i have i thank heaven a very plentiful fortune a good estate in the country some houses in town and some money a pretty tolerable personal estate and it is a great grief to me indeed it is mr careless that i have not a son to inherit this tis true i have a daughter and a fine dutiful child she is though i say it blessed be providence i may say for indeed mr careless i am mightily beholden to providence a poor unworthy sinner but if i had a son ah thats my affliction and my only affliction indeed i cannot refrain tears when it comes in my mind cries care why methinks that might be easily remedied my ladys a fine likely woman sir paul oh a fine likely woman as you shall see in a summers day indeed she

generation indeed its true mr careless it breaks my heart i am her husband as i may say though far unworthy of that honour yet i am her husband but alasaday i have no more familiarity with her person as to that matter than with my own mother no indeed care alasaday this is a lamentable story my lady must be told ont she must ifaith sir paul tis an injury to the world sir paul ah would to heaven

woman but i think she laughs a little too much lord froth merry o lord what a character that is of a woman of quality you have been at my lady whiflers upon her day madam cynt yes my lord i must humour this fool aside lord froth well and how hee what is your sense of the conversation cynt oh most ridiculous a perpetual comfort of laughing without any harmony for sure my lord to laugh out of time is as disagreeable as to sing out of time or out of tune lord froth hee hee hee right and then my lady whifler is so ready she always comes in three bars too soon and then what do they laugh at

his drunken fiery face just as the sun does more or less brisk thats right alls well alls well more or less lady froth reads and when at night his labours done then too like heavns charioteer the sun ay charioteer does better into the dairy he descends and there his whipping and his driving ends there hes secure from danger of a bilk his fare is paid him and he sets in milk for susan you know is thetis and so brisk incomparable well and proper egad but i have one exception to make dont you think bilk i know its good rhyme but dont you think bilk and fare too like a hackney coachman lady froth

to speak and sits in expectation of his no jest with her gums bare and her mouth open brisk like an oyster at low ebb egad ha ha ha cynt aside well i find there are no fools so inconsiderable in themselves but they can render other people contemptible by exposing their infirmities lady froth then that tother great strapping lady i cant hit of her name the old fat fool that paints so exorbitantly brisk i know whom you mean but deuce take me i cant hit of her name neither paints dye say why she lays it on with a trowel then she has a great beard that bristles through it and makes her look as if she were plastered with lime and hair let me perish lady froth oh you made a song upon her mr brisk brisk he egad so i did my lord can sing it cynt o good my lord lets hear it brisk tis not a song neither its a sort of an epigram or rather an epigrammatic sonnet i dont know what to call it but its satire sing it my lord lord froth sings ancient phyllis has young graces tis a strange thing but a true one shall i tell you how she herself makes her own faces and each morning wears a new one wheres the wonder now brisk short but theres salt int my way of writing egad scene xi to them footman lady froth how now foot your ladyships chair is come lady froth is nurse and the child in it foot yes madam lady froth o the dear creature lets go see it lord froth i swear my dear youll spoil that child with sending it to and again so often this is the seventh time the chair has gone for her today lady froth o law i swear its but the sixth and i havent seen her these two hours the poor

lady froth threequarters but i swear she has a world of wit and can sing a tune already my lord wont you go wont you what not to see saph pray my lord come see little saph i knew you could not stay scene xii cynthia alone cynt tis not so hard to counterfeit joy in the depth of affliction as to dissemble mirth in company of fools why should i call em fools the world thinks better of em for these have quality and education wit and fine conversation are received and admired by the world if not they like and admire themselves and why is not that true wisdom for tis happiness and for ought i know we have misapplied the name all this while and mistaken the thing since if happiness in selfcontent is placed the wise are wretched and fools only blessd act iv scene i mellefont and cynthia cynt i heard him loud as i came by the closetdoor and my lady with him but she seemed to moderate his passion mel ay hell thank her as gentle breezes moderate a fire but i shall counterwork her spells and ride the witch in her own bridle cynt its impossible shell cast beyond you still ill lay my life it will never be a match mel what cynt between you and me mel why so cynt my mind gives me it wont because we are both willing we each of us strive to reach the goal and hinder one another in the race i swear it never does well when the parties are so agreed for when people walk hand in hand theres neither overtaking nor meeting we hunt in couples where we both pursue the same game but forget one another and tis because we are so near that we dont think of coming together mel hum gad i believe theres something in it marriage is the game that we hunt and while we think that we only have it in view i dont see but we have it in our power cynt within reach for example give me your hand you have looked through the wrong end of the perspective all this while for nothing has been between us but our fears mel i dont know why we should not steal out of the house this very moment and marry one another without consideration or the fear of repentance pox o fortune portion settlements and jointures cynt ay ay what have we to do with em you know we marry for love mel love love downright very villainous love cynt and he that cant live upon love deserves to die in a ditch here then i give you my promise in spite of duty any temptation of wealth your inconstancy or my own inclination to change mel to run most wilfully and unreasonably away with me this moment and be married cynt hold never to marry anybody else mel thats but a kind of negative consent why you wont baulk the frolic cynt if you had not been so assured of your own conduct i would not but tis but reasonable that since i consent to like a man without the vile consideration of money he should give me a very evident demonstration of his wit therefore let me see you undermine my lady touchwood as you boasted and force her to give her consent and then mel ill dot cynt and ill dot mel this very next ensuing hour of eight oclock is the last minute of her reign unless the devil assist her in propria persona cynt well if the devil should assist her and your plot miscarry mel ay what am i to trust to then cynt why if you give me very clear demonstration that it was the devil ill allow for irresistible odds but if i find it to be only chance or destiny or unlucky stars or anything but the very devil im inexorable only still ill keep my word and live a maid for your sake mel and you wont die one for your own so still theres hope cynt heres my motherinlaw and your friend careless i would not have em see us together yet scene ii careless and lady plyant lady plyant i swear mr careless you are very alluring and say so many fine things and nothing is so moving to me as a fine thing well i must do

im sure than my illiterate praises can description care in a whining tone ah heavens madam you ruin me with kindness your charming tongue pursues the victory of your eyes while at your feet your poor adorer dies lady plyant ah very fine care still whining ah why are you so fair so bewitching fair o let me grow to the ground here and feast upon that hand o let me press it to my heart my trembling heart the nimble movement shall instruct your pulse and teach it to alarm desire zoons im almost at the end of my cant if she does not yield quickly aside lady plyant o thats so passionate and fine i cannot hear i am not safe if i stay and must leave you care and must you leave me rather let me languish out a wretched life and breath my soul beneath your feet i must say the same thing over again

o impiety but did you swear did that sweet creature swear ha how durst you swear without my consent ah gadsbud who am i cynt pray dont be angry sir when i swore i had your consent and therefore i swore sir paul why then the revoking my consent does annul or make of none effect your oath so you may unswear it again the law will allow it cynt ay but my conscience never will sir paul gadsbud no matter for that conscience and law never go together you must not expect that lady plyant ay but sir paul i conceive if she has sworn dye mark me if she has once sworn it is most unchristian inhuman and obscene that she should break it ill make up the match again because mr careless said it would oblige him aside sir paul does your ladyship conceive so why i was of that opinion once too nay if your ladyship conceives so im of that opinion again but i can neither find my lord nor my lady to know what they intend lady plyant im satisfied that my cousin mellefont has been much wronged cynt aside im amazed to find her of our side for im sure she loved him lady plyant i know my lady touchwood has no kindness for him and besides i have been informed by mr careless that mellefont had never anything more than a profound respect that he has owned himself to be my admirer tis true but he was never so presumptuous to entertain any dishonourable notions of things so that if this be made plain i dont see how my daughter can in conscience or honour or anything in the world sir paul indeed if this be made plain as my lady your mother says child lady plyant plain i was informed of it by mr careless and i assure you mr careless is a person that has a most extraordinary respect and honour for you sir paul cynt aside and for your ladyship too i believe or else you had not changed sides so soon now i begin to find it sir paul i am much obliged to mr careless really he is a person that i have a great value for not only for that but because he has a great veneration for your ladyship

air gadsbud she was never thus before well i must own myself the most beholden to mr careless as sure as can be this is all his doing something that he has said well tis a rare thing to have an ingenious friend well your ladyship is of opinion that the match may go forward lady plyant by all means mr careless has satisfied me of the matter sir paul well why then lamb you may keep your oath but have a care about making rash vows come hither to me and kiss papa lady plyant i swear and declare i am in such a twitter to read mr careless his letter that i cant forbear any longer but though i
