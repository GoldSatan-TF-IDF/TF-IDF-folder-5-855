the girl was so sure she would get the job that she had come to westchester with her suitcase she sat in the living room of the christiansens house looking in her plain blue coat and hat even younger than her twentyone years have you worked as a governess before mr christiansen asked he sat beside his wife on the sofa any references i mean i was a maid at mr dwight howells home in new york for the last seven months lucille looked at him with suddenly wide gray eyes i could get a reference from there if you like but when i saw your advertisement this morning i didnt want to wait ive always wanted a place where there are children mrs christiansen smiled at the girls enthusiasm and said we might phone them of course what do you say ronald you wanted someone who really liked children and fifteen minutes later lucille smith was standing in her room in the servants house at the back of the big house putting on her new white uniform youre starting again lucille she told herself in the mirror youre going to forget everything that happened before but her eyes grew too wide again as though to deny her words they looked like her mothers when they opened like that and her mother was part of what she must forget there were only a few things to remember a few silly habits like burning bits of paper in ashtrays forgetting time sometimes little things that many people did but that she must remember not to do with practice she would remember because she was just like other people hadnt the psychiatrist told her so she looked out at the garden and lawn that lay between the servants house and the big house the garden was longer than it was wide and there was a fountain in the center it was a beautiful garden and trees so high and close together that lucille could not see through them and did not have to admit or believe that there was another house somewhere beyond the howell house in new york tall and heavily ornamented looking like an old wedding cake in a row of other old wedding cakes the christiansen house was friendly and alive there were children in it thank god for the children but she had not even met them yet she hurried downstairs and went across to the big house what had the christiansens agreed to pay her she could not remember and did not care she would have worked for nothing just to live in such a place mrs christiansen took her upstairs to the nursery where the children lay on the floor among colored pencils and picture books nicky heloise this is your new nurse their mother said her name is lucille the little boy stood up and said how do you do and heloise mrs christiansen said leading the second child who was smaller to lucille heloise stared and said how do you do nicky is nine and heloise six lucille could not take her eyes from them they were the perfect children of her perfect house they looked up at her with eyes that were curious trusting loving mrs christiansen smoothed the little girls hair with a loving gentleness that fascinated lucille its just about time for their lunch she said youll have your meals up here lucille lisabeth will be up with the lunch in a few minutes she paused at the door you arent nervous about anything are you lucille oh no madam well you mustnt be she seemed about to say something else but only smiled and went out lucille stared after her wondering what that something else might have been youre a lot prettier than catherine nicky told her catherine was our nurse before she went back to scotland we didnt like catherine no said heloise we didnt like catherine nicky stared at his sister you shouldnt say that thats what i said lucille laughed then nicky and heloise laughed too a maid entered with lunch and put it on the table in the center of the room im lisabeth jenkins miss she said shyly my names lucille smith the girl said if you need anything just shout said the maid there were three omelets and some tomato soup lucilles coffee was in a silver pot and the children had two large glasses of milk it was wonderful to be with these children she had always been clumsy at the howell house but here it would not matter if she dropped a plate or a spoon the children would only laugh lucille drank some of her coffee but the cup slipped and she spilled some of the coffee on the cloth piggy laughed heloise heloise said nicky and went to fetch some paper towels from the bathroom they cleaned up together dad always gives us a little of his coffee said nicky as he sat down again lucille had been wondering if the children would mention her spilling the coffee to their mother she sensed that nicky was offering her a bribe does he she asked he pours a little in our milk nicky went on like this lucille poured a bit into each glass the children gasped with pleasure yes catherine wouldnt give us any coffee would she heloise said nicky not her heloise took a long delicious drink a happy feeling rose inside lucille the children liked her there was no doubt of that she remembered going to public parks in the city during the three years she had worked as a maid in different houses just to sit and watch the children play but they had usually been dirty and had used bad language once she had seen a mother hit her own child across the face lucille remembered how she had run away in pain and horror why do you have such big eyes heloise demanded lucille jumped my mother had big eyes too she said deliberately as if confessing her mother had been dead three weeks now but it seemed much longer that was because she was forgetting all the hope of the last three years as she had waited for her mother to recover but recover to what the illness was something separate something which had killed her mother it had been stupid to hope for her mother to become sane which she had never been even the doctors had told her that and they had told her other things about herself good encouraging things that she was as sane as her father had been you havent finished eating said nicky i wasnt very hungry said lucille we could go out to the sandbox now he suggested i want you to see our castle the sandbox was in the back corner of the house lucille sat on the wooden edge of the box and watched while the children built their sandcastle im the young queen and im a prisoner in the castle heloise shouted yes and ill rescue her lucille shouted nicky when the castle was finished nicky put six small colored stones just inside these are the good soldiers he said theyre prisoners in the castle too heloise got more small stones from the garden she was to be the castle army as well as the queen as the game continued lucille found herself wishing for something really dangerous to happen to heloise so that she could prove her great courage and loyalty she would be seriously wounded herself perhaps with a bullet or a knife but she would beat off the attacker then the christiansens would love her and keep her with them always ooow it was heloise nicky had pushed one of her fingers against the edge of the box as they struggled to get the same small stone lucille was alarmed at the sight of the blood and was wildly afraid that lisabeth or mrs christiansen might see it she took heloise to the bathroom next to the nursery and gently washed the finger it was only a small scratch and heloise soon stopped her tears look its only a little scratch lucille said but it was said to calm the children to lucille it was not a little scratch it was a terrible disaster which she had failed to prevent and on her first afternoon heloise smiled dont punish nicky he didnt mean to do it and she ran from the bathroom and jumped on to her bed we have to have our afternoon sleep now she told lucille goodbye goodbye lucille answered and tried to smile she went down to get nicky and when they came back up mrs christiansen was at the nursery door lucilles face went white i dont think its bad madam it its a scratch from the sandbox heloises finger oh dont worry my dear theyre always getting little scratches nicky dear you must learn to be more gentle look how you frightened lucille she laughed and ruffled his hair while the children slept lucille looked at one of their story books the hospital doctor had encouraged her reading she remembered and had told her to go to the cinema too be with normal people and forget all about your mothers difficulties and the psychiatrist had said theres no reason why you should not be as normal as your father was get a job outside the city relax enjoy life forget even the house your family lived in after a year that too was three weeks ago just after her mother had died and what the doctor had said was true in this house where there was peace and love beauty and children she would forget for ever her mothers face with a little gasp of joy she pressed her face into the pages of the story book her eyes half closed slowly she rocked backwards and forwards in the chair conscious of nothing but her own happiness what are you doing nicky asked politely curious lucille brought the book down from her face she smiled like a happy but guilty child reading she laughed nicky laughed too you read veiy close yees said heloise who had also sat up nicky came over and looked at the book we get up at three oclock would you read to us now catherine always read to us until dinner lucille sat down on the floor so they could see the pictures as she read she read for two hours and the time slipped by just after five lisabeth brought their dinner and when the meal was over nicky and heloise demanded more reading until bedtime lucille gladly began another book but lisabeth came to say that it was time for the childrens bath and that mrs christiansen would be up to say good night in a little while when the children were in bed lucille went downstairs with mrs christiansen is everything all right lucille yes madam except can i come up once in the night to see that the children are all right thats a very kind thought lucille but it really isnt necessary lucille was silent im afraid the evenings are going to seem long to you if you ever want to go the cinema in town alfred thats the chauffeur will be glad to take you in the car thank you madam then good night lucille lucille went out the back way and across the garden when she opened her door she wished it was the nursery door that it was morning and time to begin another day how good she thought as she turned out the light to feel pleasantly tired although it was only nine oclock instead of being unable to sleep because of thinking about her mother or worrying about herself she remembered one day not so long ago when for fifteen minutes she had been unable to think of her name she had run in fear to the doctor that was past she might even ask alfred to buy her some cigarettes a luxury she had denied herself for months the second day was like the first except that there was no scratched hand and so was the third and the fourth the only thing that changed was lucilles love for the family a love which grew greater each day saturday evening she found an envelope addressed to herself at the servants house inside was it meant nothing to her to use it she would have to go to the shops where other people were what use had she for money if she was never to leave the christiansen home in a years time she would have and in two years eventually she would have as much as the christiansens and that would not be right would they think it was very strange if she asked to work for nothing or for perhaps she went to see mrs christiansen the next morning its about my pay madam she said its too much for me mrs christiansen looked surprised you are a funny girl lucille you want to be with the children day and night youre always talking about doing something important for us and now your pay is too much she laughed youre certainly different lucille lucille was listening closely how do you mean different madam ive just told you my dear and i refuse to pay you less because that would be treating you badly in fact if you ever want more oh no madam but i wish there was something more i could do for you and the children something bigger nonsense lucille mrs christiansen interrupted mr christiansen and i are both very pleased with you thank you madam lucille went back to the nursery where the children were playing mrs christiansen did not understand if she could just explain about her mother and her fear of herself for so many months how she had never dared take even a cigarette and how just being with the family in this beautiful house had made her well again that night she sat in her room with the light on until after twelve oclock she had her cigarettes now and allowed herself just three in the evening but even these were enough to relax her mind to make her dream of being a heroine and when the three cigarettes were smoked and she would have liked another she put them in her top drawer so that they could not tempt her she noticed the bill the christiansens had given her she took a match and lit it and put the burning end down against the side of her ashtray slowly she lit the rest of the matches one after another and made a tiny well controlled fire when all the matches were burnt she tore the bill into bits and added these to the fire mrs christiansen did not understand but if she saw this she might but this was not enough just loyal service was not enough either anyone would give that for money she was different mrs christiansen had said that lucille remembered what else mrs christiansen had said mr christiansen and i are both very pleased with you lucille smiled at the memory she felt wonderfully strong and happy only one thing was lacking in her happiness she had to prove herself in a crisis she moved nervously around the room if only there were a flood she imagined the water coming higher and higher around the house until it almost rushed into the nursery she would rescue the children and swim with them to safety or if there were an earthquake she would rush in among falling walls and pull the children out perhaps she would go back for some small thing one of nickys toys and be killed then the christiansens would know how much she loved them of if there were a fire fires were common things there might be a terrible fire just from the gasoline that was in the garage she went downstairs through the door that opened into the garage the gasoline tank was three feet high and completely full despite its weight she got it out of the garage and rolled it across the garden making no noise on the grass the windows were dark but even if there had been lights lucille would not have stopped nor if mr christiansen himself had been standing by the fountain because probably she would not have seen him she poured some gasoline on a corner of the house rolled the tank further and poured some more she went on like this until she reached the far corner then she lit a match and walked back the way she had come touching it against the wet places without looking back she went to stand by the door of the servants house to watch at first the flames were pale and eager then they became yellow with bits of red lucille began to relax she would let the flames grow tall even to the nursery window before she rushed in so that the danger would be at its highest a smile came to her mouth and her face was bright in the light of the fire anyone seeing her there would certainly have thought her a beautiful young woman she had lit the fire at five places and now it was creeping up the house like the fingers of a hand warm and gentle lucille smiled but made herself wait suddenly the gasoline tank having grown too warm exploded with a sound like a huge gun and lit up the whole garden for an instant as though this was the sign for which she had been waiting lucille went confidently forward the end
