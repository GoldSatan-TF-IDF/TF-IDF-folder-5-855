the errand boy or how phil brent won success by horatio alger jr author of joes luck frank fowler the cash boy tom temples career tom thatchers fortune ragged dick tattered tom luck and pluck etc etc the errand boy chapter i phil has a little difficulty phil brent was plodding through the snow in the direction of the house where he lived with his stepmother and her son when a snowball moist and hard struck him just below his ear with stinging emphasis the pain was considerable and phils anger rose he turned suddenly his eyes flashing fiercely intent upon discovering who had committed this outrage for he had no doubt that it was intentional he looked in all directions but saw no one except a mild old gentleman in spectacles who appeared to have some difficulty in making his way through the obstructed street phil did not need to be told that it was not the old gentleman who had taken such an unwarrantable liberty with him so he looked farther but his ears gave him the first clew he heard a chuckling laugh which seemed to proceed from behind the stone wall that ran along the roadside i will see who it is he decided and plunging through the snow he surmounted the wall in time to see a boy of about his own age running away across the fields as fast as the deep snow would allow so its you jonas he shouted wrathfully i thought it was some sneaking fellow like you jonas webb his stepbrother his freckled face showing a degree of dismay for he had not calculated on discovery ran the faster but while fear winged his steps anger proved the more effectual spur and phil overtook him after a brief run from the effects of which both boys panted what made you throw that snowball demanded phil angrily as he seized jonas by the collar and shook him you let me alone said jonas struggling ineffectually in his grasp answer me what made you throw that snowball demanded phil in a tone that showed he did not intend to be trifled with because i chose to answered jonas his spite getting the better of his prudence did it hurt you he continued his eyes gleaming with malice i should think it might it was about as hard as a cannonball returned phil grimly is that all youve got to say about it i did it in fun said jonas beginning to see that he had need to be prudent very well i dont like your idea of fun perhaps you wont like mine said phil as he forcibly drew jonas back till he lay upon the snow and then kneeling by his side rubbed his face briskly with snow what are you doin goin to murder me shrieked jonas in anger and dismay i am going to wash your face said phil continuing the operation vigorously i say you quit that ill tell my mother ejaculated jonas struggling furiously if you do tell her why i did it said phil jonas shrieked and struggled but in vain phil gave his face an effectual scrubbing and did not desist until he thought he had avenged the bad treatment he had suffered there get up said he at length jonas scrambled to his feet his mean features working convulsively with anger youll suffer for this he shouted you wont make me said phil contemptuously youre the meanest boy in the village i am willing to leave that to the opinion of all who know me ill tell my mother go home and tell her jonas started for home and phil did not attempt to stop him as he saw jonas reach the street and plod angrily homeward he said to himself i suppose i shall be in hot water for this but i cant help it mrs brent always stands up for her precious son who is as like her as can be well it wont make matters much worse than they have been phil concluded not to go home at once but to allow a little time for the storm to spend its force after jonas had told his story so he delayed half an hour and then walked slowly up to the side door he opened the door brushed off the snow from his boots with the broom that stood behind the door and opening the inner door stepped into the kitchen no one was there as phils first glance satisfied him and he was disposed to hope that mrs brent he never called her mother was out but a thin acid measured voice from the sittingroom adjoining soon satisfied him that there was to be no reprieve philip brent come here phil entered the sittingroom in a rockingchair by the fire sat a thin woman with a sharp visage cold eyes and firmly compressed lips to whom no child would voluntarily draw near on a sofa lay outstretched the hulking form of jonas with whom he had had his little difficulty i am here mrs brent said philip manfully philip brent said mrs brent acidly are you not ashamed to look me in the face i dont know why i should be said philip bracing himself up for the attack you see on the sofa the victim of your brutality continued mrs brent pointing to the recumbent figure of her son jonas jonas as if to emphasize these words uttered a half groan philip could not help smiling for to him it seemed ridiculous you laugh said his stepmother sharply i am not surprised at it you delight in your brutality i suppose you mean that i have treated jonas brutally i see you confess it no mrs brent i do not confess it the brutality you speak of was all on the side of jonas no doubt retorted mrs brent with sarcasm its the case of the wolf and the lamb over again i dont think jonas has represented the matter to you as it happened said phil did he tell you that he flung a snowball at my head as hard as a lump of ice he said he threw a little snow at you playfully and you sprang upon him like a tiger theres a little mistake in that said phil the snowball was hard enough to stun me if it had hit me a little higher i wouldnt be hit like that again for ten dollars that aint so dont believe him mother said jonas from the sofa and what did you do demanded mrs brent with a frown i laid him down on the snow and washed his face with soft snow you might have given him his death of cold said mrs brent with evident hostility i am not sure but the poor boy will have pneumonia now in consequence of your brutal treatment and you have nothing to say as to his attack upon me said phil indignantly i have no doubt you have very much exaggerated it yes he has chimed in jonas from the sofa phil regarded his stepbrother with scorn cant you tell the truth now and then jonas he asked contemptuously you shall not insult my boy in my presence said mrs brent with a little spot of color mantling her high cheekbones philip brent i have too long endured your insolence you think because i am a woman you can be insolent with impunity but you will find yourself mistaken it is time that you understood something that may lead you to lower your tone learn then that you have not a cent of your own you are wholly dependent upon my bounty what did my father leave you all his money asked philip he was not your father answered mrs brent coldly chapter ii a strange revelation philip started in irrepressible astonishment as these words fell from the lips of his stepmother it seemed to him as if the earth were crumbling beneath his feet for he had felt no more certain of the existence of the universe than of his being the son of gerald brent he was not the only person amazed at this declaration jonas forgetting for the moment the part he was playing sat bolt upright on the sofa with his large mouth wide open staring by turns at philip and his mother gosh he exclaimed in a tone indicating utter surprise and bewilderment will you repeat that mrs brent asked philip after a brief pause not certain that he had heard aright i spoke plain english i believe said mrs brent coldly enjoying the effect of her communication i said that mr brent my late husband was not your father i dont believe you burst forth philip impetuously you dont wish to believe me you mean answered his stepmother unmoved no i dont wish to believe you said the boy looking her in the eye you are very polite to doubt a ladys word said mrs brent with sarcasm in such a matter as that i believe no ones word said phil i ask for proof well i am prepared to satisfy you sit down and i will tell you the story philip sat down on the nearest chair and regarded his stepmother fixedly whose son am i he demanded if not mr brents you are getting on too fast jonas continued his mother suddenly turning to her hulking son on whose not very intelligent countenance there was an expression of greedy curiosity do you understand that what i am going to say is to be a secret not to be spoken of to any one yesm answered jonas readily very well now to proceed philip you have heard probably that when you were very small your father i mean mr brent lived in a small town in ohio called fultonville yes i have heard him say so do you remember in what business he was then engaged he kept a hotel yes a small hotel but as large as the place required he was not troubled by many guests the few who stopped at his house were business men from towns near by or drummers from the great cities who had occasion to stay over a night one evening however a gentleman arrived with an unusual companion in other words a boy of about three years of age the boy had a bad cold and seemed to need womanly care mr brents wife my mother the woman you were taught to call mother corrected the second mrs brent felt compassion for the child and volunteered to take care of it for the night the offer was gladly accepted and you for of course you were the child were taken into mrs brents own room treated with simple remedies and in the morning seemed much better your father your real father seemed quite gratified and preferred a request it was that your new friend would take care of you for a week while he traveled to cincinnati on business after dispatching this he promised to return and resume the care of you paying well for the favor done him mrs brent my predecessor being naturally fond of children readily agreed to this proposal and the child was left behind while the father started for cincinnati here mrs brent paused and philip regarded her with doubt and suspense well he said oh you want to know the rest said mrs brent with an ironical smile you are interested in the story yes madam whether it is true or not there isnt much more to tell said mrs brent a week passed you recovered from your cold and became as lively as ever in fact you seemed to feel quite at home among your new surroundings which was rather unfortunate for your father never came back never came back repeated philip no nor was anything heard from him mr and mrs brent came to the conclusion that the whole thing was prearranged to get rid of you luckily for you they had become attached to you and having no children of their own decided to retain you of course some story had to be told to satisfy the villagers you were represented to be the son of a friend and this was readily believed when however my late husband left ohio and traveled some hundreds of miles eastward to this place he dropped this explanation and represented you as his own son romantic wasnt it philip looked searchingly at the face of his stepmother or the woman whom he had regarded as such but he could read nothing to contradict the story in her calm impassive countenance a great fear fell upon him that she might be telling the truth his features showed his contending emotions but he had a profound distrust as well as dislike of his stepmother and he could not bring himself to put confidence in what she told him what proof is there of this he asked after a while your fathers word i mean of course mr brents word he told me this story before i married him feeling that i had a right to know why didnt he tell me asked philip incredulously he thought it would make you unhappy you didnt mind that said philip his lips curling no answered mrs brent with a curious smile why should i i never pretended to like you and now i have less cause than ever after your brutal treatment of my boy jonas endeavored to look injured but could not at once change the expression of his countenance your explanation is quite satisfactory mrs brent returned philip i dont think i stood much higher in your estimation yesterday than today so that i havent lost much but you havent given me any proof yet wait a minute mrs brent left the room went upstairs and speedily returned bringing with her a small daguerreotype representing a boy of three years did you ever see this before she asked no answered philip taking it from her hand and eying it curiously when mr and mrs brent decided that you were to be left on their hands she proceeded they had this picture of you taken in the same dress in which you came to them with a view to establish your identity if at any time afterward inquiry should be made for you the daguerreotype represented a bright handsome child dressed tastefully and more as would be expected of a city child than of one born in the country there was enough resemblance to philip as he looked now to convince him that it was really his picture i have something more to show you said mrs brent she produced a piece of white paper in which the daguerreotype had been folded upon it was some writing and philip readily recognized the hand of the man whom he had regarded as his father he read these lines this is the picture of the boy who was mysteriously left in the charge of mr brent april and never reclaimed l have reared him as my own son but think it best to enter this record of the way in which he came into my hands and to preserve by the help of art his appearance at the time he first came to us gerald brent do you recognize this handwriting asked mrs brent yes answered philip in a dazed tone perhaps she said triumphantly you will doubt my word now may i have this picture asked philip without answering her yes you have as good a claim to it as any one and the paper the paper i prefer to keep myself said mrs brent nodding her head suspiciously i dont care to have my only proof destroyed philip did not seem to take her meaning but with the daguerreotype in his hand he left the room i say mother chuckled jonas his freckled face showing his enjoyment its a good joke on phil isnt it i guess he wont be quite so uppish after this chapter iii phils sudden resolution when phil left the presence of mrs brent he felt as if he had been suddenly transported to a new world he was no longer philip brent and the worst of it was that he did not know who he was in his tumultuous state of feeling however one thing seemed clear his prospects were wholly changed and his plans for the future also mrs brent had told him that he was wholly dependent upon her well he did not intend to remain so his home had not been pleasant at the best as a dependent upon the bounty of such a woman it would be worse he resolved to leave home and strike out for himself not from any such foolish idea of independence as sometimes leads boys to desert a good home for an uncertain skirmish with the world but simply be cause he felt now that he had no real home to begin with he would need money and on opening his pocketbook he ascertained that his available funds consisted of only a dollar and thirtyseven cents that wasnt quite enough to begin the world with but he had other resources he owned a gun which a friend of his would be ready to take off his hands he had a boat also which he could probably sell on the village street he met reuben gordon a young journeyman carpenter who was earning good wages and had money to spare how are you phil said reuben in a friendly way you are just the one i want to meet said phil earnestly didnt you tell me once you would like to buy my gun yes want to sell it no i dont but i want the money it will bring so ill sell it if youll buy what dye want for it asked reuben cautiously six dollars too much ill give five you can have it said phil after a pause how soon can you let me have the money bring the gun round tonight and ill pay you for it all right do you know of any one who wants to buy a boat what going to sell that too yes seems to me youre closin up business said reuben shrewdly so i am im going to leave planktown you dont say well i declare where are you goin to new york i guess got any prospect there yes this was not perhaps strictly true that is phil had no definite prospect but he felt that there must be a chance in a large city like new york for any one who was willing to work and so felt measurably justified in saying what he did i hadnt thought of buyin a boat said reuben thoughtfully phil pricked up his ears at the hint of a possible customer youd better buy mine he said quickly ill sell it cheap how cheap ten dollars thats too much it cost me fifteen but its secondhand now you know said reuben its just as good as new im taking off five dollars though you see i dont think i want it enough to pay ten dollars what will you give reuben finally agreed to pay seven dollars and seventyfive cents after more or less bargaining and to pay the money that evening upon delivery of the goods i dont think ive got anything more to sell said phil thoughtfully theres my skates but they are not very good ill give them to tommy kavanagh he cant afford to buy a pair tommy was the son of a poor widow and was very much pleased with the gift which phil conveyed to him just before supper just after supper he took his gun and the key of his boat over to reuben gordon who thereupon gave him the money agreed upon shall i tell mrs brent i am going away phil said to himself or shall i leave a note for her he decided to announce his resolve in person to do otherwise would seem too much like running away and that he had too much selfrespect to do so in the evening after his return from reuben gordons he said to mrs brent i think i ought to tell you that im going away tomorrow mrs brent looked up from her work and her cold gray eyes surveyed phil with curious scrutiny you are going away she replied where are you going i think i shall go to new york what for seek my fortune as so many have done before me they didnt always find it said mrs brent with a cold sneer is there any other reason yes its chiefly on account of what you told me yesterday you said that i was dependent upon you so you are and that i wasnt even entitled to the name of brent yes i said it and its true well said phil i dont want to be dependent upon you i prefer to earn my own living i am not prepared to say but that you are right but do you know what the neighbors will say what will they say that i drove you from home it wont be true i dont pretend to enjoy my home but i suppose i can stay on here if i like yes you can stay you dont object to my going no if it is understood that you go of your own accord i am willing enough to take the blame of it if there is any blame very well get a sheet of notepaper and write at my direction phil took a sheet of notepaper from his fathers desk and sat down to comply with mrs brents request she dictated as follows i leave home at my own wish but with the consent of mrs brent to seek my fortune it is wholly my own idea and i hold no one else responsible philip brent you may as well keep the name of brent said his stepmother as you have no other that you know of phil winced at those cold words it was not pleasant to reflect that this was so and that he was wholly ignorant of his parentage one thing more said mrs brent it is only eight oclock i should like to have you go out and call upon some of those with whom you are most intimate and tell them that you are leaving home voluntarily i will answered phil perhaps you would prefer to do so tomorrow no i am going away tomorrow morning very well going away tomorrow morning repeated jonas who entered the room at that moment phils plan was briefly disclosed then give me your skates said jonas i cant ive given them to tommy kavanagh thats mean you might have thought of me first grumbled jonas i dont know why tommy kavanagh is my friend and you are not anyway you can let me have your boat and gun i have sold them thats too bad i dont know why you should expect them i needed the money they brought me to pay my expenses till i get work i will pay your expenses to new york if you wish said mrs brent thank you but i shall have money enough answered phil who shrank from receiving any favor at the hands of mrs brent as you please but you will do me the justice to remember that i offered it thank you i shall not forget it that evening just before going to bed mrs brent opened a trunk and drew from it a folded paper she read as follows for it was her husbands will to the boy generally known as philip brent and supposed though incorrectly to be my son i bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian to hold in trust for him till he attains the age of twentyone he need never know of this said mrs brent to herself in a low tone i will save it for jonas she held the paper a moment as if undecided whether to destroy it but finally put it carefully back in the secret hidingplace from which she had taken it he is leaving home of his own accord she whispered henceforth he will probably keep away that suits me well but no one can say i drove him to it chapter iv mr lionel lake six months before it might have cost philip a pang to leave home then his father was living and from him the boy had never received aught but kindness even his stepmother though she secretly disliked him did not venture to show it and secure in the affections of his supposed father he did not trouble himself as to whether mrs brent liked him or not as for jonas he was cautioned by his mother not to get himself into trouble by treating phil badly and the boy who knew on which side his interests lay faithfully obeyed it was only after the death of mr brent that both jonas and his mother changed their course and thought it safe to snub philip planktown was seventyfive miles distant from new york and the fare was two dollars and a quarter this was rather a large sum to pay considering phils scanty fund but he wished to get to the great city as soon as possible and he decided that it would be actually cheaper to ride than to walk considering that he would have to buy his meals on the way he took his seat in the cars placing a valise full of underclothes on the seat next him the train was not very full and the seat beside him did not appear to be required mile after mile they sped on the way and phil looked from the window with interest at the towns through which they passed there are very few boys of his age sixteen who do not like to travel in the cars limited as were his means and uncertain as were his prospects phil felt not only cheerful but actually buoyant as every minute took him farther away from planktown and so nearer the city where he hoped to make a living at the outset and perhaps his fortune in the end presently perhaps half way on a young man rather stylishly dressed came into the car it was not at a station and therefore it seemed clear that he came from another car he halted when he reached the seat which phil occupied our hero observing that his glance rested on his valise politely removed it saying would you like to sit down here sir yes thank you answered the young man and sank into the seat beside phil sorry to inconvenience you he said with a glance at the bag oh not at all returned phil i only put the valise on the seat till it was wanted by some passenger you are more considerate than some passengers observed the young man in the next car is a woman an elderly party who is taking up three extra seats to accommodate her bags and boxes that seems rather selfish remarked phil selfish i should say so i paused a minute at her seat as i passed along and she was terribly afraid i wanted to sit down she didnt offer to move anything though as you have i stopped long enough to make her feel uncomfortable and then passed on i dont think i have fared any the worse for doing so i would rather sit beside you than her am i to consider that a compliment asked phil smiling well yes if you choose not that it is saying much to call you more agreeable company than the old party alluded to are you going to new york yes sir live there i expect to live there brought up in the country perhaps yes in planktown oh planktown ive heard its a nice place but never visited it got any folks phil hesitated in the light of the revelation that had been made to him by mrs brent he did not know how to answer however there was no call to answer definitely not many he said goin to school in new york no to college perhaps ive got a cousin in columbia college i wish i knew enough to go to college said phil but i only know a little latin and no greek at all well i never cared much about latin or greek myself i presume you are thinking about a business position yes i shall try to get a place you may find a little time necessary to find one however you are no doubt able to pay your board for awhile for a short time said phil well i may be able to help you to a place i know a good many prominent business men i should be grateful to you for any help of that kind said phil deciding that he was in luck to meet with such a friend dont mention it i have had to struggle myself in earlier days though at present i am well fixed what is your name philip brent good my name is lionel lake sorry i havent got any cards perhaps i may have one in my pocketbook let me see mr lake opened his portemonnaie and uttered a exclamation of surprise by jove he said i am in a fix phil looked at him inquiringly i took out a roll of bills at the house of my aunt where i stayed last night explained mr lake and must have neglected to replace them i hope you have not lost them said phil politely oh no my aunt will find them and take care of them for me so that i shall get them back the trouble is that i am left temporarily without funds but you can get money in the city suggested phil no doubt only it is necessary for me to stay over a train ten miles short of the city mr lionel lake seemed very much perplexed if i knew some one in the cars he said reflectively it did occur to phil to offer to loan him something but the scantiness of his own resources warned him that it would not be prudent so he remained silent finally mr lake appeared to have an idea have you got five dollars philip he said familiarly yes sir answered philip slowly then ill make a proposal lend it to me and i will give you this ring as security it is worth twentyfive dollars easily he drew from his vestpocket a neat gold ring with some sort of a stone in the setting there said mr lake ill give you this ring and my address and you can bring it to my office tomorrow morning ill give you back the five dollars and one dollar for the accommodation thats good interest isnt it but i might keep the ring and sell it suggested phil oh i am not afraid you look honest i will trust you said the young man in a careless offhand manner say is it a bargain yes answered phil it occurred to him that he could not earn a dollar more easily besides he would be doing a favor to this very polite young man all right then five dollars of phils scanty hoard was handed to mr lake who in return gave phil the ring which he put on his finger he also handed phil a scrap of paper on which he penciled lionel lake no broadway im ever so much obliged he said goodby i get out at the next station phil was congratulating himself on his good stroke of business when the conductor entered the car followed by a young lady when they came to where phil was seated the young lady said that is my ring on that boys finger aha weve found the thief then said the conductor boy give up the ring you stole from this young lady as he spoke he placed his hand on phils shoulder stole repeated phil gasping i dont understand you oh yes you do said the conductor roughly chapter v an overbearing conductor no matter how honest a boy may be a sudden charge of theft is likely to make him look confused and guilty such was the case with phil i assure you he said earnestly that i did not steal this ring where did you get it then demanded the conductor roughly he was one of those men who in any position will make themselves disagreeable moreover he was a man who always thought ill of others when there was any chance of doing so in fact he preferred to credit his fellows with bad qualities rather than with good it was handed me by a young man who just left the car said phil thats a likely story sneered the conductor young men are not in the habit of giving valuable rings to strangers he did not give it to me i advanced him five dollars on it what was the young mans name asked the conductor incredulously theres his name and address answered phil drawing from his pocket the paper handed him by mr lake lionel lake broadway repeated the conductor if there is any such person which i very much doubt you are probably a confederate of his you have no right to say this returned phil indignantly i havent havent i snapped the conductor do you know what i am going to do with you if you wish me to return the ring to this young lady i will do so if she is positive it is hers yes you must do that but it wont get you out of trouble i shall hand you over to a policeman as soon as we reach new york phil was certainly dismayed for he felt that it might be difficult for him to prove that he came honestly in possession of the ring the fact is added the conductor your story is too thin conductor said a new voice you are doing the boy an injustice the speaker was an old man with gray hair but of form still robust though he was at least sixty five he sat in the seat just behind phil thank you sir said phil gratefully i understand my business said the conductor impertinently and dont need any instructions from you young man said the old gentleman in a very dignified tone i have usually found officials of your class polite and gentlemanly but you are an exception who are you asked the conductor rudely what right have you to put in your oar as to who i am i will answer you by and by in reference to the boy i have to say that his story is correct i heard the whole conversation between him and the young man from whom he received the ring and i can testify that he has told the truth at any rate he has received stolen property not knowing it to be stolen the young man was an entire stranger to him and though i suspected that he was an unscrupulous adventurer the boy has not had experience enough to judge men very well if hes innocent he can prove it when hes brought to trial said the conductor as for you sir its none of your business young man you asked me a short time since who i am do you want to know i am not very particular then sir i have to inform you that i am richard grant the president of this road the conductors face was a curious and interesting study when he heard this announcement he knew that the old man whom he had insulted had a right to discharge him from his position and bully as he had shown himself he was now inclined to humble himself to save his place i beg your pardon sir he said in a composed tone if i had known who you were i wouldnt have spoken as i did i had a claim to be treated like a gentleman even if i had no connection with the road he said if you say the boys all right i wont interfere with him continued the conductor my testimony would clear him from any charge that might be brought against him said the president i saw him enter the car and know he has had no opportunity to take the ring if hell give me back the ring thats all i want said the young lady that i am willing to do though i lose five dollars by it said philip do so my boy said the president i take it for granted that the young ladys claim is a just one upon this philip drew the ring from his finger and handed it to the young lady who went back to the car where her friends were sitting i hope sir said the conductor anxiously that you wont be prejudiced against me on account of this affair i am sorry to say that i cant help feeling prejudiced against you returned the president dryly but i wont allow this feeling to injure you if upon inquiring i find that you are otherwise an efficient officer thank you sir i am glad that my presence has saved this boy from being the victim of an injustice let this be a lesson to you in future the conductor walked away looking quite chopfallen and philip turned to his new friend i am very much indebted to you sir he said but for you i should have found myself in serious trouble i am glad to have prevented an injustice my lad i am sorry i could not save you from loss also that enterprising rogue has gone off with five dollars belonging to you i hope the loss will not be a serious one to you it was more than a third part of my capital sir said phil rather ruefully i am sorry for that i suppose however you are not dependent upon your own resources yes sir i am have you no parents then asked mr grant with interest no sir that is i have a stepmother and what are your plans if you are willing to tell me i am going to new york to try to make a living i cannot commend your plan my young friend unless there is a good reason for it i think there is a good reason for it sir i hope you have not run away from home no sir i left home with my stepmothers knowledge and consent that is well i dont want wholly to discourage you and so i will tell you that i too came to new york at your age with the same object in view with less money in my pocket than you possess and now you are the president of a railroad said phil hopefully yes but i had a hard struggle before i reached that position i am not afraid of hard work sir that is in your favor perhaps you may be as lucky as i have been you may call at my office in the city if you feel inclined as mr grant spoke he put in phils hand a card bearing his name and address in wall street thank you sir said phil gratefully i shall be glad to call i may need advice if you seek advice and follow it you will be an exception to the general rule said the president smiling one thing more you have met with a loss which to you is a serious one allow me to bear it and accept this bill but sir it is not right that you should bear it commenced phil then looking at the bill he said havent you made a mistake this is a tendollar bill i know it accept the other five as an evidence of my interest in you by the way i go to philadelphia and washington before my return to new york and shall not return for three or four days after that time you will find me at my office i am in luck after all thought phil cheerfully in spite of the mean trick of mr lionel lake chapter vi signor orlando so phil reached new york in very fair spirits he found himself thanks to the liberality of mr grant in a better financial position than when he left home as he left the depot and found himself in the streets of new york he felt like a stranger upon the threshold of a new life he knew almost nothing about the great city he had entered and was at a loss where to seek for lodgings its a cold day said a sociable voice at his elbow looking around phil saw that the speaker was a sallowcomplexioned young man with black hair and mustache a loose black felt hat crushed at the crown giving him rather a rakish look yes sir answered phil politely stranger in the city i expect yes sir never mind the sir i aint used to ceremony i am signor orlando signor orlando repeated phil rather puzzled are you an italian well yes returned signor orlando with a wink thats what i am or what people think me but i was born in vermont and am half irish and half yankee how did you come by your name then i took it answered his companion you see dear boy im a professional a what a professional singer and clogdancer i believe i am pretty well known to the public continued signor orlando complacently last summer i traveled with jenks browns circus of course youve heard of them through the winter i am employed at bowermans varieties in the bowery i appear every night and at two matinees weekly it must be confessed that phil was considerably impressed by the professional character of signor orlando he had never met an actor or public performer of any description and was disposed to have a high respect for a man who filled such a conspicuous position there was not to be sure anything very impressive about signor orlandos appearance his face did not indicate talent and his dress was shabby but for all that he was a man familiar with the public a man of gifts i should like to see you on the stage said phil respectfully so you shall my dear boy so you shall ill get you a pass from mr bowerman which way are you going i dont know answered phil puzzled i should like to find a cheap boardinghouse but i dont know the city i do answered signor orlando promptly why not come to my house have you a house i mean my boardinghouse its some distance away suppose we take a horsecar all right answered phil relieved to find a guide in the labyrinth of the great city i live on fifth street near the bowery a very convenient location said orlando if we may take the liberty to call him thus fifth avenue asked phil who did not know the difference oh no thats a peg above my style i am not a vanderbilt nor yet an astor is the price moderate asked phil anxiously i must make my money last as long as i can for i dont know when i shall get a place to be sure you might room with me only ive got a hall bedroom perhaps we might manage it though i think i should prefer a room by myself said phil who reflected that signor orlando was a stranger as yet oh well ill speak to the old lady and i guess she can accommodate you with a hall bedroom like mine on the third floor what should i have to pay a dollar and a quarter a week and you can get your meals where you please i think that will suit me said phil thoughtfully after leaving the car a minutes walk brought them to a shabby threestory house of brick there was a stable opposite and a group of dirty children were playing in front of it this is where i hang out said signor orlando cheerfully as the poet says there is no place like home if this had been true it was not much to be regretted since the home in question was far from attractive signor orlando rang the bell and a stout woman of german aspect answered the call so you haf come back herr orlando said this lady i hope you haf brought them two weeks rent you owe me all in good time mrs schlessinger said orlando but you see i have brought some one with me is he your bruder now asked the lady no he is not unfortunately for me his name is orlando coughed philip brent suggested our hero just so philip brent i am glad to see mr prent said the landlady and is he an actor like you signor orlando not yet we dont know what may happen but he comes on business mrs schlessinger he wants a room the landlady brightened up she had two rooms vacant and a new lodger was a godsend i vill show mr prent what rooms i haf she said come upstairs mr prent the good woman toiled up the staircase panting for she was asthmatic and phil followed the interior of the house was as dingy as the exterior and it was quite dark on the second landing she threw open the door of a back room which being lower than the hall was reached by a step there said she pointing to the faded carpet rumpled bed and cheap pine bureau with the little sixbyten lookingglass surmounting it this is a peautiful room for a single gentleman or even for a man and his wife my friend mr brent is not married said signor orlando waggishly phil laughed you will have your shoke signor orlando said mrs schlessinger what is the price of this room asked phil three dollars a week mr prent i ought to have four but since you are a steady young gentleman how does she know that phil wondered since you are a steady young gentleman and a friend of signor orlando i will not ask you full price that is more than i can afford to pay said phil shaking his head i think you had better show mr brent the hall bedroom over mine suggested the signor mrs schlessinger toiled up another staircase the two new acquaintances following her she threw open the door of one of those depressing cells known in new york as a hall bedroom it was about five feet wide and eight feet long and was nearly filled up by a cheap bedstead covered by a bed about two inches thick and surmounted at the head by a consumptivelooking pillow the paper was torn from the walls in places there was one rickety chair and a washstand which bore marks of extreme antiquity this is a very neat room for a single gentleman remarked mrs schlessinger phils spirits fell as he surveyed what was to be his future home it was a sad contrast to his neat comfortable room at home is this room like yours signor orlando he asked faintly as like as two peas answered orlando would you recommend me to take it you couldnt do better how could the signor answer otherwise in presence of a landlady to whom he owed two weeks rent then said phil with a secret shudder ill take it if the rent is satisfactory a dollar and a quarter a week said mrs schlessinger promptly ill take it for a week you wont mind paying in advance suggested the landlady i pay my own rent in advance phils answer was to draw a dollar and a quarter from his purse and pass it to his landlady ill take possession now said our hero can i have some water to wash my face mrs schlessinger was evidently surprised that any one should want to wash in the middle of the day but made no objections when phil had washed his face and hands he went out with signor orlando to dine at a restaurant on the bowery chapter vii bowermans varieties the restaurant to which he was taken by signor orlando was thronged with patrons for it was one oclock on the whole they did not appear to belong to the highest social rank though they were doubtless respectable the tablecloths were generally soiled and the waiters had a greasy look phil said nothing but he did not feel quite so hungry as before he entered the signor found two places at one of the tables and they sat down phil examined a greasy bill of fare and found that he could obtain a plate of meat for ten cents this included bread and butter and a dish of mashed potato a cup of tea would be five cents additional i can afford fifteen cents for a meal he thought and called for a plate of roast beef corn beef and cabbage for me said the signor its very filling he remarked aside to phil they wont give you but a mouthful of beef so it proved but the quality was such that phil did not care for more he ordered a piece of apple pie afterward feeling still hungry i see youre bound to have a square meal said the signor after phil had had it he was bound to confess that he did not feel uncomfortably full yet he had spent twice as much as the signor who dispensed with the tea and pie as superfluous luxuries in the evening signor orlando bent his steps toward bowermans varieties i hope in a day or two to get a complimentary ticket for you mr brent he said how much is the ticket asked phil fifteen cents best reserved seats twentyfive cents i believe i will be extravagant for once said phil and go at my own expense good said the signor huskily youll feel repaid ill be bound bowerman always gives the public their moneys worth the performance begins at eight oclock and wont be out until halfpast eleven less than five cents an hour commented phil what a splendid head youve got said signor orlando admiringly i couldnt have worked that up figures aint my province it seemed to phil rather a slender cause for compliment but he said nothing since it seemed clear that the computation was beyond his companions ability as to the performance it was not refined nor was the talent employed firstclass still phil enjoyed himself after a fashion he had never had it in his power to attend many amusements and this was new to him he naturally looked with interest for the appearance of his new friend and fellowlodger signor orlando appeared dressed in gorgeous array sang a song which did credit to the loudness of his voice rather than its quality and ended by a noisy clogdance which elicited much applause from the boys in the gallery who shared the evenings entertainment for the moderate sum of ten cents the signor was called back to the stage he bowed his thanks and gave another dance then he was permitted to retire as this finished his part of the entertainment he afterward came around in citizens dress and took a seat in the auditorium beside phil how did you like me mr brent he asked complacently i thought you did well signor orlando you were much applauded yes the audience is very loyal said the proud performer two halfgrown boys heard phil pronounce the name of his companion and they gazed awestricken at the famous man thats signor orlando whispered one of the others i know it was the reply such is fame said the signor in a pleased tone to phil people point me out on the streets very gratifying no doubt said our hero but it occurred to him that he would not care to be pointed out as a performer at bowermans signor orlando however wellpleased with himself didnt doubt that phil was impressed by his popularity and perhaps even envied it they didnt stay till the entertainment was over it was of course familiar to the signor and phil felt tired and sleepy for he had passed a part of the afternoon in exploring the city and had walked in all several miles he went back to his lodginghouse opened the door with a passkey which mrs schlessinger had given him and climbing to his room in the third story undressed and deposited himself in bed the bed was far from luxurious a thin pallet rested on slats so thin that he could feel the slats through it and the covering was insufficient the latter deficiency he made up by throwing his overcoat over the quilt and despite the hardness of his bed he was soon sleeping soundly tomorrow i must look for a place he said to signor orlando can you give me any advise yes my dear boy buy a daily paper the sun or herald and look at the advertisements there may be some prominent business man who is looking out for a boy of your size phil knew of no better way and he followed signor orlandos advice after a frugal breakfast at the bowery restaurant he invested a few pennies in the two papers mentioned and began to go the rounds the first place was in pearl street he entered and was directed to a desk in the front part of the store you advertised for a boy he said weve got one was the brusque reply of course no more was to be said and phil walked out a little dashed at his first rebuff at the next place he found some half a dozen boys waiting and joined the line but the vacancy was filled before his turn came at the next place his appearance seemed to make a good impression and he was asked several questions what is your name philip brent how old are you just sixteen how is your education i have been to school since i was six then you ought to know something have you ever been in a place no sir do you live with your parents no sir i have just come to the city and am lodging in fifth street then you wont do we wish our boys to live with their parents poor phil he had allowed himself to hope that at length he was likely to get a place the abrupt termination of the conversation dispirited him he made three more applications in one of them he again came near succeeding but once more the fact that he did not live with his parents defeated his application it seems to be very hard getting a place thought phil and it must be confessed he felt a little homesick i wont make any more applications today he decided and being on broadway walked up that busy thoroughfare wondering what the morrow would bring forth it was winter and there was ice on the sidewalk directly in front of phil walked an elderly gentleman whose suit of fine broadcloth and gold spectacles seemed to indicate a person of some prominence and social importance suddenly he set foot on a treacherous piece of ice vainly he strove to keep his equilibrium his arms waving wildly and his goldheaded cane falling to the sidewalk he would have fallen backward had not phil observing his danger in time rushed to his assistance chapter viii the house in twelfth street with some difficulty the gentleman righted himself and then phil picked up his cane i hope you are not hurt sir he said i should have been but for you my good boy said the gentleman i am a little shaken by the suddenness of my slipping would you wish me to go with you sir yes if you please i do not perhaps require you but i shall be glad of your company thank you sir do you live in the city yes sir that is i propose to do so i have come here in search of employment phil said this thinking it possible that the old gentleman might exert his influence in his favor are you dependent on what you may earn asked the gentleman regarding him attentively i have a little money sir but when that is gone i shall need to earn something that is no misfortune it is a good thing for a boy to be employed otherwise he is liable to get into mischief at any rate i shall be glad to find work sir have you applied anywhere yet phil gave a little account of his unsuccessful applications and the objections that had been made to him yes yes said the old gentleman thoughtfully more confidence is placed in a boy who lives with his parents the two walked on together until they reached twelfth street it was a considerable walk and phil was surprised that his companion should walk when he could easily have taken a broadway stage but the old gentleman explained this himself i find it does me good he said to spend some time in the open air and even if walking tires me it does me good at twelfth street they turned off i am living with a married niece he said just on the other side of fifth avenue at the door of a handsome fourstory house with a brownstone front the old gentleman paused and told phil that this was his residence then sir i will bid you goodmorning said phil no no come in and lunch with me said mr carter hospitably he had by the way mentioned that his name was oliver carter and that he was no longer actively engaged in business but was a silent partner in the firm of which his nephew by marriage was the nominal head thank you sir answered phil he was sure that the invitation was intended to be accepted and he saw no reason why he should not accept it hannah said the old gentleman to the servant who opened the door tell your mistress that i have brought a boy home to dinner with me yes sir answered hannah surveying phil in some surprise come up to my room my young friend said mr carter you may want to prepare for lunch mr carter had two connecting rooms on the second floor one of which he used as a bedchamber the furniture was handsome and costly and phil who was not used to city houses thought it luxurious phil washed his face and hands and brushed his hair then a bell rang and following his new friend he went down to lunch lunch was set out in the front basement when phil and mr carter entered the room a lady was standing by the fire and beside her was a boy of about phils age the lady was tall and slender with lightbrown hair and cold gray eyes lavinia said mr carter i have brought a young friend with me to lunch so i see answered the lady has he been here before no he is a new acquaintance i would speak to him if i knew his name his name is here the old gentleman hesitated for in truth he had forgotten philip brent you may sit down here mr brent said mrs pitkin for this was the ladys name thank you maam and so you made my uncles acquaintance this morning she continued herself taking a seat at the head of the table yes he was of service to me answered mr carter for him i had lost my balance and should have had a heavy fall if philip had not come to my assistance he was very kind i am sure said mrs pitkin but her tone was very cold philip said mr carter this is my grandnephew alonzo pitkin he indicated the boy already referred to how do you do said alonzo staring at philip not very cordially very well thank you answered philip politely where do you live asked alonzo after a moments hesitation in fifth street thats near the bowery isnt it yes the boy shrugged his shoulders and exchanged a significant look with his mother fifth street was not a fashionable street indeed quite the reverse and phils answer showed that he was a nobody phil himself had begun to suspect that he was unfashionably located but he felt that until his circumstances improved he might as well remain where he was but though he lived in an unfashionable street it could not be said that phil in his table manners showed any lack of good breeding he seemed quite at home at mrs pitkins table and in fact acted with greater propriety than alonzo who was addicted to fast eating and greediness couldnt you walk home alone uncle oliver asked mrs pitkin presently yes then it was a pity to trouble mr brent to come with you it was no trouble responded philip promptly though he suspected that it was not consideration for him that prompted the remark yes i admit that i was a little selfish in taking up my young friends time said the old gentleman cheerfully but i infer from what he tells me that it is not particularly valuable just now are you in a business position mr brent asked mrs pitkin no madam i was looking for a place this morning have you lived for some time in the city no i came here only yesterday from the country i think country boys are very foolish to leave good homes in the country to seek places in the city said mrs pitkin sharply there may be circumstances lavinia that make it advisable suggested mr carter who however did not know phils reason for coming no doubt i understand that answered mrs pitkin in a tone so significant that phil wondered whether she thought he had got into any trouble at home and besides we cant judge for every one so i hope master philip may find some good and satisfactory opening now that he has reached the city after a short time lunch which in new york is generally a plain meal was over and mr carter invited philip to come upstairs again i want to talk over your prospects philip he said there was silence till after the two had left the room then mrs pitkin said alonzo i dont like this what dont you like ma uncle bringing this boy home it is very extraordinary this sudden interest in a perfect stranger do you think hell leave him any money asked alonzo betraying interest i dont know what it may lead to lonny but it dont look right such things have been known id like to punch the boys head remarked alonzo with sudden hostility all uncles money ought to come to us so it ought by rights observed his mother we must see that this boy doesnt get any ascendency over him phil would have been very much amazed if he had overheard this conversation chapter ix the old gentleman proves a friend the old gentleman sat down in an armchair and waved his hand toward a small rockingchair in which phil seated himself i conclude that you had a good reason for leaving home philip said mr carter eying our hero with a keen but friendly look yes sir since my fathers death it has not been a home to me is there a stepmother in the case asked the old gentleman shrewdly yes sir any one else she has a son and you two dont agree you seem to know all about it sir said phil surprised i know something of the world that is all phil began to think that mr carters knowledge of the world was very remarkable he began to wonder whether he could know anything more could suspect the secret which mrs brent had communicated to him should he speak of it he decided at any rate to wait for mr carter though kind was a comparative stranger well continued the old gentleman i wont inquire too minutely into the circumstances you dont look like a boy that would take such an important step as leaving home without a satisfactory reason the next thing is to help you phils courage rose as he heard these words mr carter was evidently a rich man and he could help him if he was willing so he kept silence and let his new friend do the talking you want a place continued mr carter now what are you fit for that is a hard question for me to answer sir i dont know have you a good education yes sir and i know something of latin and french besides you can write a good hand shall i show you sir yes write a few lines at my private desk phil did so and handed the paper to mr carter very good said the old gentleman approvingly that is in your favor are you good at accounts yes sir better still sit down there again he continued i will give you a sum in interest phil resumed his seat what is the interest of eight hundred and fortyfive dollars and sixty cents for four years three months and twelve days at eight and onehalf per cent phils pen moved fast in perfect silence for five minutes then he announced the result let me look at the paper i will soon tell you whether it is correct after a brief examination for the old gentleman was himself an adept at figures he said with a beaming smile it is entirely correct you are a smart boy thank you sir said phil gratified and you deserve a good place better than you will probably get phil listened attentively the last clause was not quite so satisfactory yes said mr carter evidently talking to himself i must get pitkin to take him phil knew that the lady whom he had already met was named pitkin and he rightly concluded that it was her husband who was meant i hope he is more agreeable than his wife thought philip yes philip said mr carter who had evidently made up his mind i will try to find you a place this afternoon i shall be very much obliged sir said philip gladly i have already told you that my nephew and i are in business together he being the active and i the silent partner we do a general shipping business our store is on franklin street i will give you a letter to my nephew and he will give you a place thank you sir wait a minute and i will write the note five minutes later phil was on his way down town with his credentials in his pocket chapter x phil calls on mr pitkin phil paused before an imposing business structure and looked up to see if he could see the sign that would show him he had reached his destination he had not far to look on the front of the building he saw in large letters the sign enoch pitkin co in the doorway there was another sign from which he learned that the firm occupied the second floor he went upstairs and opening a door entered a spacious apartment which looked like a hive of industry there were numerous clerks counters piled with goods and every indication that a prosperous business was being carried on the nearest person was a young man of eighteen or perhaps more with an incipient strawcolored mustache and a shock of hair of towcolor this young man wore a variegated necktie a stiff standingcollar and a suit of clothes in the extreme of fashion phil looked at him hesitatingly the young man observed the look and asked condescendingly what can i do for you my son such an address from a person less than three years older than himself came near upsetting the gravity of phil is mr pitkin in he asked yes i believe so can i see him i have no objection remarked the young man facetiously where shall i find him the youth indicated a small room partitioned off as a private office in the extreme end of the store thank you said phil and proceeded to find his way to the office in question arrived at the door which was partly open he looked in in an armchair sat a small man with an erect figure and an air of consequence he was not over fortyfive but looked older for his cheeks were already seamed and his look was querulous cheerful natures do not so soon show signs of age as their opposites mr pitkin said phil interrogatively well said the small man frowning instinctively i have a note for you sir phil stepped forward and handed the missive to mr pitkin the latter opened it quickly and read as follows the boy who will present this to you did me a service this morning he is in want of employment he seems well educated but if you cant offer him anything better than the post of errand boy do so i will guarantee that he will give satisfaction you can send him to the postoffice and to other offices on such errands as you may have pay him five dollars a week and charge that sum to me yours truly oliver carter mr pitkins frown deepened as he read this note pish he ejaculated in a tone which though low was audible to phil uncle oliver must be crazy what is your name he demanded fiercely turning suddenly to phil philip brent when did you meet the gentleman who gave you this letter phil told him do you know what is in this letter i suppose sir it is a request that you give me a place did you read it no answered phil indignantly humph he wants me to give you the place of errand boy i will try to suit you sir when do you want to begin as soon as possible sir come tomorrow morning and report to me first another freak of uncle olivers he muttered as he turned his back upon phil and so signified that the interview was at an end chapter xi phil enters upon his duties phil presented himself in good season the next morning at the store in franklin street as he came up in one direction the youth whom he had seen in the store the previous day came up in the opposite direction the latter was evidently surprised halloo johnny said he whats brought you here again business answered phil going to buy out the firm inquired the youth jocosely not today some other day then said the young man laughing as if he had said a very witty thing as phil didnt know that this form of expression slightly varied had become a popular phrase of the day he did not laugh do you belong to the church asked the youth stopping short in his own mirth what makes you ask because you dont laugh i would if i saw anything to laugh at come thats hard on me honor bright have you come to do any business with us it is rather amusing to see how soon the cheapest clerk talks of us quietly identifying himself with the firm that employs him not that i object to it often it implies a personal interest in the success and prosperity of the firm which makes a clerk more valuable this was not however the case with g washington wilbur the young man who was now conversing with phil as will presently appear i am going to work here answered phil simply going to work here repeated mr wilbur in surprise has old pitkin engaged you mr pitkin engaged me yesterday phil replied i didnt know he wanted a boy what are you to do go to the postoffice bank and so on youre to be errand boy then yes thats the way i started said mr wilbur patronizingly what are you now a salesman i wouldnt like to be back in my old position what wages are you going to get five dollars five dollars a week ejaculated mr g washington wilbur in amazement come youre chaffing why should i do that is that anything remarkable i should say it was answered mr wilbur slowly didnt you get as much when you were errand boy i only got two dollars and a half did pitkin tell you he would pay you five dollars a week no mr carter told me so the old gentleman mr pitkins uncle yes it was at his request that mr pitkin took me on mr wilbur looked grave its a shame he commenced what is a shame that i should get five dollars a week no but that i should only get a dollar a week more than an errand boy im worth every cent of ten dollars a week but the old man only gives me six it hardly keeps me in gloves and cigars wont he give you any more no only last month i asked him for a raise and he told me if i wasnt satisfied i might go elsewhere you didnt no but i mean to soon i will show old pitkin that he cant keep a man of my experience for such a paltry salary i dare say that denning or claflin would be glad to have me and pay me what i am worth phil did not want to laugh but when mr wilbur who looked scarcely older than himself and was in appearance but a callow youth referred to himself as a man of experience he found it hard to resist hadnt we better be going up stairs asked phil all right follow me said mr wilbur and ill take you to the superintendent of the room i am to report to mr pitkin himself i believe he wont be here yet awhile said wilbur but just then up came mr wilbur himself fully half an hour earlier than usual phil touched his hat politely and said goodmorning goodmorning returned his employer regarding him sharply are you the boy i hired yesterday yes sir come upstairs then phil followed mr pitkin upstairs and they walked together through the salesroom i hope you understand said mr pitkin brusquely that i have engaged you at the request of mr carter and to oblige him i feel grateful to mr carter said phil not quite knowing what was coming next i shouldnt myself have engaged a boy of whom i knew nothing and who could give me no city references i hope you wont be disappointed in me said phil i hope not answered mr pitkin in a tone which seemed to imply that he rather expected to be phil began to feel uncomfortable it seemed evident that whatever he did would be closely scrutinized and that in an unfavorable spirit mr pitkin paused before a desk at which was standing a stout man with grayish hair mr sanderson he said this is the new errand boy his name is what is it boy philip brent you will give him something to do has the mail come in no we havent sent to the postoffice yet you may send this boy at once mr sanderson took from the desk a key and handed it to philip that is the key to our box he said notice the number open it and bring the mail dont loiter on the way yes sir philip took the key and left the warehouse when he reached the street he said to himself i wonder where the postoffice is he did not like to confess to mr sanderson that he did not know for it would probably have been considered a disqualification for the post which he was filling i had better walk to broadway he said to himself i suppose the postoffice must be on the principal street in this phil was mistaken at that time the postoffice was on nassau street in an old church which had been utilized for a purpose very different from the one to which it had originally been devoted reaching broadway phil was saluted by a bootblack with a grimy but honestlooking face shine your boots mister said the boy with a grin not this morning some other morning then yes answered phil sorry you wont give me a job said the bootblack my taxes comes due today and i aint got enough to pay em phil was amused for his new acquaintance scarcely looked like a heavy taxpayer do you pay a big tax he asked a thousand dollars or less answered the knight of the brush i guess its less said phil thats where your heads level young chap is the postoffice far from here over half a mile i reckon is it on this street no its on nassau street if you will show me the way there ill give you ten cents all right the walkll do me good come on whats your name asked phil who had become interested in his new acquaintance the boys call me ragged dick it was indeed the lively young bootblack whose history was afterward given in a volume which is probably familiar to many of my readers at this time he was only a bootblack and had not yet begun to feel the spur of that ambition which led to his subsequent prosperity thats a queer name said phil i try to live up to it said dick with a comical glance at his ragged coat which had originally been worn by a man six feet in height he swung his box over his shoulder and led the way to the old postoffice chapter xii mr lionel lake again phil continued his conversation with ragged dick and was much amused by his quaint way of expressing himself when they reached murray street dick said follow me well cut across the city hall park it is the shortest way soon they reached the shabby old building with which new yorkers were then obliged to be content with as a postoffice phil secured the mail matter for pitkin co and was just about leaving the office when he noticed just ahead of him a figure which looked very familiar it flashed upon him of a sudden that it was his old train acquaintance lionel lake he immediately hurried forward and touched his arm mr lake who had several letters in his hand started nervously and turned at the touch he recognized phil but appeared not to do so what do you wish boy he asked loftily i want to speak a word with you mr lake the young man shrugged his shoulders you are mistaken in the person he said my name is not lake very likely not said phil significantly but thats what you called yourself when we met on the train i repeat boy that you are strangely mistaken my name is he paused slightly john montgomery just as you please whatever your name is i have a little business with you i cant stop my business is urgent said lake then i will be brief i lent you five dollars on a ring which i afterward discovered to be stolen i want you to return that money mr lake looked about him apprehensively for he did not wish any one to hear what phil was saying you must be crazy he said i never saw you before in the whole course of my life he shook off phils detaining hand and was about to hurry away but phil said resolutely you cant deceive me mr lake give me that money or i will call a policeman now it happened that a policeman was passing just outside and lake could see him this is an infamous outrage he said but i have an important appointment and cant be detained take the money i give it to you in charity phil gladly received and pocketed the banknote and relinquishing his hold of mr lake rejoined dick who had been an interested eyewitness of the interview i see youve got pluck said dick whats it all about phil told him i aint a bit sprised said dick i could tell by his looks that the man was a skin well im even with him at any rate said phil now ill be getting back to the office thank you for your guidance heres a quarter you only promised me ten cents its worth a quarter i hope to meet you again well meet at astors next party said dick with a grin my invite came yesterday mine hasnt come yet said phil smiling maybe itll come tomorrow hes a queer chap thought phil hes fit for something better than blacking boots i hope hell have the luck to get it phil had been detained by his interview with mr lake but he made up for it by extra speed and reached the warehouse in fair time after delivering the letters he was sent out on another errand and during the entire day he was kept busy leaving him for the moment we go back to the pitkin mansion and listen to conversation between mr and mrs pitkin uncle oliver is getting more and more eccentric every day said the lady he brought home a boy to lunch today some one whom he had picked up in the street was the boys name philip brent asked her husband yes i believe so what do you know about him asked the lady in surprise i have engaged him as errand boy you have what for exclaimed mrs pitkin i couldnt help it he brought a letter from your uncle requesting me to do so and offering to pay his wages out of his own pocket this is really getting very serious said mrs pitkin annoyed suppose he should take a fancy to this boy he appears to have done so already said her husband dryly i mean suppose he should adopt him you are getting on pretty fast lavinia are you not such things happen sometimes said the lady nodding if it should happen it would be bad for poor lonny even in that case lonny wont have to go to the poorhouse mr pitkin you dont realize the danger heres uncle oliver worth a quarter of a million dollars and it ought to be left to us probably it will be he may leave it all to this boy this must be prevented how you must say the boy doesnt suit you and discharge him well well give me time i have no objection but i suspect it will be hard to find any fault with him he looks like a reliable boy to me he looks like an artful young adventurer said mrs pitkin vehemently depend upon it mr pitkin he will spare no pains to ingratiate himself into uncle olivers favor it will be seen that mrs pitkin was gifted if it can be called a gift with a very suspicious temperament she was mean and grasping and could not bear the idea of even a small part of her uncles money going to any one except her own family there was indeed another whose relationship to uncle oliver was as close a cousin who had estranged her relatives by marrying a poor bookkeeper with whom she had gone to milwaukee her name was never mentioned in the pitkin household and mrs pitkin trusting to the distance between them did not apprehend any danger from this source had she known rebecca forbush was even now in new york a widow with one child struggling to make a living by sewing and taking lodgers she would have felt less tranquil but she knew nothing of all this nor did she dream that the boy whom she dreaded was the very next day to make the acquaintance of this despised relation this was the way that it happened phil soon tired of the room he had taken in fifth street it was not neatly kept and was far from comfortable then again he found that the restaurants cheap as they were were likely to absorb about all his salary though the billoffare was far from attractive chance took him through a sidestreet between second and third avenues in the neighborhood of thirteenth street among the three and fourstory buildings that lined the block was one framehouse twostoryandbasement on which he saw a sign board for gentlemen he had seen other similar signs but his attention was specially drawn to this by seeing a pleasantlooking woman enter the house with the air of proprietor this woman recalled to philip his own mother to whom she bore a striking resemblance i would like to board with one whose face recalled that of my dear dead mother thought phil and on the impulse of the moment just after the woman had entered he rang the doorbell the door was opened almost immediately by the woman he had just seen enter it seemed to phil almost as if he were looking into his mothers face and he inquired in an unsteady voice do you take boarders yes was the answer wont you step in chapter xiii phils new home the house was poorly furnished with cheap furniture but there was an unexpected air of neatness about it there is a great difference between respectable and squalid poverty it was the first of these that was apparent in the small house in which our hero found himself i am looking for a boardingplace said philip i cannot afford to pay a high price and i should not think of asking a high price for such plain accommodations as i can offer said mrs forbush what sort of a room do you desire a small room will answer i have a hallbedroom at the head of the stairs will you go up and look at it i should like to do so mrs forbush led the way up a narrow staircase and philip followed her opening the door of the small room referred to she showed a neat bed a chair a washstand and a few hooks from which clothing might be hung it was plain enough but there was an air of neatness which did not characterize his present room i like the room he said brightening up how much do you charge for this room and board four dollars that includes breakfast and supper answered mrs forbush lunch you provide for yourself that will be satisfactory said phil i am in a place down town and i could not come to lunch at any rate when would you like to come mr said the widow interrogatively my name is philip brent mr brent i will come some time tomorrow generally i ask a small payment in advance as a guarantee that an applicant will really come but i am sure i can trust you thank you but i am quite willing to conform to your usual rule said phil as he drew a twodollar bill from his pocket and handed it to the widow so they parted mutually pleased phils week at his present lodging would not be up for several days but he was tired of it and felt that he would be much more comfortable with mrs forbush so he was ready to make the small pecuniary sacrifice needful the conversation which has been recorded took but five minutes and did not materially delay phil who as i have already said was absent from the store on an errand the next day phil became installed at his new boardingplace and presented himself at supper there were three other boarders two being a young salesman at a third avenue store and his wife they occupied a square room on the same floor with phil the other was a female teacher employed in one of the city public schools the only remaining room was occupied by a drummer who was often called away for several days together this comprised the list of boarders but phils attention was called to a young girl of fourteen of sweet and attractive appearance whom he ascertained to be a daughter of mrs forbush the young lady herself julia forbush cast frequent glances at phil who being an unusually goodlooking boy would naturally excite the notice of a young girl on the whole it seemed a pleasant and social circle and phil felt that he had found a home the next day as he was occupied in the store next to g washington wilbur he heard that young man say why theres mr carter coming into the store mr oliver carter instead of making his way directly to the office where mr pitkin was sitting came up to where phil was at work how are you getting along my young friend he asked familiarly very well thank you sir do you find your duties very fatiguing oh no sir i have a comfortable time thats right work cheerfully and you will win the good opinion of your employer dont forget to come up and see me soon thank you sir you seem to be pretty solid with the old man remarked mr wilbur we are on very good terms answered phil smiling i wish you had introduced him to me said wilbur dont you know him asked phil in surprise he doesnt often come to the store and when he does he generally goes at once to the office and the clerks dont have a chance to get acquainted i should hardly like to take the liberty then said phil oh keep him to yourself then if you want to said mr wilbur evidently annoyed i dont care to do that i shall be entirely willing to introduce you when there is a good chance this seemed to appease mr wilbur who became once more gracious philip he said as the hour of closing approached why cant you come around and call upon me this evening so i will answered phil readily indeed he found it rather hard to fill up his evenings and was glad to have a way suggested do i want to tell you a secret where do you live asked phil no east twentysecond street all right i will come round about halfpast seven though wilbur lived in a larger house than he phil did not like his room as well there being only one chair in the room mr wilbur put his visitor in it and himself sat on the bed there was something of a mystery in the young mans manner as after clearing his throat he said to phil i am going to tell you a secret phils curiosity was somewhat stirred and he signified that he would like to hear it i have for some time wanted a confidant said mr wilbur i did not wish to trust a mere acquaintance for ahem the matter is quite a delicate one phil regarded him with increased interest i am flattered by your selecting me said he i will keep your secret phil said mr wilbur in a tragic tone you may be surprised to hear that i am in love phil started and wanted to laugh but mr wilburs serious earnest look restrained him aint you rather young he ventured to say no i am nineteen answered mr wilbur the heart makes no account of years whether this was original or borrowed phil could not tell have you been in love long asked phil three weeks does the lady know it not yet returned mr wilbur i have worshiped her from afar i have never even spoken to her then the matter hasnt gone very far no not yet where did you meet her first in a broadway stage what is her name i dont know you dont know much about her then yes i know where she lives where on lexington avenue whereabouts between twentyninth and thirtieth streets would you like to see her house yes answered phil who saw that mr wilbur wished him so to answer then come out we might see her the two boys for mr wilbur though he considered himself a young man of large experience was really scarcely more than a boy bent their steps to lexington avenue and walked in a northerly direction they had reached twentyeighth street when the door of house farther up on the avenue was opened and a lady came out thats she ejaculated mr wilbur clutching phil by the arm phil looked and saw a tall young lady three or four inches taller than his friend and as many years older he looked at his companion with surprise is that the young lady you are in love with he asked yes isnt she a daisy asked the lover fervently i am not much of a judge of daisies answered phil a little embarrassed for the young lady had large features and was in his eyes very far from pretty chapter xiv consulting the oracle phil did not like to hurt the feelings of his companion and refrained from laughing though with difficulty she doesnt appear to know you he said no said wilbur i havent had a chance to make myself known to her do you think you can make a favorable impression upon the daisy asked phil outwardly sober but inwardly amused i always had a taking way with girls replied mr wilbur complacently phil coughed it was all that saved him from laughing while he was struggling with the inclination the lady inadvertently dropped a small parcel which she had been carrying in her hand the two boys were close behind like an arrow from the bow mr wilbur sprang forward picked up the parcel and while his heart beat wildly said as he tendered it to the owner with a graceful bow and captivating smile miss i believe you dropped this thank you my good boy answered the daisy pleasantly mr wilbur staggered back as if he had been struck he fell back in discomfiture and his face showed the mortification and anguish he felt did you hear what she said he asked in a hollow voice she called you a boy didnt she yes answered mr wilbur sadly perhaps she may be nearsighted said phil consolingly do you think so asked mr wilbur hopefully it is quite possible then you are short you know yes it must be so said g washington wilbur his face more serene if she hadnt been she would have noticed my mustache true she spoke kindly if if she had seen how old i was it would have been different dont you think so yes no doubt there is only one thing to do said mr wilbur in a tone of calm resolve what is that inquired phil in some curiosity i must wear a stovepipe hat as you say i am small and a nearsighted person might easily suppose me to be younger than i am now with a stovepipe hat i shall look much older yes i presume so then i can make her acquaintance again and she will not mistake me phil why dont you wear a stovepipe because i dont want to look any older than i am besides an errandboy wouldnt look well in a tall hat no perhaps not and mr pitkin would hardly like it of course when you are a salesman like me it will be different mr wilbur was beginning to recover his complacency which had been so rudely disturbed i suppose you wouldnt think of marrying on your present salary said phil six dollars a week wouldnt support a married pair very well the firm would raise my salary they always do when a man marries besides i have other resources indeed yes i am worth two thousand dollars it was left me by an aunt and is kept in trust for me until i am twentyone i receive the interest now i congratulate you said phil who was really pleased to hear of his companions good fortune that money will come in handy besides i expect shes got money continued mr wilbur of course i love her for herself alone i am not mercenary still it will be a help when we are married so it will said phil amused at the confident manner in which mr wilbur spoke of marriage with a lady of whom he knew absolutely nothing philip said mr wilbur when i marry i want you to stand up with me to be my groomsman if i am in the city and can afford to buy a dresssuit i might consent thank you you are a true friend said mr wilbur squeezing his hand fervently the two returned to mr wilburs room and had a chat at an early hour phil returned to his own boardingplace as time passed on phil and wilbur spent considerable time together out of the store mr g washington wilbur apart from his amusing traits was a youth of good principles and good disposition and phil was glad of his company sometimes they went to cheap amusements but not often for neither had money to spare for such purposes some weeks after phils entrance upon his duties mr wilbur made a proposal to phil of a startling nature suppose we have our fortunes told phil he said if it would help my fortune or hurry it up i shouldnt object said phil smiling i want to know what fate has in store for me said wilbur do you think the fortunetellers know any better than you do asked phil incredulously they tell some strange things said wilbur what for instance an aunt of mine went to a fortuneteller and asked if she would ever be married and when she was told that she would be married before she was twentytwo to a tall lightcomplexioned man did it come true yes every word said mr wilbur solemnly she was married three months before her twentysecond birthday and her husband was just the kind of man that was predicted wasnt that strange the fortuneteller might easily have guessed all that most girls are married as young as that but not to tall lightcomplexioned men said wilbur triumphantly is there anything you wish particularly to know asked phil i should like to know if i am going to marry you know who the daisy yes phil was not much in favor of the scheme but finally agreed to it there was a certain veiled lady who advertised her qualifications in the herald as the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter and therefore gifted with the power to read the future mr wilbur made choice of her and together they went to call upon her one evening they were shown into an anteroom and in due time mr wilbur was called into the dread presence he was somewhat nervous and agitated but braced up as he afterward expressed it and went in he wanted phil to go in with him but the attendant said that madam would not allow it and he went forward alone fifteen minutes afterward he reentered the room with a radiant face have you heard good news asked phil mr wilbur nodded emphatically and whispered for there were two others in waiting its all right i am to marry her did the fortuneteller say so yes did she give her name no but she described her so that i knew her at once will it be soon asked phil slyly not till i am twentyfour answered mr wilbur soberly but perhaps she may be mistaken about that perhaps she thought i was older than i am do you doubt her knowledge then no at any rate i can wait since she is to be mine at last besides i am to be rich when i am thirty years old i am to be worth twenty thousand dollars i congratulate you wilbur said phil smiling you are all right at least the next gentleman said the attendant phil entered the inner room and looked about him in curiosity a tall woman sat upon a sort of throne with one hand resting on a table beside her a tall waxtaper supplied the place of the light of day which was studiously excluded from the room by thick dark curtains over the womans face was a black veil which gave her an air of mystery come hither boy she said in a clear commanding voice phil advanced not wholly unimpressed though he felt skeptical the woman bent forward starting slightly and scanned his face eagerly chapter xv phil and the fortuneteller do you wish to hear of the past or the future asked the fortuneteller tell me something of the past said phil with a view of testing the knowledge of the seeress you have left an uncongenial home to seek your fortune in new york you left without regret and those whom you have left behind do not miss you phil started in amazement this was certainly true shall i find the fortune i seek asked our hero earnestly yes but not in the way you expect you think yourself alone in the world the fortuneteller paused and looked searchingly at the boy so i am returned phil no boy who has a father living can consider himself alone my father is dead returned phil growing skeptical you are mistaken i am not likely to be mistaken in such a matter my father died a few months since your father still lives said the fortuneteller sharply do not contradict me i dont see how you can say that i attended his funeral you attended the funeral of the man whose name you bear he was not your father phil was much excited by this confirmation of his stepmothers story he had entertained serious doubts of its being true thinking it might have been trumped up by mrs brent to drive him from home and interfere with his succession to any part of mr brents property is my stepmothers story true then he asked breathlessly she told me i was not the son of mr brent her story was true said the veiled lady who is my real father then the lady did not immediately reply she seemed to be peering into distant space as she said slowly i see a man of middle size darkcomplexioned leading a small child by the hand he pauses before a house it looks like an inn a lady comes out from the inn she is kindly of aspect she takes the child by the hand and leads him into the inn now i see the man go away alone the little child remains behind i see him growing up he has become a large boy but the scene has changed the inn has disappeared i see a pleasant village and a comfortable house the boy stands at the door he is wellgrown now a lady stands on the threshold as his steps turn away she is thin and sharpfaced she is not like the lady who welcomed the little child can you tell me who this boy is asked the fortuneteller fixing her eyes upon phil it is myself he answers his flushed face showing the excitement he felt you have said i dont know how you have learned all this said phil but it is wonderfully exact will you answer a question ask you say my father my real father is living the veiled lady bowed her head where is he that i cannot say but he is looking for you he is in search of me yes why has he delayed it so long there are circumstances which i cannot explain which have prevented his seeking and claiming you will he do so i have told you that he is now seeking for you i think he will find you at last what can i do to bring this about do nothing stay where you are circumstances are working favorably but you must wait there are some drawbacks what are they you have two enemies or rather one for the other does not count is that enemy a man no it is a woman my stepmother ejaculated phil with immediate conviction you have guessed aright and who is the other a boy jonas it is the son of the woman whom you call your stepmother what harm can they do me i am not afraid of them said phil raising his head proudly do not be too confident the meanest are capable of harm mrs brent does not like you because she is a mother she fears that i will interfere with her son you are all right is there anything more you can tell me asked phil have i any other enemies yes there are two more also a woman and her son that puzzles me i can think of no one they live in the city i know it is mrs pitkin my employers wife why should she dislike me there is an old man who likes you that is the cause i see she doesnt want him to be kind to any one out of the family that is all i have to tell you said the fortuneteller abruptly you can go you have told me strange things said phil will you tell me how it is you know so much about a stranger i have nothing more to tell you you can go said the veiled lady impatiently at least tell me how much i am to pay you nothing but i thought you received fees not from you did you not take something from my friend who was in here before me yes you told him a good fortune he is a fool said the fortuneteller contemptuously i saw what he wanted and predicted it she waved her hand and phil felt that he had no excuse for remaining longer he left the room slowly and found mr wilbur anxiously awaiting him what did she tell you phil he asked eagerly did she tell you what sort of a wife you would have no i didnt ask her answered phil smiling i should think youd want to know what did she tell you then she told me quite a number of things about my past life and the events of my childhood i shouldnt have cared about that said wilbur shrugging his shoulders why i know all about that myself what i want to know about is whether i am to marry the girl i adore but you see wilbur i dont adore anybody i am not in love as you are of course that makes a difference said wilbur im glad i came phil aint you yes answered phil slowly you see its such a satisfaction to know that all is coming right at last i am to marry her you know and although it isnt till i am twentyfour she will be nearly thirty by that time said phil slyly she wont look it said mr wilbur wincing a little when i am thirty i shall be worth twenty thousand dollars you cant save it very soon out of six dollars a week that is true i feel sure i shall be raised soon did the fortuneteller say anything about your getting rich no i cant remember that she did oh yes she said i would make my fortune but not in the way i expected that is queer said mr wilbur interested what could she mean i suppose she meant that i would not save a competence out of five dollars a week maybe so i have been thinking wilbur you have an advantage over the young lady you are to marry you know that you are to marry her but she doesnt know who is to be her husband that is true said wilbur seriously if i can find out her name i will write her an anonymous letter asking her to call on the veiled lady chapter xvi mrs brents strange temptation now that phil is fairly established in the city circumstances require us to go back to the country town which he had once called home mrs brent is sitting engaged with her needle in the same room where she had made the important revelation to phil jonas entered the house stamping the snow from his boots is supper most ready mother he asked no jonas it is only four oclock replied mrs brent im as hungry as a bear i guess its the skating i wish you would go to the postoffice before supper jonas there might be a letter do you expect to hear from phil he said nothing about writing said mrs brent indifferently he will do as he pleases about it i didnt know but he would be writing for money chuckled jonas if he did i would send him some said mrs brent you would repeated jonas looking at his mother in surprise yes i would send him a dollar or two so that people neednt talk it is always best to avoid gossip are you expecting a letter from anybody mother asked jonas after a pause i dreamed last night i should receive an important letter said mrs brent with money in it asked jonas eagerly i dont know if any such letter comes will you give me some of the money if you bring me a letter containing money said mrs brent i will give you a dollar enough said exclaimed jonas who was fond of money im off to the postoffice at once mrs brent let the work fall into her lap and looked intently before her a flush appeared on her pale face and she showed signs of restlessness it is strange she said to herself how i have allowed myself to be affected by that dream i am not superstitious but i cannot get over the idea that a letter will reach me tonight and that it will have an important bearing upon my life i have a feeling too that it will relate to the boy philip she rose from her seat and began to move about the room it was a relief to her in the restless state of her mind she went to the window to look for jonas and her excitement rose as she saw him approaching when he saw his mother looking from the window he held aloft a letter the letter has come she said her heart beating faster than its wont it is an important letter how slow jonas is and she was inclined to be vexed at the deliberation with which her son was advancing toward the house but he came at last well mother ive got a letter a letter from philadelphia he said it isnt from phil for i know his writing give it to me jonas said his mother outwardly calm but inwardly excited do you know any one in philadelphia mother no she cut open the envelope and withdrew the inclosed sheet is there any money in it asked jonas eagerly no just my luck said jonas sullenly wait a minute said his mother if the letter is really important ill give you twentyfive cents she read the letter and her manner soon showed that she was deeply interested we will look over her shoulders and read it with her continental hotel philadelphia feb dear madam i write to you on a matter of the greatest importance to my happiness and shall most anxiously await your reply i would come to you in person but am laid up with an attack of rheumatism and my physician forbids me to travel you are as i have been informed the widow of gerald brent who thirteen years since kept a small hotel in the small village of fultonville in ohio at that date i one day registered myself as his guest i was not alone my only son then a boy of three accompanied me my wife was dead and my affections centered upon this child yet the next morning i left him under the charge of yourself and your husband and pursued my journey from that day to this i have not seen the boy nor have i written to you or mr brent this seems strange does it not it requires an explanation and that explanation i am ready to give to be brief then i was fleeing from undeserved suspicion circumstances which i need not detail had connected my name with the mysterious disappearance of a near friend and the fact that a trifling dispute between us had taken place in the presence of witnesses had strengthened their suspicions knowing myself to be innocent but unable to prove it i fled taking my child with me when i reached fultonville i became alive to the ease with which i might be traced through the childs companionship there was no resource but to leave him your husband and yourself impressed me as kind and warmhearted i was specially impressed by the gentleness with which you treated my little philip and i felt that to you i could safely trust him i did not however dare to confide my secret to any one i simply said i would leave the boy with you till he should recover from his temporary indisposition and then with outward calmness but inward anguish i left my darling knowing not if i should ever see him again well time passed i went to nevada changed my name invested the slender sum i had with me in mining and after varying fortune made a large fortune at last but better fortune still awaited me in a poor mining hut two months since i came across a man who confessed that he was guilty of the murder of which i had been suspected his confession was reduced in writing sworn to before a magistrate and now at last i feel myself a free man no one now could charge me with a crime from which my soul revolted when this matter was concluded my first thought was of the boy whom i had not seen for thirteen long years i could claim him now before all the world i could endow him with the gifts of fortune i could bring him up in luxury and i could satisfy a fathers affectionate longing i could not immediately ascertain where you were i wrote to fultonville to the postmaster and learned that you and mr brent had moved away and settled down in gresham in the state of new york i learned also that my philip was still living but other details i did not learn but i cared not so long as my boy still lived and now you may guess my wish and my intention i shall pay you handsomely for your kind care of philip but i must have my boy back again we have been separated too long i can well understand that you are attached to him and i will find a home for you and mr brent near my own where you can see as often as you like the boy whom you have so tenderly reared will you do me the favor to come at once and bring the boy with you the expenses of your journey shall of course be reimbursed and i will take care that the pecuniary part of my obligations to you shall be amply repaid i have already explained why i cannot come in person to claim my dear child telegraph to me when you will reach philadelphia and i will engage a room for you philip will stay with me yours gratefully oscar granville mother here is a slip of paper that has dropped from the letter said jonas he picked up and handed to his mother a check on a philadelphia bank for the sum of one hundred dollars why thats the same as money isnt it asked jonas yes jonas then youll keep your promise wont you mrs brent silently drew from her pocketbook a twodollar bill and handed it to jonas jonas she said if you wont breathe a word of it i will tell you a secret all right mother we start for philadelphia tomorrow by gosh thats jolly exclaimed jonas overjoyed ill keep mum what was in the letter mother i will not tell you just now you shall know very soon mrs brent did not sleep much that night her mind was intent upon a daring scheme of imposture mr granville was immensely wealthy no doubt why should she not pass off jonas upon him as his son philip and thus secure a fortune for her own child chapter xvii jonas joins the conspiracy later in the evening mrs brent took jonas into her confidence she was a silent secretive woman by nature and could her plan have been carried out without imparting it to any one she would gladly have had it so but jonas must be her active accomplice and it was as well to let him know at once what he must do in the evening when jonas tired with his days skating was lying on the lounge mrs brent rose deliberately from her seat peeped into the adjoining room then went to each window to make sure there was no eavesdropper then resumed her seat and said jonas get up i want to speak to you i am awfully tired mother i can hear you while i lie here jonas do you hear me i am about to speak to you of something no other person must hear get a chair and draw it close to mine jonas rose his curiosity stimulated by his mothers words and manner is it about the letter mother he asked yes it relates to the letter and our journey tomorrow jonas had wondered what the letter was about and who had sent his mother the hundreddollar check and he made no further objection he drew a chair in front of his mother and said go ahead mother im listening would you like to be rich jonas asked mrs brent wouldnt i would you like to be adopted by a very rich man have a pony to ride plenty of pocketmoney fine clothes and in the end a large fortune that would just suit me mother answered the boy eagerly is there any chance of it yes if you follow my directions implicitly i will mother said jonas his eyes shining with desire only tell me what to do and ill do it do you remember what i told philip the evening before he went away about his being left at mr brents hotel yes i remember it and about his true father having disappeared yes yes jonas the letter i received this afternoon was from philips real father by gosh ejaculated jonas altering his usual expression of surprise he is in philadelphia he is a very rich man then phil will be rich said jonas disappointed i thought you said it would be me philips father has never seen him since he was three years old continued mrs brent taking no notice of her sons tone what difference does that make mother jonas said mrs brent bending toward her son if i choose to tell him that you are philip he wont know the difference do you understand jonas did understand thats a bully idea mother can we pull the wool over the old mans eyes do you think i wish you would not use such expressions jonas they are not gentlemanly and you are to be a young gentleman all right mother we can manage it if you are very careful it is worth the trouble jonas i think mr granville that is his name must be worth a quarter of a million dollars and if he takes you for philip the whole will probably go to you what a head youve got mother exclaimed jonas admiringly it is a tiptop chance yes it is one chance in ten thousand but you must do just as i tell you oh ill do that mother what must i do to begin with you must take philips name you must remember that you are no longer jonas webb but philip brent thatll be a bully joke said jonas very much amused what would phil say if he knew i had taken his name he must not know henceforth we must endeavor to keep out of his way again you must consider me your stepmother not your own mother yes i understand what are you going to do first mother we start for philadelphia tomorrow your father is lying sick at the continental hotel jonas roared with delight at the manner in which his mother spoke of the sick stranger oh itll be fun mother shall we live in philadelphia i dont know that will be as mr granville thinks best where are you going mother are you going to live here of course i shall be with you i will make that a condition i cannot be parted from my only boy but i shall be mr granvilles boy to the public you will be but when we are together in private we shall be once more mother and son i am afraid you will spoil all said jonas old granville will suspect something if you seem to care too much for me the selfish nature of jonas was cropping out and his mother felt with a pang that he would be reconciled to part with her forever for the sake of the brilliant prospects and the large fortune which mr granville could offer him she was outwardly cold but such affection as she was capable of she expended on this graceless and ungrateful boy you seem to forget that i may have some feeling in the matter said mrs brent coldly but with inward pain if the result of this plan were to be that we should be permanently separated i would never consent to it just as you like mother said jonas with an ill grace i dont look much like phil no there will be a difficulty still mr granville has never seen philip since he was three years old and that is in our favor he thinks i am mr brents first wife shall you tell him i dont know i will be guided by circumstances perhaps it may be best i wouldnt like to have it discovered that i had deceived him in that how are you going to manage about this place mother i am going to write to your uncle jonas to take charge of it i will let him have it at a nominal rent then if our plan miscarries we shall have a place to come back to were you ever in philadelphia mother no but there will be no trouble in journeying there i shall pack your clothes and my own tonight of course jonas when you meet mr granville you must seem to be fond of him then you must tell him how kind i have been to you in fact you must act precisely as philip might be expected to do yes mother and you must be careful not to call me jonas that will spoil all you know rest assured that i shall be on my guard if you are as careful as i am philip jonas burst into a guffaw at the new name its just like playacting mother he said but it will pay better said mrs brent quietly i think it will be best for me to begin calling you philip at once that is as soon as we have left town so that we may both get accustomed to it all right mother youve got a good headpiece i will manage things properly if you consent to be guided by me all will be right oh ill do it mother i wish we were on our way you can go to bed if you like i must stay up late tonight i have to pack our trunks the next day the pair of adventurers left gresham from the earliest available point mrs brent telegraphed to mr granville that she was on her way with the son from whom he had so long been separated chapter xviii the conspiracy succeeds in a handsome private parlor at the continental hotel a man of about fortyfive years of age sat in an easychair he was of middle height rather dark complexion and a pleasant expression his right foot was bandaged and rested on a chair the morning daily ledger was in his hand but he was not reading his mind judging from his absorbed look was occupied with other thoughts i can hardly realize he said halfaloud that my boy will so soon be restored to my arms we have been separated by a cruel fate but we shall soon be together again i remember how the dear child looked when i left him at fultonville in the care of the kind innkeeper i am sorry he is dead but his widow shall be suitably repaid for her kind devotion he had reached this point when a knock was heard at the door come in said mr granville a servant of the hotel appeared a lady and a boy are in the parlor below sir they wish to see you though mr granville had considerable control over his feelings his heart beat fast when he heard these words will you show them up at once he said in a tone which showed some trace of agitation the servant bore the message to mrs brent and jonas who were sitting in the hotel parlor if mr granville was agitated the two conspirators were not wholly at their ease there was a red spot on each of mrs brents cheeks her way of expressing emotion and jonas was fidgeting about uneasily in his chair staring about him curiously mind what i told you said his mother in a low voice remember to act like a boy who has suddenly been restored to his longlost father everything depends on first impressions i wish it was all over i wish i was out of it said jonas wiping the perspiration from his face suppose he suspects he wont if you do as i tell you dont look gawky but act naturally just then the servant reappeared you are to come upstairs he said the gentleman will see you thank you said mrs brent rising come jonas rose and with the manner of a cur that expected a whipping followed his mother and the servant its only one flight said the servant but we can take the elevator it is of no consequence mrs brent began but jonas said eagerly lets ride on the elevator ma very well philip said mrs brent a minute later the two stood at the door of mr granvilles room next they stood in his presence mr granville looking eagerly toward the door passed over mrs brent and his glance rested on the boy who followed her he started and there was a quick feeling of disappointment he had been picturing to himself how his lost boy would look but none of his visions resembled the awkwardlooking boy who stood sheepishly by the side of mrs brent mr granville i presume said the lady yes madam you are mrs brent and this pointing to jonas is the boy you left at fultonville thirteen years ago philip go to your father jonas advanced awkwardly to mr granvilles chair and said in parrotlike tones im so glad to see you pa and you are really philip said mr granville slowly yes im philip brent but i suppose my name is granville now come here my boy mr granville drew the boy to him and looked earnestly in his face then kissed him affectionately he has changed since he was a little child mrs brent he said with a halfsigh thats to be expected sir he was only three years old when you left him with us but it seems to me that his hair and complexion are lighter you can judge of that better than i said mrs brent plausibly to me who have seen him daily the change was not perceptible i am greatly indebted to you for your devoted care to you and your husband i am grieved to hear that mr brent is dead yes sir he left me six months since it was a grievous loss ah sir when i give up philip also i shall feel quite alone in the world and she pressed a handkerchief to her eyes you see i have come to look upon him as my own boy my dear madam dont think that i shall be so cruel as to take him from you though i wish him now to live with me you must accompany him my home shall be yours if you are willing to accept a room in my house and a seat at my table oh mr granville how can i thank you for your great kindness ever since i received your letter i have been depressed with the thought that i should lose dear philip if i had a child of my own it would be different but having none my affections are centered upon him and very naturally said mr granville we become attached to those whom we benefit doubtless he feels a like affection for you you love this good lady philip who has supplied to you the place of your own mother who died in your infancy do you not yes sir answered jonas stolidly but i want to live with my pa to be sure you shall my boy we have been separated too long already henceforth we will live together and mrs brent shall live with us where do you live pa asked jonas i have a countryseat a few miles from chicago answered mr granville we will go there as soon as i am well enough i ought to apologize mrs brent for inviting you up to my room but my rheumatism makes me a prisoner i hope your rheumatism will soon leave you sir i think it will i have an excellent physician and already i am much better i may however have to remain here a few days yet and where do you wish philip and i to remain in the meantime here of course philip will you ring the bell i dont see any bell answered jonas bewildered touch that knob jonas did so will that ring the bell he asked curiously yes it is an electric bell by gosh ejaculated jonas dont use such language philip said mrs brent hastily your father will be shocked you see mr granville philip has associated with country boys and in spite of my care he has adopted some of their language mr granville himself was rather disturbed by this countrified utterance and it occurred to him that his newfound son needed considerable polishing ah i quite understand that mrs brent he said courteously he is young yet and there will be plenty of time for him to get rid of any objectionable habits and phrases here the servant appeared tell the clerk to assign this lady and the boy rooms on this floor if any are vacant mrs brent philip may have a room next to you for the present when i am better i will have him with me john is dinner on the table yes sir then after taking possession of your rooms you and philip had better go to dinner i will send for him later thank you sir as mrs brent was ushered into her handsome apartment her face was radiant with joy and exultation all has gone well she said the most difficult part is over chapter xix a narrow escape from detection the conspiracy into which mrs brent had entered was a daring one and required great coolness and audacity but the inducements were great and for her sons sake she decided to carry it through of course it was necessary that she should not be identified with any one who could disclose to mr granville the deceit that was being practiced upon him circumstances lessened the risk of detection since mr granville was confined to his room in the hotel and for a week she and jonas went about the city alone one day she had a scare she was occupying a seat in a chestnut street car while jonas stood in front with the driver when a gentleman whom she had not observed sitting at the other end of the car espied her why mrs brent how came you here he asked in surprise crossing over and taking a seat beside her her color went and came as in a subdued tone she answered i am in philadelphia on a little visit mr pearson are you not rather out of your latitude asked the gentleman yes perhaps so how is mr brent did you not hear that he was dead no indeed i sympathize with you in your sad loss yes sighed the widow it is a great loss to us i suppose jonas is a large boy now said the other i havent seen him for two or three years yes he has grown said the widow briefly she hoped that mr pearson would not discover that jonas was with her as she feared that the boy might betray them unconsciously is he with you yes do you stay long in philadelphia no i think not answered mrs brent i go back to new york this afternoon or i would ask permission to call on you mrs brent breathed more freely a call at the hotel was by all means to be avoided of course i should have been glad to see you she answered feeling quite safe in saying so are you going far i get out at thirteenth street thank heaven said mrs brent to herself then he wont discover where we are the continental hotel is situated at the corner of chestnut and ninth streets and mrs brent feared that jonas would stop the car at that point as it was the boy did not observe that his mother had met an acquaintance so intent was he on watching the street sights when they reached ninth street mother and son got out and entered the hotel i guess ill stay down stairs awhile said jonas no philip i have something to say to you come up with me i want to go into the billiardroom said jonas grumbling it is very important said mrs brent emphatically now the curiosity of jonas was excited and he followed his mother into the elevator for their rooms were on the third floor well mother what is it asked jonas when the door of his mothers room was closed behind them i met a gentleman who knew me in the horsecar said mrs brent abruptly did you who was it mr pearson he used to give me candy why didnt you call me it is important that we should not be recognized said his mother while we stay here we must be exceedingly prudent suppose he had called upon us at the hotel and fallen in with mr granville he might have told him that you are my son and that your name is jonas not philip then the fat would be in the fire said jonas exactly so i am glad you see the danger now i want you to stay here or in your own room for the next two or three hours itll be awfully tiresome grumbled jonas it is necessary said his mother firmly mr pearson leaves for new york by an afternoon train it is now only two oclock he left the car at thirteenth street and might easily call at this hotel it is a general rendezvous for visitors to the city if he should meet you down stairs he would probably know you and his curiosity would be aroused he asked me where i was staying but i didnt appear to hear the question thats pretty hard on me ma i am out of all patience with you said mrs brent am i not working for your interest and you are doing all you can to thwart my plans if you dont care anything about inheriting a large fortune let it go we can go back to gresham and give it all up ill do as you say ma said jonas subdued the very next day mr granville sent for mrs brent she lost no time in waiting upon him mrs brent he said i have decided to leave philadelphia tomorrow are you quite able sir she asked with a good assumption of sympathy my doctor tells me i may venture we shall travel in pullman cars you know i shall secure a whole compartment and avail myself of every comfort and luxury which money can command ah sir money is a good friend in such a case true mrs brent i have seen the time when i was poorly supplied with it now i am happily at ease can you and philip be ready yes mr granville answered mrs brent promptly we are ready today for that matter we shall both be glad to get started i am glad to hear it i think philip will like his western home i bought a fine country estate of a chicago merchant whose failure compelled him to part with it philip shall have his own horse and his own servants he will be delighted said mrs brent warmly he has been used to none of these things for mr brent and i much as we loved him had not the means to provide him with such luxuries yes mrs brent i understand that fully you were far from rich yet you cared for my boy as if he were your own i loved him as much as if he had been my own son mr granville i am sure you did i thank providence that i am able to repay to some extent the great debt i have incurred i cannot repay it wholly but i will take care that you too shall enjoy ease and luxury you shall have one of the best rooms in my house and a special servant to wait upon you thank you mr granville said mrs brent her heart filled with proud anticipations of the state in which she should hereafter live i do not care where you put me so long as you do not separate me from philip she certainly loves my son said mr granville to himself yet her ordinary manner is cold and constrained and she does not seem like a woman whose affections would easily be taken captive yet philip seems to have found the way to her heart it must be because she has had so much care of him we are apt to love those whom we benefit but though mr granville credited mrs brent with an affection for philip he was uneasily conscious that the boys return had not brought him the satisfaction and happiness he had fondly anticipated to begin with philip did not look at all as he had supposed his son would look he did not look like the granvilles at all indeed he had an unusually countrified aspect and his conversation was mingled with rustic phrases which shocked his fathers taste i suppose it comes of the way in which he has been brought up and the country boys he has associated with thought mr granville fortunately he is young and there is time to polish him as soon as i reach chicago i will engage a private tutor for him who shall not only remedy his defects of education but do what he can to improve my sons manners i want him to grow up a gentleman the next day the three started for chicago while mr granvilles real son and heir continued to live at a cheap lodginghouse in new york the star of jonas was in the ascendant while poor philip seemed destined to years of poverty and hard work even now he was threatened by serious misfortune chapter xx left out in the cold of course phil was utterly ignorant of the audacious attempt to deprive him of his rights and keep him apart from the father who longed once more to meet him there was nothing before him so far as he knew except to continue the uphill struggle for a living he gave very little thought to the prediction of the fortuneteller whom he had consulted and didnt dream of any shortcut to fortune do all he could he found he could not live on his wages his board cost him four dollars a week and washing and lunch two dollars more thus compelling him to exceed his salary by a dollar each week he had as we know a reserve fund on which he could draw but it was small and grew constantly smaller then again his clothes were wearing out and he saw no way of obtaining money to buy new phil became uneasy and the question came up to his mind should he write to his stepmother and ask her for a trifling loan if the money had been hers he would not have done so on any condition but she had had nothing of her own and all the property in her hands came through mr brent who as he knew was attached to him even though no tie of blood united them he certainly meant that phil should be cared for out of the estate and at length phil brought himself to write the following letter new york march dear mrs brent i suppose i ought to have written you before and have no good excuse to offer i hope you and jonas are well and will continue so let me tell you how i have succeeded thus far i have been fortunate enough to obtain a place in a large mercantile establishment and for my services i am paid five dollars a week this is more than boys generally get in the first place and i am indebted to the partiality of an old gentleman the senior member of the firm whom i had the chance to oblige for faring so well still i find it hard to get along on this sum though i am as economical as possible my board and washing cost me six dollars a week and i have besides to buy clothing from time to time i have nearly spent the extra money i had with me and do not know how to keep myself looking respectable in the way of clothing under the circumstances i shall have to apply to you for a loan say of twentyfive dollars in a year or two i hope to earn enough to be entirely independent at present i cannot expect it as my father mr brent undoubtedly intended to provide for me i dont think i need to apologize for making this request still i do it reluctantly for i would prefer to depend entirely upon myself with regards to you and jonas i am yours truly philip brent phil put this letter in the postoffice and patiently waited for an answer mrs brent surely cannot refuse me he said to himself since i have almost wholly relieved her of the expense of taking care of me phil felt so sure that money would be sent to him that he began to look round a little among readymade clothing stores to see at what price he could obtain a suit that would do for everyday use he found a store in the bowery where he could secure a suit which looked as if it would answer for thirteen dollars if mrs brent sent him twentyfive that would leave him twelve for underclothing and for a reserve fund to meet the weekly deficit which he could not avoid three four days passed and no letter came in answer to his it cant be that mrs brent wont at least answer my letter he thought uneasily even if she didnt send me twentyfive dollars she couldnt help sending me something still he felt uneasy in view of the position in which he would find himself in case no letter or remittance should come at all it was during this period of anxiety that his heart leaped for joy when on broadway he saw the familiar form of reuben gordon a young man already mentioned to whom phil had sold his gun before leaving gresham why reuben how are you exclaimed phil joyfully when did you come to town phil brent exclaimed reuben shaking hands heartily im thunderin glad to see you i was thinkin of you only five minutes ago and wonderin where you hung out but you havent told me when you came to new york only this morning im goin to stay with a cousin of my fathers that lives in brooklyn over night i wanted to ask you about mrs brent and jonas i was afraid they might be sick for i wrote four days ago and havent got any answer yet where did you write to to gresham of course answered phil in surprise you dont mean to say you haint heard of their leavin gresham said reuben in evident astonishment who has left gresham your mother leastwise mrs brent and jonas they cleared out three weeks ago and nobodys heard a word of them since that is nobody in the village dont you know where theyve gone asked phil in amazement no i was goin to ask you i sposed of course theyd write and let you know i didnt even know they had left gresham well thats what i call curus it aint treatin you right accordin to my ideas is the house shut up it was till two days ago then a brother of mrs brent came and opened it he has brought his wife and one child with him and it seems theyre goin to live there somebody asked him where his sister and jonas were but they didnt get no satisfaction he said he didnt rightly know himself he believed they was travelin thought they might be in canada phil looked and felt decidedly sober at this information he understood of course now why his letter had not been answered it looked as if he were an outcast from the home that had been his so long when he came to new york to earn a living he felt that he was doing so voluntarily and was not obliged to do so now he was absolutely thrown upon his own resources and must either work or starve theyve treated you real mean said reuben i never did like mrs brent or jonas either for that matter where are you working phil answered this question and several others which his honest country friend asked but his mind was preoccupied and he answered some of the questions at random finally he excused himself on the ground that he must be getting back to the store that evening phil thought seriously of his position something must be done that was very evident his expenses exceeded his income and he needed some clothing there was no chance of getting his wages raised under a year for he already received more pay than it was customary to give to a boy what should he do phil decided to lay his position frankly before the only friend he had in the city likely to help him mr oliver carter the old gentleman had been so friendly and kind that he felt that he would not at any rate repulse him after he had come to this decision he felt better he determined to lose no time in calling upon mr carter after supper he brushed his hair carefully and made himself look as well as circumstances would admit then he bent his steps toward twelfth street where as the reader will remember mr carter lived with his niece he ascended the steps and rang the bell it was opened by hannah who recognized him having admitted him on the former occasion of his calling goodevening said phil pleasantly is mr carter at home no sir answered hannah didnt you know he had gone to florida gone to florida repeated phil his heart sinking when did he start he started this afternoon whos asking after uncle oliver asked a boys voice looking behind hannah phil recognized the speaker as alonzo pitkin chapter xxi they met by chance who was asking after uncle oliver demanded alonzo superciliously i was answered philip oh its you is it said alonzo rather disdainfully yes answered phil calmly though he felt provoked at alonzos tone which was meant to be offensive you remember me dont you you are the boy that got round uncle oliver and got him to give you a place in pas store i deny that i got round him returned phil warmly i had the good luck to do him a favor i suppose you have come after money said alonzo coarsely i shant ask you for any at any rate said phil angrily no it wouldnt do any good said alonzo and its no use asking ma either she says you are an adventurer and have designs on uncle oliver because he is rich i shall not ask your mother for any favor said phil provoked i am sorry not to meet your uncle i dare say sneered alonzo just then a woman poorly but neatly dressed came down stairs her face was troubled just behind her came mrs pitkin whose face wore a chilly and proud look mr carter has left the city and i really dont know when he will return phil heard her say if he had been at home it would not have benefited you he is violently prejudiced against you and would not have listened to a word you had to say i did not think he would have harbored resentment so long murmured the poor woman he never seemed to me to be a hard man phil gazed at the poorly dressed woman with a surprise which he did not attempt to conceal for in her he recognized the familiar figure of his landlady what could she have to do in this house he asked himself mrs forbush he exclaimed philip exclaimed mrs forbush in a surprise as great as his own for she had never asked where her young lodger worked and was not aware that he was in the employ of her cousins husband and well acquainted with the rich uncle whom she had not seen for years do you know each other demanded mrs pitkin whose turn it was to be surprised this young gentleman lodges in my house answered mrs forbush young gentleman repeated alonzo with a mocking laugh philip looked at him sternly he had his share of human nature and it would have given him satisfaction to thrash the insolent young patrician as alonzo chose to consider himself and what do you want here young man asked mrs pitkin in a frosty tone addressing phil of course i wished to see mr carter answered phil really mr carter seems to be very much in request sneered mrs pitkin no doubt he will be very much disappointed when he hears what he has lost you will have to go to florida to see him i think however she added after a pause it will not be well for either of you to call again mr carter will understand the motive of your calls how cruel you are lavinia said mrs forbush sadly my name is mrs pitkin said that lady frigidly you have not forgotten that we are cousins surely i do not care to remember it mrs forbush goodday there was no alternative but for mrs forbush to say goodday also and to descend the steps philip joined her in the street are you really the cousin of mrs pitkin he asked yes answered mrs forbush i bear the same relationship to mr carter that she does we were much together as girls and were both educated at the same expensive schools i offended my relatives by marrying mr forbush whose fault was that he was poor and chiefly i think through the efforts of lavinia pitkin i was cast out by the family but where did you meet uncle oliver philip explained the circumstances already known to the reader mr carter seems to me to be a kindhearted man he said i dont believe he would have cast you off if he had not been influenced by other parties so i think said mrs forbush i will tell you she continued after a pause what drew me here this afternoon i am struggling hard to keep my head above water mr brent but i find it hard to meet my expenses i cannot meet my rent due tomorrow within fifteen dollars and i dared to hope that if i could meet uncle oliver face to face and explain matters to him he would let me have the money i am sure he would said phil warmly but he is in florida and will probably remain there for a month or two at least said mrs forbush sighing but even if he were in the city i suppose lavinia would do all in her power to keep us apart i have no doubt she would mrs forbush though she is your cousin i dislike her very much i suppose the boy with whom you were talking was her son alonzo yes he is about the most disagreeable boy i ever met both he and his mother seem very much opposed to my having an interview with your uncle lavinia was always of a jealous and suspicious disposition said mrs forbush i have not seen alonzo since he was a baby he is two years older than my julia he was born before i estranged my relatives by marrying a poor man what are you going to do mrs forbush about the rent asked phil in a tone of sympathy i dont know i shall try to get the landlord to wait but i dont know how he will feel about it i wish i had plenty of money i would gladly lend you all you need i am sure you would philip said mrs forbush the offer does me good though it is not accompanied by the ability to do what your good heart dictates i feel that i am not without friends i am a very poor one said phil the fact is i am in trouble myself my income is only five dollars a week and my expenses are beyond that i dont know how i am going to keep up you may stay with me for three dollars a week if you cannot pay four said mrs forbush forgetting her own troubles in her sympathy with our hero no mrs forbush you cant afford it you need money as much as i do and perhaps more for you have more than yourself to support yes poor julia sighed the mother she is born to a heritage of poverty heaven only knows how we are going to get along god will provide for us mrs forbush said philip i dont know how it is but in spite of my troubles i feel cheerful i have a confidence that things will come out well though i cannot possibly imagine how you are young and youth is more inclined to be hopeful than maturer years however i do not wish to dampen your cheerfulness keep it and let it comfort you if phil could have heard the conversation that took place between mrs pitkin and alonzo after their departure he might have felt less hopeful it is dreadfully annoying that that woman should turn up after all these years said mrs pitkin in a tone of disgust is she really your cousin ma asked alonzo yes but she disgraced herself by a low marriage and was cast off that disposes of her then i dont know if she could meet uncle oliver i am afraid she would worm herself into his confidence and get him to do something for her then it is unfortunate that she and that boy have fallen in with each other she may get him to speak to uncle oliver in her behalf isnt he working for pa yes why dont you get pa to discharge him while uncle oliver is away well thought of alonzo i will speak to your father this very evening chapter xxii phil is bounced saturday as is usual in such establishments was payday at the store of phils employers the weeks wages were put up in small envelopes and handed to the various clerks when phil went up to the cashier to get his money he put it quietly into his vestpocket daniel dickson the cashier observing this said brent you had better open your envelope rather surprised phil nevertheless did as requested in the envelope besides the fivedollar bill representing his weeks salary he found a small slip of paper on which was written these ominous words your services will not be required after this week appended to this notice was the name of the firm phil turned pale for to him embarrassed as he was the loss of his place was a very serious matter what does this mean mr dickson he asked quickly i cant inform you answered the cashier smiling unpleasantly for he was a selfish man who sympathized with no one and cared for no one as long as he himself remained prosperous who handed you this paper asked phil the boss mr pitkin of course mr pitkin was still in his little office and phil made his way directly to him may i speak to you sir asked our hero be quick about it then for i am in a hurry answered pitkin in a very forbidding tone why am i discharged sir i cant go into details we dont need you any longer are you not satisfied with me no said pitkin brusquely in what respect have i failed to satisfy you sir dont put on any airs boy returned pitkin we dont want you thats all you might have given me a little notice said phil indignantly we made no stipulation of that kind i believe it would only be fair sir no impertinence young man i wont stand it i dont need any instructions as to the manner of conducting my business phil by this time perceived that his discharge was decided upon without any reference to the way in which he had performed his duties and that any discussion or remonstrance would be unavailing i see sir that you have no regard for justice and will leave you he said youd better and without delay said pitkin irascibly phil emerged upon the street with a sinking heart his available funds consisted only of the money he had just received and seventyfive cents in change and what he was to do he did not know he walked home with slow steps looking sad in spite of his usually hopeful temperament when he entered the house he met mrs forbush in the hall she at once noticed his gravity have you had any bad luck philip she asked yes answered phil i have lost my situation indeed returned the landlady with quick sympathy have you had any difficulty with your employer not that i am aware of did he assign any reason for your discharge no i asked him for an explanation but he merely said i was not wanted any longer isnt there any chance of his taking you back i am sure there is not dont be discouraged philip a smart boy like you wont be long out of a place meanwhile you are welcome to stay here as long as i have a roof to cover me thank you mrs forbush said phil warmly you are a true friend you are in trouble yourself yet you stand by me i have had a stroke of good luck today said mrs forbush cheerfully a former boarder whom i allowed to remain here for five or six weeks when he was out of employment has sent me thirty dollars in payment of his bill from boston where he found a position so i shall be able to pay my rent and have something over i have been lucky and so may you phil was cheered by the ready sympathy of his landlady and began to take a more cheerful view of matters i will go out bright and early on monday and see if i cant find another place he said perhaps it may be all for the best yet on the day succeeding he had some sober hours how differently he had been situated only three months before then he had a home and relatives now he was practically alone in the world with no home in which he could claim a share and he did not even know where his stepmother and jonas were sunday forenoon he attended church and while he sat within its sacred precincts his mind was tranquilized and his faith and cheerfulness increased on monday he bought the herald and made a tour of inquiry wherever he saw that a boy was wanted but in each place he was asked if he could produce a recommendation from his last employer he decided to go back to his old place and ask for one though he was very reluctant to ask a favor of any kind from a man who had treated him so shabbily as mr pitkin it seemed necessary however and he crushed down his pride and made his way to mr pitkins private office mr pitkin he said you here exclaimed pitkin scowling you neednt ask to be taken back its no use i dont ask it answered phil then what are you here for i would like a letter of recommendation that i may obtain another place well well said pitkin wagging his head if that isnt impudence what is impudence asked phil i did as well as i could and that i am ready to do for another employer but all ask me for a letter from you you wont get any said pitkin abruptly where is your home i have none except in this city where did you come from from the country then i advise you to go back there you may do for the country you are out of place in the city poor phil things did indeed look dark for him without a letter of recommendation from mr pitkin it would be almost impossible for him to secure another place and how could he maintain himself in the city he didnt wish to sell papers or black boots and those were about the only paths now open to him i am having a rough time he thought but i will try not to get discouraged he turned upon his heel and walked out of the store as he passed the counter where wilbur was standing the young man said i am awfully sorry philip its a shame if i wasnt broke id offer to lend you a fiver thank you all the same for your kind offer wilbur said phil come round and see me so i will soon he left the store and wandered aimlessly about the streets four days later sick with hope deferred he made his way down to the wharf of the charleston and savannah boats with a vague idea that he might get a job of carrying baggage for he felt that he must not let his pride interfere with doing anything by which he could earn an honest penny it so happened that the charleston boat was just in and the passengers were just landing phil stood on the pier and gazed listlessly at them as they disembarked all at once he started in surprise and his heart beat joyfully there just descending the gangplank was his tried friend mr oliver carter whom he supposed over a thousand miles away in florida mr carter exclaimed phil dashing forward philip exclaimed the old gentleman much surprised how came you here did mr pitkin send you chapter xxiii an explanation it would be hard to tell which of the two was the more surprised at the meeting philip or mr carter i dont understand how mr pitkin came to hear of my return i didnt telegraph said the old gentleman i dont think he knows anything about it said phil didnt he send you to the pier no sir then how is it that you are not in the store at this time asked mr carter puzzled because i am no longer in mr pitkins employ i was discharged last saturday discharged what for mr pitkin gave no reason he said my services were no longer required he spoke roughly to me and has since declined to give me a recommendation though i told him that without it i should be unable to secure employment elsewhere mr carter frowned he was evidently annoyed and indignant this must be inquired into he said philip call a carriage and i will at once go to the astor house and take a room i had intended to go at once to mr pitkins but i shall not do so until i have had an explanation of this outrageous piece of business phil was rejoiced to hear this for he was at the end of his resources and the outlook for him was decidedly gloomy he had about made up his mind to sink his pride and go into business as a newsboy the next day but the very unexpected arrival of mr carter put quite a new face on matters he called a carriage and both he and mr carter entered it how do you happen to be back so soon sir asked phil when they were seated i thought you were going to florida for a couple of months i started with that intention but on reaching charleston i changed my mind i expected to find some friends at st augustine but i learned that they were already returning to the north and i felt that i should be lonely and decided to return i am very glad i did now did you receive my letter your letter queried philip looking at mr carter in surprise certainly i gave alonzo a letter for you which i had directed to your boardinghouse and requested him to mail it it contained a tendollar bill i never received any such letter sir it would have been of great service to me the money i mean for i have found it hard to live on five dollars a week now i have not even that is it possible that alonzo could have suppressed the letter said mr carter to himself at any rate i never received it here is something else to inquire into said mr carter if alonzo has tampered with my letter perhaps appropriated the money it will be the worse for him i hardly think he would do that sir though i dont like him you are generous but i know the boy better than you do he is fond of money not for the sake of spending it but for the sake of hoarding it tell me then how did you learn that i had gone to florida i learned it at the house in twelfth street then you called there yes sir i called to see you i found it hard to get along on my salary and i did not want mrs forbush to lose by me so i mrs forbush repeated the old gentleman quickly that name sounds familiar to me mrs forbush is your niece said phil a hope rising in his heart that he might be able to do his kind landlady a good turn did she tell you that no sir that is i was ignorant of it until i met her just as i was going away from mrs pitkins did she call there too to see me asked the old gentleman yes sir but she got a very cold reception mrs pitkin was very rude to her and said that you were so much prejudiced against her that she had better not call again thats like her cold selfishness i understand her motives very well i had no idea that mrs forbush was in the city is she poor yes sir she is having a hard struggle to maintain herself and her daughter and you board at her house yes sir how strangely things come about she is as nearly related to me as lavinia mrs pitkin she told me so she married against the wishes of her family but i can see now that we were all unreasonably prejudiced against her lavinia however trumped up stories against her husband which i am now led to believe were quite destitute of foundation and did all she could to keep alive the feud i feel now that i was very foolish to lend myself to her selfish ends of course her object was to get my whole fortune for herself and her boy phil had no doubt of this but he did not like to say so for it would seem that he too was influenced by selfish motives then you are not so much prejudiced against mrs forbush as she was told he allowed himself to say no no said mr carter earnestly poor rebecca she has a much better nature and disposition than mrs pitkin and you say she is poor she had great difficulty in paying her last months rent said philip where does she live phil told him what sort of a house is it it isnt a brownstone front answered phil smiling it is a poor cheap house but it is as good as she can afford to hire and you like her very much mr carter she has been very kind to me and though she finds it so hard to get along she has told me she will keep me as long as she has a roof over her head though just now i cannot pay my board because my income is gone it will come back again philip said the old gentleman phil understood by this that he would be restored to his place in mr pitkins establishment this did not yield him unalloyed satisfaction for he was sure that it would be made unpleasant for him by mr pitkin still he would accept it and meet disagreeable things as well as he could by this time they had reached the astor house phil jumped out first and assisted mr carter to descend he took mr carters handbag and followed him into the hotel mr carter entered his name in the register what is your name he asked philip brent yes sir i will enter your name too am i to stay here asked phil in surprise yes i shall need a confidential clerk and for the present you will fill that position i will take two adjoining rooms one for you phil listened in surprise thank you sir he said mr carter gave orders to have his trunk sent for from the steamer and took possession of the room philips room was smaller but considerably more luxurious than the one he occupied at the house of mrs forbush have you any money philip asked the old gentleman i have twentyfive cents answered philip that isnt a very large sum said mr carter smiling here let me replenish your pocketbook he drew four fivedollar bills from his wallet and handed them to phil how can i thank you sir asked phil gratefully wait till you have more to thank me for let me tell you this that in trying to harm you mr and mrs pitkin have done you a great service i should like to see mrs forbush this evening if you can spare me to let her know that she neednt be anxious about me by all means you can go am i at liberty to mention that i have seen you sir yes tell her that i will call tomorrow and you may take her this mr carter drew a hundreddollar bill from his wallet and passed it to phil get it changed at the office as you go out he said come back as soon as you can with a joyful heart phil jumped on a fourth avenue car in front of the hotel and started on his way up town chapter xxiv raising the rent leaving phil we will precede him to the house of mrs forbush she had managed to pay the rent due but she was not out of trouble the time had come when it was necessary to decide whether she would retain the house for the following year in new york as many of my young readers may know the first of may is movingday and leases generally begin at that date engagements are made generally by or before march st mr stone the landlord called upon the widow to ascertain whether she proposed to remain in the house i suppose i may as well do so said mrs forbush she had had difficulty in making her monthly payments but to move would involve expense and it might be some time before she could secure boarders in a new location you cant do better said the landlord at fifty dollars a month this is a very cheap house you mean fortyfive mr stone said mrs forbush no i dont said the landlord but that is what i have been paying this last year that is true but i ought to get fifty dollars and if you wont pay it somebody else will mr stone said the widow in a troubled voice i hope you will be considerate it has been as much as i could do to get together fortyfive dollars each month to pay you indeed i can pay no more pardon me for saying that that is no affair of mine said the landlord brusquely if you cant pay the rent by all means move into a smaller house if you stay here you must be prepared to pay fifty dollars a month i dont see how i can answered the widow in dejection ill give you three days to consider it said the landlord indifferently youll make a mistake if you give the house up however that is your affair the landlord left the house and mrs forbush sat down depressed julia she said to her daughter i wish you were old enough to advise me i dislike to move but i dont dare to engage to pay such a rent fifty dollars a month will amount to six hundred dollars a year said julia who was good at figures and that seems a great sum to us it would be little enough to mrs pitkin said julia who felt that ladys prosperity unjust while her poor patient mother had to struggle so hard for a scanty livelihood oh yes lavinia is rolling in wealth sighed mrs forbush i cant understand how uncle oliver can bestow his favors on so selfish a woman why dont you ask philips advice about keeping the house said julia it must be explained that philip and julia were already excellent friends and it may be said that each was mutually attracted by the other poor philip has his own troubles said mrs forbush he has lost his place through the malice and jealousy of mr and mrs pitkin for i am sure that lavinia is the cause of his dismissal and i dont know when he will be able to get another you wont send him away mother if he cant pay his board no answered her mother warmly philip is welcome to stay with us as long as we have a roof over our heads whether he can pay his board or not this answer seemed very satisfactory to julia who rose impulsively and kissed her mother thats a good mother she said it would be a pity to send poor philip into the street you seem to like philip said mrs forbush smiling faintly yes mother you know i havent any brother and phil seems just like a brother to me just then the door opened and philip himself entered the room generally he came home looking depressed after a long and ineffectual search for employment now he was fairly radiant with joy phil youve got a place i know you have exclaimed julia noticing his glad expression where is it is it a good one have you really got a place philip asked mrs forbush yes for the present do you think you shall like your employer he is certainly treating me very well said phil smiling he has paid me twenty dollars in advance then the age of wonders has not passed said the widow of course i believe you philip but it seems extraordinary there is something more extraordinary to come said phil he has sent you some money too me exclaimed mrs forbush in great surprise what can he know about me i told him about you but we are strangers he used to know you and still feels an interest in you mrs forbush who can it be said the widow looking bewildered i dont want to keep you in suspense any longer so i may as well say that it is your uncle oliver uncle oliver why he is in florida no he came home from charleston i happened to be at the pier i went down to see if i could get a job at smashing baggage when i saw him walking down the gangplank has he gone to his old quarters at mr pitkins no what i told about the way they treated you and me made him angry and he drove to the astor house i have a room there too and am to act as his private secretary so that is your new situation phil said julia yes and it is a good one and he really feels kindly to me said mrs forbush hopefully he sends you this and will call tomorrow said phil actions speak louder than words there are a hundred dollars in this roll of bills he sent all this to me she said yes and of his own accord it was no suggestion of mine julia said mrs forbush turning to her daughter i believe god has heard my prayer and that better days are in store for all of us philip included added phil smiling yes i want you to share in our good fortune mother you had better consult phil about keeping the house oh yes mrs forbush thereupon told philip of the landlords visit and his proposal to ask a higher rent i hesitated about taking the house she said but with this handsome gift from uncle oliver i dont know but i may venture what do you think i think mrs forbush you had better not decide till you have seen your uncle he may have some plan of his own for you at any rate you had better consult him he will call tomorrow and now let me pay you for my weeks board no philip i shall not want it with all this money which i should not have received but for you a debt is a debt mrs forbush and i prefer to pay it i shall not be here to supper as mr carter is expecting me back to the astor house i shall probably come with him when he calls upon you tomorrow on his return to the hotel as he was walking on broadway phil came face to face with alonzo pitkin i think ill ask him about that letter his uncle gave him to post to me thought phil and he waited until alonzo was close at hand chapter xxv alonzo is puzzled alonzo who had his share of curiosity as soon as he saw phils approach determined to speak to him and ascertain what were his plans and what he was doing with the petty malice which he inherited from his mother he hoped that phil had been unable to find a place and was in distress it would serve him right said alonzo to himself for trying to get into uncle olivers good graces i spose he would like to cut me out but hell find that he cant fight against ma and me oh its you is it was alonzos salutation when they met yes answered phil pa bounced you didnt he continued alonzo complacently yes answered phil that is he discharged me i suppose that is what you meant youve got it right the first time said alonzo have you got another place do you ask because you feel interested in me asked phil well not particularly answered alonzo appearing quite amused by the suggestion then you ask out of curiosity spose i do i dont mind telling you that i have found a place then what sort of a place asked alonzo disappointed there is no need of going into particulars no i spose not sneered alonzo youre probably selling papers or blacking boots you are mistaken i have a much better situation than i had with your father alonzos lower jaw fell he was very sorry to hear it didnt your employer ask for a recommendation he didnt seem to think one necessary replied phil if hed known pa had sacked you he wouldnt have wanted you i guess he knows it have you got through asking questions alonzo you are too familiar you can call me mr pitkin phil laughed at alonzos assumption of dignity but made no comment upon it i want to ask you what you did with that letter mr carter gave you to post for me asked phil alonzo was indeed surprised not to say dismayed the truth was that judging from the feel of the letter it contained money and he had opened it and appropriated the money to his own use moreover he had the banknote in his pocket at that very moment not having any wish to spend but rather to hoard it thats a queer question he stammered what letter do you refer to a letter mr carter gave you to mail to me if he gave me any such letter i mailed it answered alonzo scarcely knowing what to say i didnt receive it how do you know he gave me any letter demanded alonzo puzzled i dont care to tell i only know that there was such a letter handed to you do you know what was in it writing i spose said alonzo flippantly yes there was but there was also a tendollar bill i didnt receive the letter and phil fixed his eyes searchingly upon the face of alonzo thats a pretty story said alonzo i dont believe uncle oliver would be such a fool as to send you ten dollars if he did you got it and now want to get as much more pretending you havent received it you are mistaken said phil quietly if you didnt get the letter how do you know any was written and that there was anything in it asked alonzo triumphantly feeling that the question was a crusher i dont care to tell you how i know it do you deny it i dont remember whether uncle oliver gave me any letter or not will you be kind enough to give me his address in florida so that i may write to him and find out no i wont said alonzo angrily and i think you are very cheeky to ask such a thing ma was right when she said that you were the most impudent boy she ever came across thats enough alonzo said phil quietly ive found out all i wanted to what have you found out asked alonzo his tone betraying some apprehension never mind i think i know what became of that letter do you mean to say i opened it and took out the money demanded alonzo reddening i wouldnt charge anybody with such a mean act unless i felt satisfied of it youd better not said alonzo in a bullying tone if i find out who youre working for ill let him know that pa bounced you just as you please i dont think that any words of yours will injure me with the gentleman i have the good fortune to work for dont you be too sure if you think he wouldnt mind a boy ill refer him to pa and ma theyll give you a good setting out i dont doubt it said phil indifferently and turned to go away he was called back by alonzo who had not quite satisfied his curiosity say are you boarding with that woman who came to see ma the same day you were at the house he asked no i have left her alonzo looked well pleased he knew that his mother felt rather uneasy at the two being together dreading lest they should make a concerted attempt to ingratiate themselves with her rich uncle ma says she behaved very badly alonzo could not help adding mrs forbush is an excellent lady said phil warmly for he could not hear one of his friends spoken against lady shes as poor as poverty sneered alonzo she is none the worse for that uncle oliver cant bear her indeed said phil pausing to see what else alonzo would say ma says she disgraced herself and all her relations gave her up when you see her tell her she had better not come sneaking round the house again if you will write a letter to that effect i will see that she gets it said phil that letter wont miscarry i dont care to take any notice of her said alonzo loftily you are very kind to have wasted so much notice upon me said phil amused alonzo did not see fit to answer this but walked away with his head in the air he was however not quite easy in mind how in the world he asked himself could that boy have found out that uncle oliver gave me a letter to post if he should learn that i opened it and took the money thered be a big fuss i guess id better not meet him again if i see him any day ill go in a different direction hes so artful he may get me into trouble it is needless to say that neither mr or mrs pitkin knew of alonzos tampering with the letter much as they would have been opposed to phils receiving such a letter they would have been too wise to sanction such a bold step well said mr carter when phil returned did you see rebecca mrs forbush yes sir and handed her the money she was overjoyed not so much at receiving so generous a sum as at learning that you were reconciled to her poor girl said the old man forgetting that she was now a worn woman i am afraid that she must have suffered much she has met with many hardships sir but she wont mind them now if i live her future shall be brighter than her past i will call tomorrow you philip shall go with me i should like to do so sir by the way i met alonzo on broadway he detailed the conversation that had taken place between them i am afraid he took the money said mr carter i am sorry any relative of mine should have acted in that way let him keep it any benefit he may derive from it will prove to have been dearly purchased chapter xxvi a wonderful change you may order a carriage philip said mr carter the next morning pick out a handsome one with seats for four yes sir in five minutes the carriage was at the door now philip we will go to see my longneglected niece mrs forbush give the driver the necessary directions mrs forbush does not have many carriagecallers said philip smiling perhaps she will have more hereafter said mr carter i ought not so long to have lost sight of her i always liked rebecca better than lavinia yet i let the latter prejudice me against her cousin who is in disposition education and sincerity her superior you see philip there are old fools in the world as well as young ones it is never too late to mend mr carter said phil smiling thats very true even if it is a young philosopher who says it i dont claim any originality for it mr carter by the way philip i have noticed that you always express yourself very correctly your education must be good yes sir thanks to my father or the man whom i always regarded as my father i am a fair latin scholar and know something of greek were you preparing for college asked mr carter with interest yes sir would you like to go i should have gone had father lived but my stepmother said it was foolishness and would be money thrown away perhaps she preferred to incur that expense for her own son suggested the old gentleman jonas wouldnt consent to that he detests study and would decidedly object to going to college by the way you havent heard from them lately only that they have left our old home and gone no one knows where that is strange by this time they had reached the humble dwelling occupied by mrs forbush and so this is where rebecca lives said mr carter yes sir it is not quite so nice as mrs pitkins no returned mr carter thoughtfully philip rang the bell and the two were admitted into the humble parlor they had not long to wait for mrs forbush who with an agitation which she could not overcome entered the presence of her long estranged and wealthy uncle rebecca exclaimed the old gentleman rising and showing some emotion as he saw the changes which fifteen years had made in the niece whom he had last met as a girl uncle oliver how kind you are to visit me cried mrs forbush the tears starting from her eyes kind nonsense i have been very unkind to neglect you so long but it wasnt all my fault there were others who did all they could to keep us apart you have lost your husband yes uncle he was poor but he was one of the kindest and best of men and made me happy i begin to think i have been an old fool rebecca philip thinks so too oh mr carter exclaimed our hero yes you do philip asserted mr carter and you are quite right however as you told me it is never too late to mend mrs forbush will think i take strange liberties with you sir i dont object to good advice even from a boy but who is this julia had just entered the room she was a bright attractive girl but held back bashfully until her mother said julia this is uncle oliver carter you have heard me speak of him yes mamma and scold about him i dare say well julia come and give your old uncle a kiss julia blushed but obeyed her uncles request i should know she was your child rebecca she looks as you did at her age now tell me have you any engagement this morning you two no uncle oliver then i will find one for you i have a carriage at the door you will please put on your bonnets we are going shopping shopping yes i am going to fit out both of you in a manner more befitting relatives of mine the fact is niece rebecca you are actually shabby i know it uncle but there has been so many ways of spending money that i have had to neglect my dress very likely i understand things are different now now dont be over an hour getting ready we are not fashionable uncle said mrs forbush and we havent any change to make they entered the carriage and drove to a large and fashionable store where everything necessary to a ladys toilet including dresses quite complete could be obtained mrs forbush was in favor of selecting very plain articles but her uncle overruled her and pointed out costumes much more costly but uncle objected mrs forbush these things wont at all correspond with our plain home and mode of living think of a boardinghouse keeper arrayed like a fine lady you are going to give up taking boarders that is you will have none but philip and myself will you really live with us uncle but the house is too poor of course it is but you are going to move i will speak further on this point when you are through your purchases at length the shopping was over and they reentered the carriage drive to no madison avenue said mr carter to the driver uncle oliver you have given the wrong direction no rebecca i know what i am about do you live on madison avenue asked mrs forbush i am going to and so are you you must know that i own a furnished house on madison avenue the late occupants sailed for europe last week and i was looking out for a tenant when i found you you will move there tomorrow and act as house keeper taking care of philip and myself i hope julia and you will like it as well as your present home how can i thank you for all your kindness uncle oliver said mrs forbush with joyful tears it will be living once more it will be such a rest from the hard struggle i have had of late years you can repay me by humoring all my whims said uncle oliver smiling you will find me very tyrannical the least infraction of my rules will lead me to send you all packing am i to be treated in the same way mr carter asked philip exactly then if you discharge me i will fly for refuge to mr pitkin that will be out of the fryingpan into the fire with a vengeance by this time they had reached the house it was an elegant brownstone front and proved on entrance to be furnished in the most complete and elegant manner mr carter selected the second floor for his own use a goodsized room on the third was assigned to philip and mrs forbush was told to select such rooms for julia and herself as she desired this is much finer than mrs pitkins house said philip yes it is she will be jealous when she hears of it no doubt that is precisely what i desire it will be a fitting punishment for her treatment of her own cousin it was arranged that on the morrow mrs forbush and julia should close their small house leaving directions to sell the humble furniture at auction while mr carter and philip would come up from the astor house what will the pitkins say when they hear of it thought philip i am afraid they will feel bad chapter xxvii an unpleasant surprise while these important changes were occurring in the lives of philip brent and the poor cousin mrs pitkin remained in blissful ignorance of what was going on alonzo had told her of his encounter with phil on broadway and the intelligence our hero gave him of his securing a place you may rest assured the boy was lying lonny said mrs pitkin boys dont get places so easily especially when they cant give a recommendation from their last employer thats just what i thought ma said alonzo still phil looked in good spirits and he was as saucy as ever i can believe the last very well lonny the boy is naturally impertinent they were probably put on to deceive you but how does he get money to pay his way said alonzo puzzled as to that he is probably selling papers or blacking boots in the lower part of the city he could make enough to live on and of course he wouldnt let you know what he was doing i hope youre right ma id give ever so much to catch him blacking boots in city hall park or anywhere else id give him a job wouldnt he feel mortified to be caught no doubt he would ive a great mind to go down town tomorrow and look about for him very well lonny you may to if you want to alonzo did go but he looked in vain for phil the latter was employed in doing some writing and attending to some accounts for mr carter who had by this time found that his protege was thoroughly well qualified for such work so nearly a week passed it so chanced that though uncle oliver had now been in new york a considerable time not one of the pitkins had met him or had reason to suspect that he was nearer than florida one day however among mrs pitkins callers was mrs vangriff a fashionable acquaintance mr oliver carter is your uncle i believe said the visitor yes i met him on broadway the other day he was looking very well it must have been a fortnight since then uncle oliver is in florida in florida repeated mrs vangriff in surprise when did he go when was it lonny asked mrs pitkin appealing to her son it will be two weeks next thursday there must be some mistake said the visitor i saw mr carter on broadway near twentieth street day before yesterday quite a mistake i assure you mrs vangriff said mrs pitkin smiling it was some other person you were deceived by a fancied resemblance it is you who are wrong mrs pitkin said mrs vangriff positively i am somewhat acquainted with mr carter and i stopped to speak with him are you sure of this asked mrs pitkin looking startled certainly i am sure of it did you call him by name certainly and even inquired after you he answered that he believed you were well i thought he was living with you so he was answered mrs pitkin coolly as possible considering the startling nature of the information she had received probably uncle oliver returned sooner than he anticipated and was merely passing through the city he has important business interests at the west i dont think he was merely passing through the city for a friend of mine saw him at the fifth avenue theater last evening mrs pitkin actually turned as pale as her sallow complexion would admit i am rather surprised to hear this i admit she said was he alone do you know no he had a lady and a boy with him is it possible that uncle oliver has been married to some designing widow mrs pitkin asked herself it is positively terrible she did not dare to betray her agitation before mrs vangriff and sat on thorns till that lady saw fit to take leave then she turned to alonzo and said in a hollow voice lonny you heard what that woman said you bet do you think uncle oliver has gone and got married again she asked in a hollow voice i shouldnt wonder a mite ma was the not consolitary reply if so what will become of us my poor boy i looked upon you and myself as likely to receive all of uncle olivers handsome property as it is and she almost broke down perhaps hes only engaged suggested alonzo to be sure said his mother brightening up if so the affair may yet be broken off oh lonny i never thought your uncle was so artful his trip to florida was only a trick to put us off the scent what are you going to do about it ma i must find out as soon as possible where uncle oliver is staying then i will see him and try to cure him of his infatuation he is evidently trying to keep us in the dark or he would have come back to his rooms how are you going to find out ma i dont know thats what puzzles me spose you hire a detective i wouldnt dare to your uncle would be angry when he found it out do you spose phil knows anything about it suggested alonzo i dont know it is hardly probable do you know where he lives with the woman who called here and said she was your cousin yes i remember lonny i will order the carriage and we will go there but you must be very careful not to let them know uncle oliver is in new york i dont wish them to meet him all right i aint a fool you can trust me ma soon the pitkin carriage was as the door and mrs pitkin and alonzo entered it and were driven to the shabby house so recently occupied by mrs forbush its a low place said alonzo contemptuously as he regarded disdainfully the small dwelling yes but i suppose it is as good as she can afford to live in lonny will you get out and ring the bell ask if mrs forbush lives there alonzo did as requested the door was opened by a small girl whose shabby dress was in harmony with the place rebeccas child i suppose said mrs pitkin who was looking out of the carriage window does mrs forbush live here asked alonzo no she doesnt mrs kavanagh lives here didnt mrs forbush used to live here further asked alonzo at the suggestion of his mother i believe she did she moved out a week ago do you know where she moved to no i dont does a boy named philip brent live here no he doesnt do you know why mrs forbush moved away asked alonzo again at the suggestion of his mother guess she couldnt pay her rent very likely said alonzo who at last had received an answer with which he was pleased well ma there isnt any more to find out here he said tell the driver home said his mother when they reached the house in twelfth street there was a surprise in store for them who do you thinks upstairs mum said hannah looking important who tell me quick its your uncle oliver mum just got home from florida but i guess hes going somewhere else mum for hes packing up his things alonzo we will go up and see him said mrs pitkin excited i must know what all this means chapter xxviii an unsatisfactory conference mr carter was taking articles from a bureau and packing them away in an open trunk when mrs pitkin entered with alonzo it is needless to say that his niece regarded his employment with dismay for it showed clearly that he proposed to leave the shelter of her roof uncle oliver she exclaimed sinking into a chair and gazing at the old gentleman spellbound mr carter whose back had been turned turned about and faced his niece oh it is you lavinia he said quietly what are you doing asked his niece as you see i am packing my trunk do you intend to leave us faltered mrs pitkin i think it will be well for me to make a change said mr carter this is indeed a sad surprise said mrs pitkin mournfully when did you return from florida i have never been there i changed my mind when i reached charleston how long have you been in the city about a week and never came near us this is indeed unkind in what way have we offended you and mrs pitkin put her handkerchief to her eyes there were no tears in them but she was making an attempt to touch the heart of her uncle are you aware that rebecca forbush is in the city asked the old gentleman abruptly yees answered mrs pitkin startled have you seen her yees she came here one day and how did you treat her asked mr carter severely did you not turn the poor woman from the house having no regard for her evident poverty did you not tell her that i was very angry with her and would not hear her name mentioned yees i may have said so you know uncle oliver you have held no communication with her for many years that is true more shame to me and i thought i was carrying out your wishes in discouraging her visits you also thought that she might be a dangerous rival in my favor and might deprive you and alonzo of an expected share in my estate oh uncle oliver how can you think so poorly of me mr carter eyed his niece with a halfsmile so i do you injustice do i lavinia he returned yes great injustice i am glad to hear it i feel less objection now to telling you what are my future plans what are they asked mrs pitkin apprehensively i have lived for ten years under your roof and have had no communication as you say with rebecca i think it is only fair now that i should show her some attention i have accordingly installed her as mistress of my house in madison avenue and shall henceforth make my home with her mrs pitkin felt as if the earth was sinking under her feet the hopes and schemes of so many years had come to naught and her hated and dreaded cousin was to be constantly in the society of the rich uncle rebecca has played her cards well she said bitterly she has not played them at all she did not seek me i sought her how did you know she was in the city i learned it from philip there was fresh dismay so that boy has wormed his way into your confidence said mrs pitkin bitterly after acting so badly that mr pitkin was obliged to discharge him he ran to you to do us a mischief why was he discharged demanded mr carter sternly why did your husband seize the opportunity to get rid of a boy in whom he knew me to be interested as soon as he thought i was out of the way why moreover did he refuse the boy a reference without which philip could scarcely hope to get employment you will have to ask mr pitkin i am sure he had good reason for the course he took hes an impudent low upstart in my opinion so he is ma chimed in alonzo with heartiness ah i have something to say to you alonzo said mr carter turning his keen glances upon the boy what became of that letter i gave to you to post just before i went away i put it in the letterbox said alonzo nervously do you know what was in it no answered alonzo but he looked frightened there were ten dollars in it that letter never reached phil to whom it was addressed i dont know anything about it faltered alonzo there are ways of finding out whether letters have been posted said mr carter i might put a detective on the case alonzo turned pale and looked much discomposed of what are you accusing my boy asked mrs pitkin ready to contend for her favorite so that boy has been telling lies about him has he and you believe scandalous stories about your own flesh and blood not exactly that lavinia well your near relation and that on the testimony of a boy you know nothing about when lonny is so devoted to you too i never noticed any special devotion said mr carter amused you are mistaken however about philip trying to injure him i simply asked philip whether he had received such a letter and he said no i dare say he did receive it said mrs pitkin spitefully we wont argue the matter now said the old gentleman i will only say that you and alonzo and mr pitkin also have gone the wrong way to work to secure my favor you have done what you could to injure two persons one your own cousin because you were jealous you judge me very hardly uncle said mrs pitkin seeing that she must adopt a different course i have no bad feeling against rebecca and as to the boy i will ask my husband to take him back into the store i am sure he will do it because you wish it i dont wish it answered mr carter rather unexpectedly oh well answered mrs pitkin looking relieved that is as you say i have other views for philip said mr carter he is with me as my private secretary is he living with you asked his niece in alarm yes there was no need of taking a stranger uncle oliver we should be glad to have alonzo act as your secretary though of course we should want him to stay at home i shall not deprive you of alonzo said mr carter with a tinge of sarcasm in his tone philip will suit me better mr carter turned and resumed his packing are you quite determined to leave us asked mrs pitkin in a subdued tone yes it will be better but you will come back say after a few weeks no i think not he answered dryly and shall we not see you at all oh i shall call from time to time and besides you will know where i am and can call whenever you desire people will talk about your leaving us complained mrs pitkin let them talk i never agreed to have my movements controlled by peoples gossip and now lavinia i shall have to neglect you and resume my packing tomorrow i shall bring philip here to help me would you like to have alonzo help you uncle oliver this offer much to alonzos relief was declined he feared that he should be examined more closely by the old gentleman about the missing money which at that very moment he had in his pocket mrs pitkin went down stairs feeling angry and baffled all that she had done to retain her ascendency over uncle oliver had failed and mrs forbush and philip seemed to have superseded herself and alonzo in his regard she conferred with mr pitkin on his return from the store but the more they considered the matter the worse it looked for their prospects could anything be done chapter xxix a truce no more distasteful news could have come to the pitkins than to learn that philip and their poor cousin had secured a firm place in the good graces of uncle oliver yet they did not dare to show their resentment they had found that uncle oliver had a will of his own and meant to exercise it had they been more forbearing he would still be an inmate of their house instead of going over to the camp of their enemies for so they regarded mrs forbush and phil i hate that woman mr pitkin said his wife fiercely i scorn such underhanded work how she has sneaked into the good graces of poor deluded uncle oliver you have played your cards wrong lavinia said her husband peevishly i that is a strange accusation mr pitkin it was you to my thinking you sent off that errand boy and that is how the whole thing came about if he had been in your store he wouldnt have met uncle oliver down at the pier you and alonzo persuaded me to discharge him oh of course its alonzo and me when you see rebecca forbush and that errand boy making ducks and drakes out of uncle olivers money you may wish you had acted more wisely really lavinia you are a most unreasonable woman its no use criminating and recriminating we must do what we can to mend matters what can we do they havent got the money yet remember that we must try to reestablish friendly relations with mr carter perhaps youll tell me how certainly call as soon as possible at the house on madison avenue call on that woman yes and try to smooth matters over as well as you can take alonzo with you and instruct him to be polite to philip i dont believe lonny will be willing to demean himself so far hell have to answered mr pitkin firmly weve all made a mistake and the sooner we remedy it the better mrs pitkin thought it over the advice was unpalatable but it was evidently sound uncle oliver was rich and they must not let his money slip through their fingers so after duly instructing alonzo in his part mrs pitkin a day or two later ordered her carriage and drove in state to the house of her once poor relative is mrs forbush at home she asked of the servant i believe so madam answered a dignified manservant take this card to her mrs pitkin and alonzo were ushered into a drawingroom more elegant than their own she sat on a sofa with alonzo who would think that rebecca forbush would come to live like this she said half to herself and that boy supplemented alonzo to be sure your uncle is fairly infatuated just then mrs forbush entered followed by her daughter she was no longer clad in a shabby dress but wore an elegant toilet handsome beyond her own wishes but insisted upon by uncle oliver i am glad to see you lavinia she said simply this is my daughter julia too was stylishly dressed and alonzo in spite of his prejudices could not help regarding this handsome cousin with favor i do not propose to detail the interview mrs pitkin was on her good behavior and appeared very gracious mrs forbush could not help recalling the difference between her demeanor now and on the recent occasion when in her shabby dress she called at the house in twelfth street but she was too generous to recall it as they were about to leave mr carter and philip entered the room sent for by mrs forbush how do you do philip said mrs pitkin graciously alonzo this is philip how do growled alonzo staring enviously at phils handsome new suit which was considerably handsomer than his own very well alonzo you must come and see lonny said mrs pitkin pleasantly thank you answered phil politely he did not say it was a pleasure for he was a boy of truth and he did not feel that it would be uncle oliver was partially deceived by his nieces new manner he was glad that there seemed to be a reconciliation and he grew more cordial than he had been since his return after awhile mrs pitkin rose to go when she was fairly in the carriage once more she said passionately how i hate them you were awful sweet on them ma said alonzo opening his eyes i had to be but the time will come when i will open the eyes of uncle oliver to the designs of that scheming woman and that artful errand boy it was mrs pitkins true self that spoke chapter xxx phils trust among the duties which devolved upon phil was mr carters bank business he generally made deposits for uncle oliver and drew money on his personal checks whenever he needed it it has already been said that mr carter was a silent partner in the firm of which mr pitkin was the active manager the arrangement between the partners was that each should draw out two hundred dollars a week toward current expenses and that the surplus if any at the end of the year should be divided according to the terms of the partnership when phil first presented himself with a note from mr carter he was an object of attention to the clerks who knew that he had been discharged by mr pitkin yet here he was dressed in a new suit provided with a watch and wearing every mark of prosperity one of the most surprised was mr g washington wilbur with whom as an old friend phil stopped to chat is old pitkin going to take you back he inquired no answered phil promptly he couldnt have me if he wanted me have you got another place yes whats the firm it isnt in business i am private secretary to mr carter mr wilbur regarded him with surprise and respect is it a soft place he inquired its a very pleasant place what wages do you get twelve dollars a week and board you dont mean it yes i do say doesnt he want another secretary asked mr wilbur no i think not id like a place of that sort youre a lucky fellow phil i begin to think i am of course you dont live at the old place no i live on madison avenue by the way wilbur how is your ladylove mr wilbur looked radiant i think im getting on he said i met her the other evening and she smiled that is encouraging said phil as soberly as possible all things come to him who waits thats what i had to write in my copybook once phil was received by mr pitkin with more graciousness than he expected he felt that he must do what he could to placate uncle oliver but he was more dangerous when friendly in his manner than when he was rude and impolite he was even now plotting to get phil into a scrape which should lose him the confidence of uncle oliver generally phil was paid in a check payable to the order of mr carter but one saturday two hundred dollars in bills were placed in his hands instead you see how much confidence i place in your honesty said mr pitkin you couldnt use the check this money you could make off with it would be very foolish to say the least responded phil of course of course i know you are trustworthy or i would have given you a check instead when phil left the building he was followed though he did not know it by a man looking like a clerk ah phil you are in danger though you dont suspect it chapter xxxi phil is shadowed phil felt that he must be more than usually careful because the money he had received was in the form of bills which unlike the check would be of use to any thief appropriating it that he was in any unusual danger however he was far from suspecting he reached broadway and instead of taking an omnibus started to walk uptown he knew there was no haste and a walk up the great busy thoroughfare had its attractions for him as it has for many others behind him preserving a distance of from fifteen to twenty feet walked a darkcomplexioned man of not far from forty years of age of course phil was not likely to notice him whatever the mans designs might be he satisfied himself at first with simply keeping our hero in view but as they both reached bleecker street he suddenly increased his pace and caught up with phil he touched the boy on the shoulder breathing quickly as if he had been running phil turned quickly do you want me sir he asked eying the stranger in surprise i dont know perhaps i am mistaken are you in the employ of mr oliver carter yes sir ah i then you are the boy i want i have bad news for you bad news repeated phil alarmed what is it mr carter was seized with a fit in the street half an hour since is he dead asked phil in dismay no no i think he will come out all right where is he in my house i didnt of course know who he was but i found in his pocket a letter directed to oliver carter madison avenue there was also a business card he is connected in business with mr pitkin is he not yes sir answered phil where is your house in bleecker street near by mr carter is lying on the bed he is unconscious but my wife heard him say call philip i suppose that is you yes sir my name is philip i went around to his place of business and was told that you had just left there i was given a description of you and hurried to find you will you come to the house and see mr carter yes sir answered phil forgetting everything except that his kind and generous employer was sick perhaps dangerously thank you i shall feel relieved of course you can communicate with his friends and arrange to have him carried home yes sir i live at his house that is well they had turned down bleecker street when it occurred to phil to say i dont understand how mr carter should be in this neighborhood that is something i cant explain as i know nothing about his affairs said the stranger pleasantly perhaps he may have property on the street i dont think so i attend to much of his business and he would have sent me if there had been anything of that kind to attend to i dare say you are right said his companion of course i know nothing about it i only formed a conjecture has a physician been sent for asked phil do you know of any we can call in my wife agreed to send for one on sixth avenue said the stranger i didnt wait for him to come but set out for the store nothing could be more ready or plausible than the answers of his new acquaintance and phil was by no means of a suspicious temperament had he lived longer in the city it might have occurred to him that there was something rather unusual in the circumstances but he knew that mr carter had spoken of leaving the house at the breakfasttable indeed had left it before he himself had set out for the store for the time being the thought of the sum of money which he carried with him had escaped his memory but it was destined very soon to be recalled to his mind they had nearly reached sixth avenue when his guide stopped in front of a shabby brick house this is where i live he said we will go in he produced a key opened the door and phil accompanied him up a shabby staircase to the third floor he opened the door of a rear room and made a sign to phil to enter chapter xxxii phil is robbed when he was fairly in the room phil looked about him expecting to see mr carter but the room appeared unoccupied he turned to his companion a look of surprise on his face but he was destined to be still more surprised and that not in a pleasant way his guide had locked the door from the inside and put the key in his pocket what does that mean asked phil with sudden apprehension what do you refer to asked his guide with an unpleasant smile why do you lock the door i thought it might be safest was the significant answer i dont believe mr carter is in the house at all said phil quickly i dont believe he is either youngster why did you tell me he was here demanded phil with rising indignation i thought you wouldnt come if i didnt replied his companion nonchalantly answer me one thing is mr carter sick at all not that i know of then i am trapped precisely you may as well know the truth now phil had already conjectured the reason why he had been enticed to this poor dwelling the two hundred dollars which he had in his pocket made him feel very uncomfortable i think i may say truly that if the money had been his own he would have been less disturbed but he thought with a sinking heart that if the money should be taken from him he would himself fall under suspicion and he could not bear to have mr carter think that he had repaid his kindness with such black ingratitude he might be mistaken the man before him might not know he had such a sum of money in his possession and of course he was not going to give him the information i am glad mr carter is all right said phil now tell me why you have taken such pains to get me here why as to that said his companion there were at least two hundred good reasons phil turned pale for he understood now that in some way his secret was known what do you mean he asked not wholly able to conceal his perturbed feelings you know well enough boy said the other significantly youve got two hundred dollars in your pocket i want it are you a thief then said phil with perhaps imprudent boldness just take care what you say i wont be insulted by such a whippersnapper as you youd better not call names hand over that money how do you know i have any money phil asked trying to gain a little time for deliberation no matter hand it over i say dont take it said phil agitated it isnt mine then you neednt mind giving it up it belongs to mr carter he has plenty more but he will think i took it he will think i am dishonest that is nothing to me let me go pleaded phil and i will never breathe a word about your wanting to rob me you know you might get into trouble for it thats all bosh the money i say said the man sternly i wont give it to you said phil boldly you wont hey then i shall have to take it if i hurt you you will have yourself to blame so saying the man seized phil and then a struggle ensued the boy defending himself as well as he could he made a stouter resistance than the thief anticipated and the latter became irritated with the amount of trouble he had to take it i should be glad to report that phil made a successful defense but this was hardly to be expected he was a strong boy but he had to cope with a strong man and though right was on his side virtue in his case had to succumb to triumphant vice phil was thrown down and when prostrate with the mans knee on his breast the latter succeeded in stripping him of the money he had so bravely defended there you young rascal he said as he rose to his feet you see how much good you have done you might as well have given up the money in the first place it was my duty to keep it from you if i could said phil panting with his exertions well if thats any satisfaction to you youre welcome to it he went to the door and unlocked it may i go now asked phil not much stay where you are a moment later and phil found himself alone and a prisoner chapter xxxiii a terrible situation phil tried the door but now it was locked on the outside and he found that he was securely trapped he went to the window but here too there was no chance of escape even if he had been able to get safely out he would have landed in a backyard from which there was no egress except through the house which was occupied by his enemies what shall i do phil asked himself despairingly mr carter will be anxious about me and perhaps he may think i have gone off with the money this to phil was the worst of his troubles he prized a good reputation and the possession of an honorable name and to be thought a thief would distress him exceedingly what a fool i was to walk into such a trap he said to himself i might have known mr carter would not be in such a neighborhood phil was too severe upon himself i suspect that most of my boy readers even those who account themselves sharp might have been deceived as easily the fact is rogues are usually plausible and they are so trained in deception that it is no reflection upon their victims that they allow themselves to be taken in hours passed and still phil found himself a prisoner each moment he became more anxious and troubled how long will they keep me he asked himself they cant keep me here forever about six oclock the door was opened slightly and a plate of bread and butter was thrust in together with a glass of cold water who brought it up phil did not know for the person did not show himself or herself phil ate and drank what was provided not that he was particularly hungry but he felt that he must keep up his strength they dont mean to starve me at any rate he reflected that is some consolation while there is life there is hope a little over an hour passed it became dark in phils prison but he had no means of lighting the gas there was a small bed in the room and he made up his mind that he must sleep there all at once there was a confused noise and disturbance he could not make out what it meant till above all other sounds he heard the terrible cry of fire fire where is it thought phil it was not long before he made a terrible discovery it was the very house in which he was confined there was a trampling of feet and a chorus of screams the smoke penetrated into the room heavens am i to be burned alive thought our poor hero he jumped up and down on the floor pounded frantically on the door and at last the door was broken open by a stalwart fireman and phil made his way out halfsuffocated once in the street he made his way as fast as possible homeward chapter xxxiv phils friends and his enemies meanwhile phils long absence had excited anxiety and alarm what can have become of philip said mr carter when supper time came and he did not arrive i cant think answered mrs forbush he is generally very prompt that is what makes me feel anxious i am afraid something must have happened to him did you send him anywhere uncle oliver yes he called as usual to get my check from mr pitkin and he ought to have been here earlier certainly he wouldnt have to wait for that philip is very careful i cant think that he has met with an accident even the most prudent and careful get into trouble sometimes they were finally obliged to sit down to supper alone none of the three enjoyed it not only mr carter and mrs forbush but julia was anxious and troubled i didnt know i cared so much for the boy said uncle oliver he has endeared himself to me i care nothing for the loss of the money if he will only return safe it was about a quarter of eight when the doorbell rang and the servant ushered in mr and mrs pitkin and alonzo after the usual greetings were interchanged mrs pitkin said looking about her where is philip we are very much concerned about him said mr carter his face showing his trouble he has not been home since morning did he call at your store pitkin hasnt he been home since asked pitkin in a tone unpleasantly significant no at what time did he leave the store hours since i i am not sure but i may be able to throw some light on his failure to return do so if you can said uncle oliver in place of giving him a check i gave the boy two hundred dollars in bills well dont you see the temptation has proved too strong for him i think uncle oliver you wont see him back in a hurry do you mean to say the boy would steal demanded the old gentleman indignantly i think it more than likely that he has appropriated the money i am sure he has not said mrs forbush and so am i chimed in julia mr pitkin shrugged his shoulders so you think he answered but i dont agree with you nor i said mrs pitkin nodding her head vigorously i never had any confidence in the boy i dont mind telling you now that i have warned alonzo not to get too intimate with him you remember it lonny yesm responded lonny then you think the boy capable of appropriating the money asked mr carter quietly yes i do well i dont said uncle oliver emphatically you are very easily deceived said mrs pitkin dont be too sure of that returned mr carter with a significant glance that made his niece feel uncomfortable i suspect you will have to admit it said mr pitkin if contrary to my anticipation the boy returns and brings the money with him i will own myself mistaken just then the front door was heard to open there was a sound of steps in the hall and phil came hurriedly into the room mr and mrs pitkin exchanged looks of surprise and dismay but mrs forbush her daughter and uncle oliver looked delighted chapter xxxv the pitkins retire in disgust where have you been philip asked mr carter breaking the silence we were getting anxious about you i have bad news for you sir returned phil saying what stood first in his mind i have lost the two hundred dollars mr pitkin paid me this morning so you lost it observed mr pitkin with a sneer emphasizing the word lost to show his incredulity yes sir i lost it answered phil looking him fearlessly in the eye or rather it was stolen from me oh now it is stolen is it repeated pitkin really uncle oliver this is getting interesting i believe i am the proper person to question philip said mr carter coldly it was my money i take it yes it was yours as i made the payment i cannot of course be responsible for its not reaching you you will pardon my saying that it would have been wiser to employ a different messenger why demanded uncle oliver looking displeased why really uncle oliver said mr pitkin i should think the result might convince you of that we had better let philip tell his story said mr carter quietly how did it happen philip thereupon philip told the story already familiar to the reader upon my word quite a romantic story commented mr pitkin unable to repress a sneer so you were tracked by a rascal lured into a den of thieves robbed of your money or rather mr carters and only released by the house catching fire that is exactly what happened to me sir said philip coloring with indignation for he saw that mr pitkin was doing his best to discredit him it quite does credit to your imagination by the way boy have you been in the habit of reading dime novels i never read one in my life sir then i think you would succeed in writing them for a boy of sixteen you certainly have a vivid imagination i quite agree with my husband said mrs pitkin the boys story is ridiculously improbable i cant understand how he has the face to stand there and expect uncle oliver to swallow such rubbish i dont expect you to believe it either of you said philip manfully for you have never treated me fairly i think you will find also that my uncle is too sensible a man to credit it also retorted mrs pitkin speak for yourself lavinia said mr carter who had waited intentionally to let his relatives express themselves i believe every word of philips story you do ejaculated mrs pitkin rolling her eyes and nodding her head in the vain endeavor to express her feelings really uncle oliver for a man of your age and good sense thank you for that admission lavinia said mr carter mockingly go on i was about to say that you seem infatuated with this boy of whom we know nothing except from his own account to my mind his story is a most ridiculous invention mr pitkin did any one enter your store just after philip left it to inquire after him no sir answered pitkin triumphantly thats a lie at any rate you will remember that philip did not make the assertion himself this was the statement of the thief who robbed him yes of course sneered pitkin he told his story very shrewdly mr carter said philip i can show you or any one else the house in which i was confined in bleecker street and there will be no trouble in obtaining proof of the fire i dare say there may have been such a fire said mr pitkin and you may have happened to see it and decided to weave it into your story do you think i stole the money or used it for my own purpose asked philip pointedly mr pitkin shrugged his shoulders young man he said upon this point i can only say that your story is grossly improbable it wont hold water permit me to judge of that mr pitkin said mr carter i wish to ask you one question to ask me a question said pitkin surprised yes why did you pay philip in bills today why didnt you give him a check as usual why answered pitkin hesitating i thought it wouldnt make any difference to you i thought you would be able to use it more readily did you suppose i would specially need to use money instead of a check this week why break over your usual custom really i didnt give much thought to the matter answered pitkin hesitating i acted on a sudden impulse your impulse has cost me two hundred dollars do me the favor when philip calls next week to hand him a check you mean to retain him in your employ after this asked mrs pitkin sharply yes i do why shouldnt i you are very trustful observed the lady tossing her head if this had happened to lonny here we should never have heard the last of it perhaps not responded the old gentleman dryly when a young gentleman is trusted with a letter to mail containing money and that letter never reaches its destination it may at least be inferred that he is careless it will be remembered that this was the first knowledge mrs pitkin or her husband had of the transaction referred to what do you mean uncle oliver demanded mr pitkin mr carter explained this is too much said mrs pitkin angrily you mean to accuse my poor boy of opening the letter and stealing the money if i was as ready to bring accusations as you lavinia i should undoubtedly say that it looked a little suspicious but i prefer to let the matter rest i think mr pitkin we had better go said mrs pitkin rising with dignity since uncle oliver chooses to charge his own nephew with being a thief i beg pardon lavinia i have not done so you might just as well said lavinia pitkin tossing her head come mr pitkin come my poor lonny we will go home this is no place for you goodevening lavinia said mr carter calmly i shall be glad to see you whenever you feel like calling when you have discharged that boy i may call again said mrs pitkin spitefully you will have to wait some time then i am quite capable of managing my own affairs when mr pitkin had left the house by no means in a good humor phil turned to his employer and said gratefully i dont know how to thank you mr carter for your kind confidence in me i admit that the story i told you is a strange one and i could not have blamed you for doubting me but i dont doubt you my dear philip said mr carter kindly nor i said mrs forbush i feel provoked with lavinia and her husband for trying to throw discredit upon your statement in fact said mr carter humorously the only one of us that suspected you was julia oh uncle oliver exclaimed julia in dismay i never dreamed of doubting phil then said mr carter it appears that you have three friends at least if said phil you would allow me to make up part of the loss by surrendering a part of my salary couldnt be thought of philip said uncle oliver resolutely i dont care for the money but i should like to know how the thief happened to know that today you received money instead of a check without saying a word to phil uncle oliver called the next day on a noted detective and set him to work ferreting out the secret chapter xxxvi the false heir in the suburbs of chicago perhaps a dozen miles from the great city stands a fine country house in the midst of a fine natural park from the cupola which surmounts the roof can be seen in the distance the waters of lake michigan stretching for many miles from north to south and from east to west like a vast inland sea the level lawns the greenhouses the garden with rare plants and flowers show clearly that this is the abode of a rich man my readers will be specially interested to know that this is the luxurious and stately home of mr granville whose sons fortunes we have been following this too is the home of mrs brent and jonas who under false representations have gained a foothold in the home of the western millionaire surely it is a great change for one brought up like jonas to be the recognized heir and supposed son of so rich a man it is a change too for his mother who though she dare not avow the relationship is permitted to share the luxury of her son mrs brent has for her own use two of the best rooms in the mansion and so far as money can bring happiness she has every right to consider herself happy is she not as happy as she anticipated to begin with she is always dreading that some untoward circumstance will reveal the imposition she has practiced upon mr granville in that case what can she expect but to be ejected in disgrace from her luxurious home to be sure she will have her husbands property left but it would be a sad downfall and descent in the social scale besides she finds cause for anxiety in jonas and the change which his sudden and undeserved elevation has wrought in him it requires a strong mind to withstand the allurements and temptations of prosperity and jonas is far from possessing a strong mind he is indeed if i may be allowed the expression a vulgar little snob utterly selfish and intent solely upon his own gratification he has a love for drink and against the protests of his mother and the positive command of mr granville indulges his taste whenever he thinks he can do so without fear of detection to the servants he makes himself very offensive by assuming consequential airs and a lordly bearing which excites their hearty dislike he is making his way across the lawn at this moment he is dressed in clothes of the finest material and the most fashionable cut a thick gold chain is displayed across his waistcoat attached to an expensive gold watch bought for him by his supposed father he carries in his hand a natty cane and struts along with head aloft and nose in the air two undergardeners are at work upon a flowerbed as he passes what time is it master philip says one a boy about a year older than jonas my good boy said jonas haughtily i dont carry a watch for your benefit the gardener bit his lip and surveyed the heir with unequivocal disgust very well he retorted ill wait till a gentleman comes this way a flush of anger was visible on the cheek of jonas despite his freckles do you mean to say im not a gentleman he demanded angrily you dont act like one returned dan youd better not be impertinent to me exclaimed jonas his small gray eyes flashing with indignation take that back i wont for its true said dan undauntedly take that then jonas raised his cane and brought it down smartly on the young gardeners shoulder he soon learned that he had acted imprudently dan dropped his rake sprang forward and seizing the cane wrenched it from the hands of the young heir after which he proceeded to break it across his knee theres your cane he said contemptuously as he threw the pieces on the ground what did you do that for demanded jonas outraged because you insulted me thats why how can i insult you youre only a poor working boy i wouldnt change places with you said dan id like well enough to be rich but i wouldnt be willing to be as mean as you are youll suffer for this said jonas his little beadlike eyes glowing with anger ill have you turned off this very day or as soon as my father gets home if he says im to go ill go said dan hes a gentleman jonas made his way to his mothers room she noticed his perturbed look whats the matter my dear boy she asked whats the matter jonas i wish youd stop calling me your dear boy said jonas angrily i i forget sometimes said mrs brent with a halfsigh then you ought not to forget do you want to spoil everything we are alone now jonas and i cannot forget that i am your mother youd better if you know whats best for both of us said jonas mrs brent was far from being a kindhearted woman indeed she was very cold but jonas was her only son and to him she was as much attached as it was possible for her to be to any one formerly he had returned her affection in a slight degree but since he had figured as a rich mans son and heir he had begun incredible as it may appear to look down upon his own mother she was not wholly ignorant of this change in his feelings and it made her unhappy he was all she had to live for but for him she would not have stooped to take part in the conspiracy in which she was now a participant it seemed hard that her only son for whom she had sinned should prove so ungrateful my boy she said i would not on any account harm you or injure your prospects but when we are alone there can be no harm in my treating you as my son it cant do any good grumbled jonas and we might be overheard i will be cautious you may be sure of that but why do you look so annoyed why reason enough that boy dan the undergardener has been impudent to me he has said mrs brent quickly what has he done jonas rehearsed the story he found in his mother a sympathetic listener he is bold she said compressing her lips yes he is when i told him i would have him turned off he coolly turned round and said that my father was a gentleman and wouldnt send him away ma will you do me a favor what is it jonas send him off before the governor gets home you can make it all right with him mrs brent hesitated mr granville might think i was taking a liberty oh you can make it all right with him say that he was very impudent to me after what has happened if he stays hell think he can treat me just as he pleases again mrs brent hesitated but her own inclination prompted her to do as her son desired you may tell dan to come here i wish to speak to him she said jonas went out and did the errand mrs brent wants to see me said dan i have nothing to do with her youd better come in if you know whats best for yourself said jonas with an exultation he did not attempt to conceal oh well i have no objection to meeting mrs brent said dan ill go in mrs brent eyed the young gardener with cold animosity you have been impudent to master philip she said of course you cannot remain any longer in his fathers employment here are five dollars more than is due you take it and leave the estate i wont take your money mrs brent said dan independently and i wont take my dismissal from any one but mr granville himself do you defy me then said mrs brent with a firmer compression of her lips no mrs brent i dont defy you but you have nothing to do with me and i shall not take any orders or any dismissal from you dont be impertinent to my burst forth from jonas and then he stopped in confusion to your what asked dan quickly to my nurse faltered jonas dan looked suspiciously from one to the other theres something between those two he said to himself something we dont know of chapter xxxvii mrs brents panic the chambermaid in the granville household was a cousin of dan older by three years she took a warm interest in dans welfare though there was nothing but cousinly affection between them fresh from his interview with mrs brent dan made his way to the kitchen well aggie he said i may have to say goodby soon what dan youre not for lavin are you asked aggie in surprise mrs brent has just given me notice answered dan mrs brent what business is it of hers and how did it happen anyway she thinks its her business and its all on account of that stuckup philip tell me about it cousin dan dan did so and wound up by repeating his young masters unfinished sentence its my belief he said that theres something between those two if there wasnt why is mrs brent here why indeed dan chimed in aggie perhaps i can guess something what is it never you mind ill only say i overheard mrs brent one day speaking to master philip but she didnt call him philip what then jonas im ready to take my oath she called him jonas perhaps that is his real name he may have it for his middle name i dont believe it dan ive an idea im going to see mrs brent and make her think i know something you see do as you think best aggie i told her wouldnt take a dismissal from her mrs brent was in her own room she was not a woman who easily forgave and she was provoked with dan who had defied her authority she knew very well that in dismissing him she had wholly exceeded her authority but this as may readily be supposed did not make her feel any more friendly to the young gardener jonas artfully led her indignation dan doesnt have much respect for you mother he said he doesnt mind you any more than he does a kitchengirl he may find he has made a mistake said mrs brent a bright red spot in each cheek indicating her anger he may find he has made a mistake in defying my authority i wouldnt stand it if i was you ma i wont said mrs brent decidedly nodding vigorously and compressing her lips more firmly soon after a knock was heard at mrs brents door come in she said in a sharp incisive voice the door was opened and aggie entered what do you want of me aggie asked mrs brent in some surprise i hear youve been tellin dan hell have to go said the chambermaid yes answered mrs brent but i fail to see what business it is of yours dans me cousin maam thats nothing to me he has been impertinent to master philip and afterward to me i know all about it maam he told me then you understand why he must leave he will do well to be more respectful in his next place it wasnt his fault maam accordin to what he told me no doubt sneered mrs brent it is hardly likely that he would admit himself to be in fault dans a good truthful boy maam what did he tell you the moment had come for aggies masterstroke and she fixed her eyes keenly on mrs brent to watch the effect of her words he said he was at work in the garden maam when master jonas what exclaimed mrs brent staring at the girl in dismay he was at work in the garden maam when master jonas what do you mean girl who is master jonas asked mrs brent trying to conceal her agitation did i say jonas maam la what could i be thinking of of course i mean master philip what should have put the name of jonas into your head demanded mrs brent nervously i must have heard it somewhere said aggie with a quick shrewd look out of the corner of her eyes well dan just asked the young master a civil question and master philip he snapped him up rudelike mrs brent i think youd better not make any fuss about dan it wasnt so much his fault as the fault of master jonas oh dear i beg pardon i mean master philip dont repeat that ridiculous name again aggie said mrs brent your young master has nothing to do with it you ought to know that his name is philip i should say so broke in jonas i aint goin to be called out of my name as to dan proceeded mrs brent i am willing to overlook his impertinence this time i wont say a word to mr granville but he must be more careful hereafter im sure im obliged to you maam said aggie demurely when she was out of the room she nodded to herself triumphantly sure ive got the old lady under me thumb but divil a bit i know how its all in the word jonas when i want a favor all ive got to do is to say that word i wonder what it manes now anyhow however aggie communicated to dan the welcome intelligence that he would have no trouble with mrs brent or philip but as to the way in which she had managed she kept that to herself i want to think it over she said theres a secret and its about jonas ill wait patiently and maybe ill hear some more about it as for mrs brent she was panicstricken uncertain how much aggie knew she feared that she knew all but how could she have discovered it and was it come to this that she and jonas were in the power of an irish chambermaid it was galling to her pride she turned to her son when they were left alone how could she have found out she asked found out what mother that your name is jonas she evidently knows it i could see that in her eyes she must have heard you calling me so ive told you more than once ma that you must never call me anything but philip it is hard to have to keep silent always never to speak to you as my own boy i begin to think it is a dear price to pay jonas there you go again mother said jonas peevishly his mother had seated herself and spoke despondently i am afraid it will all come out some day she said it will if you dont take better care ma i tell you it would be the best thing for you to go away mr granville will give you a good income if i was left alone thered be no fear of its leaking out oh jonas would you really have me leave you would you really have me live by myself separated from my only child cold as she was her heart was keenly wounded for looking at the boy she saw that he was in earnest and that he would prefer to have her go since thereby he would be safer in the position he had usurped chapter xxxviii an important discovery mr carter can you spare me a couple of days asked philip certainly phil answered the old gentleman may i ask how you wish to dispose of the time i would like to go to planktown to see my friends there it is now some months since i left the village and i would like to see my old friends the desire is a natural one your home is broken up is it not yes but i can stay at the house of tommy kavanagh i know he will be glad to have me it is strange that your stepmother and her son have left no trace behind them said mr carter thoughtfully it looks suspicious as if they had some good reason for their disappearance i cant understand why they should have left planktown said philip appearing puzzled is the house occupied yes i hear that a cousin of mrs brent occupies it i shall call and inquire after her very well philip go when you please you may be sure of a welcome when you return in planktown though his home relations latterly had not been pleasant philip had many friends and when he appeared on the street he met everywhere glances of friendly welcome one of the first to meet him was tommy kavanagh where did you come from phil he asked i am glad enough to see you where are you staying nowhere tommy at present if your mother can take me in i will stay at your house take you yes and will be glad enough to have you stay with us you know we live in a small house but if you dont mind what do you take me for tommy whatever is good enough for you and your mother will be good enough for me what are you doing phil you dont look as if you had hard work making a living i am well fixed now but i have had some anxious days but alls well that ends well i am private secretary to a rich man and live in a fine brownstone house on madison avenue good for you phil i knew youd succeed where is mrs brent has anything been heard from her i dont think anybody in the village knows where she is that is except her cousin who lives in your old house what is his name hugh raynor what sort of a man is he the people in the village dont like him he lives alone and i hear that he cooks for himself he is not at all social and no one feels very much acquainted with him i shall call upon him and inquire after mrs brent then phil you had better go alone for he doesnt like callers and he will be more ready to receive one than two philip enjoyed his visit and was busied making calls on his old acquaintances he was much pleased with the cordiality with which he had been received it was not till the afternoon of the second day that he turned his steps toward the house which had been his home for so long a time we will precede him and explain matters which made his visit very seasonable in the sittingroom sat hugh raynor the present occupant of the house he was a small darkcomplexioned man with a large roman nose and his face was at this moment expressive of discontent this seemed to be connected with a letter which he had just been reading not to keep the reader in suspense it was mailed at chicago and was written by mrs brent we will quote a paragraph you seem to me very unreasonable in expecting me not only to give you the house rentfree but also to give you a salary i would like to know what you do to merit a salary you merely take care of the house as for that there are plenty who would be glad to take charge of so good a house and pay me a fair rent indeed i am thinking that it will be best for me to make some such arrangement especially as you do not seem satisfied with your sinecure position you represent me as rolling in wealth jonas and i are living very comfortably and we have nothing to complain of but that is no reason for my squandering the small fortune left me by my husband i advise you to be a little more reasonable in your demands or i shall request you to leave my house selfish as ever muttered mr raynor after reading this letter over again cousin jane never was willing that any one else should prosper but she has made a mistake in thinking she can treat me meanly i am in a position to turn the tables upon her this paper if she dreamed i had found it she would yield to all my demands he laid his hand upon a paper folded lengthwise and presenting the appearance of a legal document he opened the paper and read aloud to the boy generally known as philip brent and supposed though incorrectly to be my son i bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian to hold in trust for him until he attains the age of twentyone this will mrs brent carefully concealed continued mr raynor in order to save the money for herself and jonas i wonder she was not prudent enough to burn it or at any rate to take it with her when she left planktown it is a damaging secret but i hold it and i mean to use it too let me see what is it best to do mr raynor spent some time in quiet thought it seemed to him that it might be well to hint his discovery in a letter to mrs brent and to make it the basis of a demand for a generous sum of hushmoney one thousand dollars at least he might have decided to do this but for an incident which suggested another course the doorbell rang and when he opened the door with some surprise for callers were few he saw standing before him a tall handsome boy whom he did not recognize do you wish to see me he asked what is your name my name is philip brent what exclaimed mr raynor in visible excitement are you the son of the late mr brent i was always regarded as such answered philip come in then i am glad to see you said mr raynor and phil entered the house surprised at a reception much more cordial than he had expected in that brief moment mr raynor had decided to reveal the secret to phil and trust to his gratitude for a suitable acknowledgment in this way he would revenge himself upon mrs brent who had treated him so meanly i have been wishing to see you for i have a secret of importance to communicate said mr raynor if it relates to my parents i know it already said phil no it is something to your advantage in revealing it i make mrs brent my enemy and shall forfeit the help she is giving me if it is really of advantage to me and i am able to make up your loss to you i will do it said phil that is sufficient i will trust to your honor you look like a boy who will keep a promise though not legally bound you only do me justice mr raynor then cast your eye upon this paper and you will know the secret is it a will exclaimed phil in surprise yes it is the will of the late gerald brent by it he bequeaths to you five thousand dollars then he did not forget me said phil more pleased with the assurance that he had been remembered than by the sum of money bequeathed to him but why have i not known this before he asked looking up from the will you must ask that of mrs brent said mr raynor significantly do you think she suppressed it purposely i do answered raynor laconically i must see her where can i find her i can only say that her letters to me are mailed in chicago but she scrupulously keeps her address a secret then i must go to chicago may i take this paper with me yes i advise you to put it into the hands of a lawyer for safe keeping you will not forget that you are indebted to me for it no mr raynor i will take care you lose nothing by your revelation the next morning phil returned to new york chapter xxxix at the palmer house it may be readily supposed that phils new york friends listened with the greatest attention to his account of what he had learned in his visit to planktown your stepmother is certainly an unscrupulous woman said mr carter doubtless she has left your old town in order to escape accountability to you for your stolen inheritance what puzzles me however is her leaving behind such telltale evidence it is a remarkable oversight do you think she is aware of the existence of the will i think she must be though i hope not answered phil i should like to think that she had not conspired to keep back my share of fathers estate at any rate the first thing to do is evidently to find her out and confront her with the evidence of her crime that is supposing her to be really culpable then you approve of my going to chicago said phil most emphatically nay more i will go with you will you indeed sir said phil joyfully you are very kind i shrank from going alone being a boy ignorant of business a pretty shrewd boy however said mr carter smiling i dont claim much credit however as i have some interests in chicago to which i can attend with advantage personally i am interested in a western railroad the main office of which is in that city when shall we go sir tomorrow answered mr carter promptly the sooner the better you may go down town and procure the necessary tickets and engage sleepingberths here followed the necessary directions which need not be repeated it is enough to say that twentyfour hours later phil and his employer were passengers on a lightning express train bound for chicago they arrived in due season without any adventure worth naming and took rooms at the palmer house now it so happened that in the same hotel at the very same moment were three persons in whom phil was vitally interested these were mrs brent jonas otherwise called philip granville and mr granville himself let me explain their presence in chicago when as we know mr granvilles house was situated at some distance away jonas had preferred a petition to go to chicago for a week in order to attend some of the amusements there to be enjoyed alleging that it was awfully dull in the country mr granville was inclined to be very indulgent to make up for the long years in which he had been compelled practically to desert his son the petition therefore received favor it is only natural that you should wish to see something of the city my son he said i will grant your request we will go to chicago and remain a week at the palmer house mrs brent will you accompany us with pleasure mr granville answered that lady it is not dull here for me still i shall no doubt enjoy a little excitement at any rate i shall be best pleased to be where you and your son are then so let it be we will go tomorrow one secret wish and scheme of mrs brent has not been referred to she felt that her present position was a precarious one she might at any time be found out and then farewell to wealth and luxury but if she could induce mr granville to marry her she would then be secure even if found out and jonas would be the son of mr granville though detected as a usurper she therefore made herself as agreeable as possible to mr granville anticipated his every wish and assumed the character which she did not possess of a gracious and feminine woman of unruffled good humor and sweetness of disposition i say ma jonas observed on one occasion youve improved ever so much since you came here youre a good deal better natured than you were mrs brent smiled but she did not care to take her son into her confidence here i have no cares to trouble me she said i live here in a way that suits me but when they were about starting for chicago mrs brent felt herself becoming unaccountably depressed jonas she said i am sorry we are going to chicago why ma well have a splendid time i feel as if some misfortune were impending over us said his mother and she shivered apprehensively but it was too late to recede besides jonas wished to go and she had no good reason to allege for breaking the arrangement chapter xl a scene not on the bills phil was in chicago but that was only the first step toward finding those of whom he was in search had he been sure that they were in the city it would have simplified matters but the fact that mrs brent directed her letters to be sent to that city proved nothing it did not make it certain that she lived in the town we are only at the beginning of our perplexities philip said mr carter your friends may be near us or they may be a hundred miles away that is true sir one method of finding them is barred that of advertising since they undoubtedly do not care to be found and an advertisement would only place them on their guard what would you advise sir we might employ a detective to watch the postoffice but here again there might be disappointment mrs brent might employ a third person to call for her letters however i have faith to believe that sooner or later we shall find her time and patience accomplishes much were you ever a detective sir asked phil smiling no philip but i have had occasion to employ them now how would you like to go to the theater this evening very much sir there is a good play running at mcvickers theatre we will go there anywhere will suit me mr carter young people are easily satisfied he said when they get older they get more fastidious however there is generally something attractive at mcvickers it so happened that philip and his employer took a late dinner and did not reach the theater till ten minutes after the hour they had seats in the seventh row of orchestra chairs a very eligible portion of the house the curtain had risen and philips attention was given to the stage till the end of the first act then he began to look around him suddenly he started and half rose from his seat what is the matter philip asked mr carter there sir look there said the boy in excitement pointing to two persons in the fourth row in front do you recognize acquaintances philip it is my stepmother and jonas answered philip eagerly it is indeed wonderful said mr carter sharing the boys excitement you are confident are you oh sir i couldnt be mistaken about that just then mrs brent turned to a gentleman at her side and spoke it was mr granville who is that gentleman said mr carter reflectively do you think mrs brent is married again i dont know what to think said philip bewildered i will tell you what to do you cannot allow these people to elude you go to the hotel ask a direction to the nearest detective office have a man detailed to come here directly and let him find if necessary where your stepmother and her son are living philip did so and it was the close of the second act before he returned with him was a small quiet gentleman of unpretending appearance but skilled as a detective now continued mr carter you may venture at any time to go forward and speak to your friends if they can be called such i dont think they can sir i wont go till the last intermission phil was forestalled however at the close of the fourth act jonas happened to look back and his glance fell upon philip a scared dismayed look was on his face as he clutched his mothers arm and whispered ma philip is sitting just back of us mrs brents heart almost ceased to beat she saw that the moment of exposure was probably at hand with pale face she whispered has he seen us he is looking right at us she had time to say no more philip left his seat and coming forward approached the seat of his stepmother how do you do mrs brent he said she stared at him but did not speak how are you jonas continued our hero my name isnt jonas muttered the boy addressed mr granville meanwhile had been eagerly looking at philip there appeared to be something in his appearance which riveted the attention of the beholder was it the voice of nature which spoke from the striking face of the boy you have made a mistake boy said mrs brent summoning all her nerve i am not the lady you mention and this boy does not bear the name of jonas what is his name then demanded philip my name is philip granville answered jonas quickly is it then it has changed suddenly answered phil in a sarcastic voice six months ago when we were all living at planktown your name was jonas webb you must be a lunatic said mrs brent with audacious falsehood my own name is philip as you very well know your name philip exclaimed mr granville with an excitement which he found it hard to control yes sir the lady is my stepmother and this boy is her son jonas and you whose son are you gasped mr granville i dont know sir i was left at an early age at a hotel kept by this ladys husband by my father who never returned then you must be my son said mr granville you and not this boy you sir did you leave me i left my son with mr brent this lady led me to believe that the boy at my side was my son here then was a sudden and startling occurrence mrs brent fainted the strain had been too much for her nerves strong as they were of course she must be attended to come with me i cannot lose sight of you now my son said mr granville where are you staying at the palmer house so am i will you be kind enough to order a carriage mrs brent was conveyed to the hotel and jonas followed sullenly of course philip mr granville and mr carter left the theater later the last three held a conference in the parlor it took little to convince mr granville that philip was his son i am overjoyed he said i have never been able to feel toward the boy whom you call jonas as a father should he was very distasteful to me it was an extraordinary deception on the part of mrs brent said mr carter thoughtfully she is a very unprincipled woman said mr granville even now that matters have come right i find it hard to forgive her you do not know all the harm she has sought to do your son the sum of five thousand dollars was left him by mr brent and she suppressed the will good heavens is this true we have the evidence of it the next day an important interview was held at the palmer house mrs brent was forced to acknowledge the imposition she had practiced upon mr granville what could induce you to enter into such a wicked conspiracy asked mr granville shocked the temptation was strong i wished to make my son rich besides i hated philip it is well your wicked plan has been defeated it might have marred my happiness forever what are you going to do with me she asked coolly but not without anxiety it was finally settled that the matter should be hushed up philip wished to give up the sum bequeathed him by mr brent but to this mr granville objected feeling that it would constitute a premium on fraud besides mrs brent would have the residue of the estate amounting to nearly ten thousand dollars being allowed to do what he chose with this money he gave it in equal portions to tommy kavanagh and mr raynor who had informed him of the existence of mr brents will mrs brent decided not to go back to planktown she judged that the story of her wickedness would reach that village and make it disagreeable for her she opened a small millinery store in chicago and is doing fairly well but jonas is her chief trouble as he is lazy and addicted to intemperate habits his chances of success and an honorable career are small how can i spare you philip said mr carter regretfully i know your father has the best right to you but i dont like to give you up you need not said mr granville i propose to remove to new york but in the summer i shall come to my estate near chicago and hope since the house is large enough that i may persuade you and your niece mrs forbush to be my guests this arrangement was carried out mrs forbush and her daughter are the recognized heirs of mr carter who is wholly estranged from the pitkins he ascertained through a detective that the attack upon philip by the man who stole from him the roll of bills was privately instigated by mr pitkin himself in the hope of getting philip into trouble mr carter thereupon withdrew his capital from the firm and mr pitkin is generally supposed to be on the verge of bankruptcy at any rate his credit is very poor and there is a chance that the pitkins may be reduced to comparative poverty i wont let lavinia suffer said uncle oliver if the worst comes to the worst i will settle a small income say twelve hundred dollars on her but we can never be friends as phil grew older he is now twentyone it seems probable that he and mr carter may be more closely connected judging from his gallant attentions to julia forbush who has developed into a charming young lady nothing would suit mr carter better for there is no one who stands higher in his regard than philip granville the errand boy fred sargents revenge fred sargent upon this day from which my story dates went to the head of his latin class in the high school of andrewsville the school was a fine one the teachers strict the classes large the boys generally gentlemanly and the moral tone pervading the whole of the very best character to lead a class in a school like this was an honor of which any boy might have been proud and fred when he heard his name read off at the head of the roll could have thrown up his wellworn latin grammar which he happened to have in his hand just at that moment and hurrahed it was quite a wonder to him afterward that he did not as a class boys are supposed to be generous i really dont know whether they deserve to be considered so or not but some four or five only in this large school envied fred the rest would probably have hurrahed with him for fred was a capital good fellow and quite a favorite bully for you whispered ned brown his righthand neighbor but ned was instantly disgraced the eye of the teacher catching the words as they dropped from his lips when school was over several of the boys rushed to the spot where fred his cap in his hand and his dark hair blowing about every way was standing i say said james duncan i thought you would get it youve worked like a trojan and you deserve it its as good as getting the valedictory said joe stone and that is entering into any college in the land without an examination said peter crane now peter had run shoulder to shoulder with fred and it does him great credit that being beaten he was thoroughly goodnatured about it i say fred you ought to treat for this and noah holmes standing on tiptoe looked over the heads of the other boys significantly at fred i wish i could but heres all the money ive got said fred taking about twentyfive cents from his pocket all that was left of his monthly allowance thats better than nothing it will buy an apple apiece come on lets go down to old grangers i saw some apples there big as your head and bigger too said noah with a droll wink well come on then and away went the boys at freds heels pushing and shouting laughing and frolicking until they came to abel grangers little grocery now hush up you fellows said noah turning round upon them let fred go in by himself old grange cant abide a crowd and noise it will make him cross and all we shall get will be the specked and wormeaten ones come fall back there very quietly and obediently the boys who always knew their leader fell back and fred went into the little dark grocery alone he was so pleasant and gentlemanly that let him go where he would and do what he would in some mysterious way he always found the right side of people and got what he wanted in the most satisfactory manner now abel granger was as cross as a meat axe noah said and all the boys were afraid of him if the apples had been anywhere else they would have been much surer of their treat but in spite of their fears back came fred in a few moments with a heaping measure of nice red apples apples that made the boys mouths water fred said that old abel had given him as near a smile as could come to his yellow wrinkled face treat em he said treat em eh wal now pears likely theyd eat you out of house and home i never see a boy yet that couldnt go through a tenpenny nail easy as not we are always hungry i believe said fred allers allers thats a fact picking out the best apples as he spoke and heaping up the measure there now if youll find a better lot than that for the money you are welcome to it thats all couldnt do it thank you very much said fred as the boys took the apples eagerly and began to bite them they saw the old face looking out of the dirty panes of window glass upon them fred loved to make everybody happy around him and this treating was only second best to leading his class so when at the corner of the street turning to his fathers house he parted from his young companions i doubt whether there was a happier boy in all andrewsville i do not think we shall blame him very much if he unconsciously carried his head pretty high and looked proudly happy out from under the low archway leading to bill crandons house a boy about as tall as fred but stout and coarse in ragged clothes stood staring up and down the street as fred came toward him something in freds looks and manner seemed especially to displease him he moved directly into the middle of the sidewalk and squared himself as if for a fight there was no other boy in town whom fred disliked so much and of whom he felt so afraid sam crandon everybody knew was a bully he treated boys who were larger and stronger than himself civilly but was cruel and domineering over the poor and weak so far in his life though they met often fred had avoided coming into contact with sam and sam had seemed to feel just a little awe of him for mr sargent was one of the wealthiest leading men in town and sam in spite of himself found something in the handsome gentlemanly boy that held him in check but today sams father had just beaten him and the boy was smarting from the blows i dare say he was hungry and uncomfortable from many other causes but however this may have been he felt in the mood for making trouble for seeing somebody else unhappy beside himself this prosperous welldressed boy with his books under his arm and his happy face was the first person he had come across and here then was his opportunity fred saw him assume the attitude of a prize fighter and knew what it meant sam had a cut red and swollen across one cheek and this helped to make his unpleasant face more ugly and lowering than usual what was to be done to turn and run never occurred to fred to meet him and fight it out was equally impossible so fred stopped and looked at him irresolutely youre afraid of a licking asked sam grinning ominously i dont want to fight said fred quietly no more you dont but youve got to freds blood began to rise the words and looks of the rough boy were a little too much for his temper move out of the way he said walking directly up to him sam hesitated for a moment the steady honest bold look in freds eyes was far more effective than a blow would have been but as soon as fred had passed him he turned and struck him a quick stinging blow between his shoulders thats mean said fred wheeling round strike fair and in front if you want to but dont hit in the back thats a cowards trick take it there then said sam aiming a heavy blow at freds breast but the latter skillfully raised his books and sams knuckles were the worse for the encounter hurt did it said fred laughing what if it did say quits then not by a good deal and in spite of himself fred was dragged into an ignominious street fight oh how grieved and mortified he was when his father coming down the street saw and called to him hearing his voice sam ran away and fred bruised and smarting with his books torn and his clothes too went over to his father not a word did mr sargent say he took freds hand in his and the two walked silently to their home i doubt whether mr sargent was acting wisely fred never had told him an untruth in his life and a few words now might have set matters right but to this roughness in boys mr sargent had a special aversion he had so often taken pains to instill its impropriety and vulgarity into freds mind that he could not now imagine an excuse he should not have done so under any circumstances said his father sternly to himself i am both surprised and shocked and the punishment must be severe unfortunately for fred his mother was out of town for a few days a mother so much sooner than a father reaches the heart of her son so now his father said you will keep your room for the next week i shall send your excuse to your teacher ellen will bring your meals to you at the end of that time i will see and talk with you without a word fred hung his cap upon its nail and went to his room such a sudden change from success and elation to shame and condign punishment was too much for him he felt confused and bewildered things looked dark around him and the great boughs of the norway spruce close up by his window nodded and winked at him in a very odd way he had been often reproved and sometimes had received a slight punishment but never anything like this and now he felt innocent or rather at first he did not feel at all everything was so strange and unreal he heard ellen come into his room after a few minutes with his dinner but he did not turn a cold numbing sense of disgrace crept over him he felt as if even before this irish girl he could never hold up his head again he did not wish to eat or do anything what could it all mean slowly the whole position in which he was placed came to him the boys gathering at school the surprise with which his absence would be noted the lost honor so lately won his fathers sad grave face his sisters unhappiness his mothers sorrow and even sams face so ugly in its triumph all were there what an afternoon that was how slowly the long hours dragged themselves away and yet until dusk fred bore up bravely then he leaned his head on his hands tired hungry worn out with sorrow he burst into tears and cried like a baby dont blame him i think any one of us would have done the same oh mother mother said fred aloud to himself do come home do come home ellen looked very sympathizing when she came in with his tea and found his dinner untouched eat your tea master fred she said gently the like of ye cant go without your victuals no way i dont know what youve done but i aint afeared there is any great harm in it though your collar is on crooked and theres a tear in your jacket to say nothing of a black and blue place under your left eye but eat your tea heres some fruit cake biddy sent o purpose somebody did think of and feel sorry for him fred felt comforted on the instant by ellens kind words and biddys plum cake and i must say ate a hearty hungry boys supper then went to bed and slept soundly until late the next morning we have not space to follow fred through the tediousness of the following week his father strictly carried out the punishment to the letter no one came near him but ellen though he heard the voices of his sisters and the usual happy home sounds constantly about him had fred really been guilty even in the matter of a street fight he would have been the unhappiest boy living during this time but we know he was not so we shall be glad to hear that with his books and the usual medley of playthings with which a boys room is piled he contrived to make the time pass without being very wretched it was the disgrace of being punished the lost position in school and above all the triumph which it would be to sam which made him the most miserable the very injustice of the thing was its balm in this case may it be so my young readers with any punishment which may ever happen to you all these things however were opening the way to make freds revenge when it came the more complete fred sargent of course had lost his place and was subjected to a great many curious inquiries when he returned to school he had done his best in his room to keep up with his class but his books studied in prison as he had learned to call it and in the sittingroom with his sister nellie and his mother to help him were very different things still doing your best always brings its reward and let me say in passing before the close of the month fred had won his place again this was more easily done than satisfying the kind inquiries of the boys so after trying the first day to evade them fred made a clean breast of it and told the whole story i think perhaps mr sargents severe and unjust discipline had a far better effect upon the boys generally than upon fred particularly they did not know how entirely fred had acted on the defensive and so they received a lesson which most of them never forgot on the importance which a kind genial man with a smile and a cheery word for every child in town attached to brawling after all the worst effect of this punishment came upon sam crandon himself very much disliked as his wicked ways had made him before he was now considered as a town nuisance everybody avoided him and when forced to speak to him did so in the coldest and often in the most unkind manner sam not three weeks after his wanton assault upon fred was guilty of his first theft and of drinking his first glass of liquor in short he was going headlong to destruction and no one seemed to think him worth the saving skulking by day prowling by night hungry dirty beaten and sworn at no wonder that he seemed godforsaken as well as manforsaken mr sargent had a large store in rutgers street he was a wholesale dealer in iron ware and andrewsville was such an honest quiet town ordinary means were not taken to keep the goods from the hands of thieves back doors side doors and front doors stood open all the day and no one went in or out but those who had dealings with the firm suddenly however articles began to be missed a package of knives a bolt a hatchet an axe a pair of skates flatirons knives and forks indeed hardly a day passed without a new thing being taken and though every clerk in the store was on the alert and very watchful still the thief or thieves remained undetected at last matters grew very serious it was not so much the pecuniary value of the losses that was never large but the uncertainty into which it threw mr sargent the dishonest person might be one of his own trusted clerks such things had happened and sad to say probably would again fred said his father one saturday afternoon i should like to have you come down to the store and watch in one of the rooms there is a great run of business today and the clerks have their hands more than full i must find out if possible who it is that is stealing so freely yesterday i lost six pearlhandled knives worth two dollars apiece can you come yes sir said fred promptly i will be there at one to a minute and if i catch him let him look out sharp that is all this acting as police officer was new business to fred and made him feel very important so when the town clock was on the stroke of one he entered the store and began his patrol it was fun for the first hour and he was so much on the alert that old mr stone from his high stool before the desk had frequently to put his pen behind his ear and watch him it was quite a scene in a play to see how fred would start at the least sound a mouse nibbling behind a box of iron chains made him beside himself until he had scared the little gray thing from its hole and saw it scamper away out of the shop but after the first hour the watching for nothing became a little tedious there was a splendid game of base ball to come off on the public green that afternoon and after that the boys were going to the shawseen for a swim then there was to be a picnic on the indian ridge and well fred had thought of all these losses when he so pleasantly assented to his fathers request and he was not going to complain now he sat down on a box and commenced drumming tunes with his heels on its sides this disturbed mr stone he looked at him sharply so he stopped and sauntered out into a corner of the back store where there was a trapdoor leading down into the water a small river ran by under the end of the store also by the depot which was near at hand and his father used to have some of his goods brought down in boats and hoisted up through this door it was always one of the most interesting places in the store to fred he liked to sit with his feet hanging down over the water watching it as it came in and dashed against the cellar walls today it was high and a smart breeze drove it in with unusual force bending down as far as he could safely to look under the store fred saw the end of a hatchet sticking out from the corner of one of the abutments that projected from the cellar to support the end of the store in which the trapdoor was what a curious place this is for a hatchet thought fred as he stooped a little further holding on very tight to the floor above what he saw made him almost lose his hold and drop into the water below there stretched along on a beam was sam crandon with some stolen packages near him for a moment freds astonishment was too great to allow him to speak and sam glared at him like a wild beast brought suddenly to bay oh sam sam said fred at length how could you sam caught up a hatchet and looked as if he was going to aim it at him then suddenly dropped it into the water freds heart beat fast and the blood came and went from his cheeks he caught his breath heavily and the water the abutment and even sam with his wicked ugly face were for a moment darkened then recovering himself he said was it you sam im sorry for you dont lie said sam glowering back you know youre glad glad why should i be glad to have you steal cause i licked you and you caught it so i did but i am sorry for all that you lie fred had thought very fast while this conversation was going on he had only to lift his head and call his father then the boat would be immediately pushed in under the store sam secured and his punishment certain there were stolen goods enough to convict him and his mode of ingress into the store was now certain this trapdoor was never locked very often it was left open the water being considered the most effectual bolt and bar that could be used but sam a good swimmer and climber had come in without difficulty and had quite a store of his own hidden away there for future use this course was very plain but for some reason which fred could not explain even to himself he did not feel inclined to take it so he sat looking steadily in sams face until he said look here sam i want to show you i mean what i say im sorry you have turned thief and if i can help you to be a better boy i should be glad to again freds honest kindly face had the same effect upon sam that it had at the commencement of their street fight he respected and trusted it unconsciously here said he crawling along on the beam and handing back the package of knives the last theft of which his father had complained yes that is right said fred leaning down and taking it give them all back if you can that is what my father calls making restitution and then you wont be a thief any longer something in the boys tone touched sams heart still more so he handed back one thing after another as rapidly as he could until nearly everything was restored bravo for you sam i wont tell who took them and there is a chance for you here give me your hand now honor bright youll never come here again to steal if i dont tell my father sam looked at him a moment as if he would read his very soul then he said sulkily youll tell i know you will cause i licked you when you didnt want me to but youve got em all back and i spose it wont go very hard what wont go very hard the prison you shant go to prison at all here give me your hand i promise not to tell if you will promise not to steal any more aint that fair yes said sam a sudden change coming over his face but you will try me and see sam slowly and really at a great deal of peril considering his situation put his rough grimed hand into freds a dishonest hand it was and that more than the other thing made fred recoil a little as he touched it but that clasp sealed the compact between these two boys it began fred sargents revenge now be off will you before the clerks come they will see the things and catch you here ill be round to your house soon and we will see even in this short time fred had formed a general plan for saving sam the boy stretching himself out flat slipped down the transverse beam into the water dived at once and came up under the bridge a few rods distant then coolly passed down the river and swam to shore under a bunch of alderbushes by which he was concealed from the sight of the passersby fred sought his father told him the story then brought him to the spot showed the goods which the boy had returned and begged as a reward for the discovery to be allowed to conceal his name his father of course hesitated at so unusual a proposition but there was something so very much in earnest in all fred did and said that he became convinced it was best for the present at least to allow him to have his own way and this he was very glad he had done when a few days after fred asked him to do something for sam crandon sam crandon he asked in surprise is not that the very boy i found you fighting in the street with yes sir said fred hanging his head but he promises to do well if he can only find work honest work you see sir he is so bad nobody helps him mr sargent smiled a strange recommendation fred he said but i will try what can be done a boy who wants to reform should have a helping hand he does want to he wants to heartily he says he does father if you only will fred as he stood there his whole face lit up with the glow of this generous noble emotion never was dearer to his fathers heart indeed his fathers eyes were dim and his voice a little husky as he said again i will look after him fred for your sake and so he did but where and how i have not space now to tell my readers perhaps at some future time i may finish this story for the present let me say there is a new boy in mr sargents store with rough coarse face voice and manners everybody wonders at seeing him there everybody prophesies future trouble but nobody knows that this step up in sam crandons life is fred sargents revenge the smugglers trap hubert had accompanied his father on a visit to his uncle who lived in a fine old country mansion on the shore of caermarthen bay in front of the house spread a long beach which terminated in precipitous cliffs and rocky ledges on the afternoon of the day following his arrival he declared his intention of exploring the beach dont get caught in the smugglers trap said his uncle as he mentioned his plan the smugglers trap yes its at the end of the beach where you see the cliffs its a hollow cave which you can only walk at very low tide youd better not go in there oh never fear said hubert carelessly and in a few minutes he was wandering over the beach and after walking about two miles reached the end of the beach at the base of the great cliffs the precipice towered frowningly overhead its base all worn and furrowed by the furious surges that for ages had dashed against it all around lay a chaos of huge boulders covered with seaweed the tide was now at the lowest ebb the surf here was moderate for the seaweed on the rocks interfered with the swell of the waters and the waves broke outside at some distance between the base of the precipice and the edge of the water there was a space left dry by the ebb tide about two yards in width and hubert walked forward over the space thus uncovered to see what lay before him he soon found himself in a place which seemed like a fissure rent in a mountain side by some extraordinary convulsion of nature all around rose black precipitous cliffs on the side nearest was the precipice by whose base he had passed while over opposite was a gigantic wall of dark rock which extended far out into the sea huge waves thundered at its feet and dashed their spray far upward into the air the space was about fifty yards across the fissure extended back for about two hundred yards and there terminated in a sharp angle formed by the abrupt walls of the cliffs which enclosed it all around there were caverns worn into the base of the precipices by the action of the sea the floor of this place was gravelly but near the water it was strewn with large boulders further in there were no boulders and it was easy to walk about at the furthest extremity there was a flat rock that seemed to have fallen from the cliff above in some former age the cliffs around were about two hundred feet in height they were perfectly bare and intensely black on their stormriven summits not a sign of verdure appeared everything had the aspect of gloom which was heightened by the mournful monotone of the sea waves as they dashed against the rock after the first feeling of awe had passed hubert ran forward leaping from rock to rock till he came to where the beach or floor of the fissure was gravelly over this he walked and hastened to the caverns looking into them one after another then he busied himself by searching among the pebbles for curious stones and shells he found here numerous specimens of the rarest and finest treasures of the sea shells of a delicacy of tint and perfection of outline seaweeds of new and exquisite forms with rich hues which he had hitherto believed impossible in the hollows of the rocks where the water yet lay in pools he found little minnows and delicate jelly fish with their long slender fibers and sea anemones and sea urchins with their spires extended and starfish moving about with their innumerable creepers it was a new world a world which had thus far been only visible to him in the aquarium and now as it stood before him he forgot all else he did not feel the wind as it blew in fresh from the sea the dread souwester the terror of fishermen he did not notice the waves that rolled in more furiously from without and were now beginning to break in wrath upon the rocky ledges and boulders he did not see that the water had crept on nearer to the cliff and that a white line of foam now lay on that narrow belt of beach which he had traversed at the foot of the cliff suddenly a sound burst upon his ears that roused him and sent all the blood back to his heart it was his own name called out in a voice of anguish and almost of despair by his father he sprang to his feet started forward and rushed with the speed of the wind to the place by which he had entered the enclosure but a barrier lay before him the rolling waves were there rushing in over the rocks dashing against the cliff tossing their white and quivering spray exulting in the air at once hubert knew his danger he was caught in the smugglers trap and the full meaning of his uncles warning flashed upon his mind as in his terror he shrieked back to his father then there was silence for a time while hubert had been in the trap his father and uncle had been walking along the beach and the former heard for the first time the nature and danger of the smugglers trap he was at once filled with anxiety about his son and had hurried to the place to call him back when to his horror he found that the tide had already covered the only way by which the dangerous place might be approached no sooner had he heard huberts answering cry than he rushed forward to try and save him but the next moment a great wave came rolling in and dashed him upon the cliff terribly bruised he clung to the cliff till the surf fell back and then ran on again he slipped over a rock and fell but instantly regaining his feet he advanced further and in his haste fell into a hollow which was filled with water before he could emerge another wave was upon him this one beat him down and it was only by clinging to the seaweed that he escaped being sucked back by the retreating surge bold and frenzied though he was he had to start back from the fury of such an assault as this he rushed backward and waited his eyes searched wildly around he noticed that the surf grew more violent every moment and every moment took away hope but he would not yield once more he rushed forward the waves rolled in but he grasped the rocks and withstood the surf and still advanced another followed he bowed before it and clinging to the rocks as before came forth triumphant already he was nearly halfway he sprang upon a rock that rose above the level of the seething flood and stood for a moment panting and gasping but now a great wave came rolling in upon him he fell on his knees and clung to the seaweed the wave struck it hurled him from the rock he rolled over and over blinded bruised and half drowned he felt himself dashed against the cliff he threw his arms wildly about but found nothing which he could seize the retreating wave sucked him back but a rock stayed him this he grasped and was saved then hastily scrambling to his feet he staggered back to the place from which he had started before he could get back another wave threw him down and this time he might have been drowned had not his brother plunged in and dragged him out of all this hubert had seen nothing and known nothing he waited for some time in silence and then called there was no answer he called again and again but at that time his father was struggling with the waves and did not hear him at last after what seemed an interminable time he heard once more his fathers voice he shouted back dont be afraid cried the voice ill get you out wait and then there were no more voices it was about two oclock when hubert had entered the gorge it was after three when his father had roused him and made his vain effort to save him hubert was now left alone with the rising tide whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity the beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters he tried to trust to his fathers promise but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm for every moment the wind grew fiercer and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity he looked all around for a place of refuge and saw nothing except the rock which arose at the extremity of the place at the foot of the overhanging cliffs it was about five feet high and was the only place that afforded anything like safety up this he clambered and from this he could survey the scene but only to perceive the full extent of his danger for the tide rushed in more and more swiftly the surf grew higher and higher and he saw plainly that before long the water would reach the summit of the rock and that even before then the surf in its violence would sweep him away the moments passed slowly minutes seemed in his suspense to be transformed to hours the sky was overspread now with black clouds and the gloom increased at length the waves rolled in until they covered all the beach in front and began to dash against the rock on which he had taken refuge the precious moments passed higher and higher grew the waters they came rolling into the cave urged on by the fury of the billows outside and heaping themselves up as they were compressed into this narrow gorge they dashed up around the rock the spray was tossed in his face already he felt their inexorable grasp death seemed so near that hope left him he fell upon his knees with his hands clasped and his white face upturned just then a great wave rolled up and flung itself over the rock and over his knees as he knelt and over his hands as he clasped them in prayer a few more moments and all would be over as hope left a calmness came the calmness that is born of despair face to face with death he had tasted the bitterness of death but now he flung aside the agony of his fear and rose to his feet and his soul prepared itself for the end just then in the midst of the uproar of wind and wave there came a sudden sound which roused to quick feverish throbs the young lads heart it was a voice and sounded just above him hubert he looked up there far above him in the gloom he saw faces projecting over the edge of the cliff the cry came again he recognized the voice of his father for a moment hubert could not speak hope returned he threw up his arms wildly and cried make haste oh make haste a rope was made fast about huberts father and he was let down over the edge of the cliff he would allow no other than himself to undertake this journey he had hurried away and gathered a number of fishermen whose stout arms and sinewy hands now held the rope by which he descended to save his son it was a perilous journey the wind blew and the rope swayed more and more as it was let down and sometimes he was dashed against the rocky sides of the precipice but still he descended and at last stood on the rock and clasped his son in his arms but there was no time to lose hubert mounted on his fathers shoulders holding the rope while his father bound his boy close to him then the word was given and they were slowly pulled up they reached the summit in safety and as they reached it those who looked down through the gloom saw the white foam of the surf as it boiled in fury over the rock where hubert had been standing
