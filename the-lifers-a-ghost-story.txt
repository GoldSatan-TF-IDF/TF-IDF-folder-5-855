the lifers edgar million the lifers a ghost story there are different rules for nighttime tribes night work pays well but messes with my body clock no end so even on days when not on shift i find myself up and alert at all hours staring into walls drinking disgusting cups of frothy ovaltine mum offers me one of her sleeping pills sometimes but i dont like the deathly sleep which accompanies them like being sealed in concrete i settle for restlessness each summer and winter when ive come home from school i have taken on some sort of night shift as it allows me to write in peace in my spare moments and this was maybe the fourth or fifth time ive signed up this summer will be the last time after what she told me i dont know if i feel safe anymore the shifting hours always shuffle my sense of reality but the camaraderie of my previous postings usually made up for it the nights were fun peppered with enjoyable incident like the time it started to snow outside the window and jake the night shift manager a human labrador of a man had the idea to open a window grab handfuls of snow which were heaped on the window sill and to start throwing snowballs inside the office launching an allout indoor snow fight trying to hit each other but miss the computers or heading off at am to an allnight bar to drink shots until noon blearily watching the rest of the world outside the window greyly making their way into their working days there was none of that in my new posting from the first night at grewtech the climate was different the room where the small call centre sat could have employed a hundred telephone operatives did so during the day i was told in my interview although i never saw this exiled as i was to the darkness our four desks sat in a brightly lit pod at the heart of the darkened office the uninhabited work spaces surrounding us like a shadow of the daytime world traces of those other people surrounded us in the shadows halfdrunk cups of coffee adorned with the company logo photos of gurning children whose parents we exiles would never encounter and sometimes i would fool myself into thinking figures lurked just out of sight witnessing our toil the lights throughout the building were motion sensor controlled and as you entered the blackness of the room it split open around you in a manner reminiscent of being tracked onstage by a spotlight the lights behind you quickly dimming as you pass if you sit still enough for long enough at your desk you find yourself consumed by complete darkness and need to wave a hand to activate the sensors and reignite the oscillating cubes strip lighting dotted across the grey speckled ceiling above from a distance we resemble an island of people in the darkness a bleak cold white spot this is how i perceive it now though i admit my memory may be colored by everything else by stories heard in the darkness but no from the very first it seemed to go wrong something seemed to be wrong in this place arriving at pm seven to seven being my allotted hours six days on and four days off i used the pass id been given at my interview to enter through the side door the flashy looking glass and chrome revolving entrance reserved for those in possession of proper levels of vitamin d the manager tom a lanky crop headed man whod interviewed me wearing a grey nylon shirt which was just beginning to strain under the stirrings of a middle aged paunch had been meant to meet me for the first hour of the first night just the first night to show me the ropes as it were but as i arrived i felt the tremor of a new text message in my handbag so with a tale of a sick child a temperature unchecked by infant tylenol i made my way up alone clutching my entry fob and a makeshift identity pass handed to me by the elderly security guard mickey an ancient greasy man who lunged in to gawp unashamedly down the my top as he handed me the entry card the faint odor of menthol fogging him and clogging my nostrils mickey grinned at me lecherous a broken smile with teeth like wellspaced gravestones along a crooked church path then he eased back into a crimson office chair never once taking his eyes from my chest i resolved to ensure i wore heavy jumpers and coats when i passed him in future creep the interior of the elevator was wood panelled and claustrophobic with room for no more than three or four normally proportioned people even on my own i felt as though i should hold my breath or risk draining the space of oxygen before reaching my destination there was another lift for daytime use but this was deactivated at night to save money or energy or something so the ancient coffin space was my only option juddering and shuddering as it went up or down each time entered i wondered if this would be the night when it would finally trap me in the unreachable darkness they were already there when i arrived that first night would always be there as i stepped out onto the carpet tiled office floor my new colleagues would always be there waiting for me always early always ready to go seated expectantly well before the lines switched from the daytime service to ours opening the door on that first night i observed the island of light in the cold blackness three people seated around a pod of desks built for four for a moment i had the feeling they waited for the one who would complete them but they would soon disavow me of this illusion the path ahead of my lit as i approached then disappeared in my wake as i felt buffeted by a blast of cold my skin electrified by the chill and i searched the ceiling in search of the malfunctioning air con unit my new coworkers peered at me grimly over the low level dividers around their desks and i found myself directed to the spare desk with a grunt the eldest of the company handing me an instruction manual which would be the full extent of any training i was to receive that or any night and a tatty bluetooth headset which i set about cleaning with alcohol scented screenwipes until it was vaguely tolerable then inserted it into my ear momentarily cold and wet as it touched my ear canal i pressed the button on the black tower of my oldnew pc and my fingers tingled at the slight hum of the machine awakening while i waited for it to complete its stirrings i tried to familiarize myself with my new surroundings all the time closely examined by my mute colleagues one a manboy a little older than myself maybe twenty three or four his chubby face too old to still be able to be described as having puppy fat just gaped at me lewdly over the top of his monitor discreetly ogling me which i supposed was an improvement on the security guard downstairs while the female member of their troupe a small eyed round faced woman in her fifties overweight and misshapen with skin which had been so ravaged by acne in her youth that it now resembled the surface of the moon leant over and whispered something into the ear of the eldest member of the group a sallow faced man in a crumpled dark green suit with thinning hair waxed back across his forehead he could have been thirty or sixty but i didnt like to ask my guess was the latter i imagined hed been there forever in the same suit the life being sucked out of him leaving only this yellow shiny thin haired stain of a man we were the night shift tech support line for an electronics company and the training was minimal since we were primarily telling people how to turn on their new tablets and phones either that or telling drunk teenagers who had hit the help button on their gadget to bugger off and stop prankcalling us i spoke to people from all over the country and explained to them how to use their new toys but if id expected to be welcomed into the call centre fold then soon enough id be disappointed the other three the lifers as i came to think of them mutely went about their tasks muttering to each other and occasionally giving me dirty looks ignoring my efforts at small talk and blankly gawking at me the office space remained icy cold and when i asked if there were any heaters we could use todd he of the green suit and yellow skin told me they werent allowed health and safety darlin he drawled scornfully then looking pointedly at my chest stick a sweater on tomorrow manboy real name steve nodded in agreement and grinned whilst moonface irene just scowled and i selfconsciously pulled the sides of my top together but somehow felt more naked under their gaze health and safety i responded might want to take a look at this headset i told them and that lift its a deathtrap poor little you manboy spat is there anything good in your life you mean apart from the warmth im in the glow of from my friendly new coworkers then deciding a conciliatory tone might be more appropriate i tried again do you like working the night shift then more scowls a lengthy pause then moonface responded that at least it kept her from being in bed with some man called dek or deck or deek who i assumed was her husband or boyfriend a despicable man i was to learn night by night at least by moonfaces standards i reckoned this accommodation was mutually agreeable to both parties i couldnt imagine waking to the unpainted version of her uneven mug would be anything except terrifying but i kept this thought to myself manboy and yellow just continued staring at me early on i realized the lifers were a closed club a union of fools so i withdrew from their company and concentrated on the callers there would be two or three months of this max then i could leave them to their ongoing misery good riddance and all that most of our calls were from insomniacs and drunks or late night pervs trying to take the adult content lock off but at least they talked to me voices in the darkness beaming all the way across america just to speak to me not like the lifers silently judging me lonely night owls calling into the darkness i even started to get regulars and they made the night bearable a guy called barry from michigan who was unashamedly obsessed by pornography featuring soccer moms but who was friendly and nonthreatening and may a fiftysomething homemaker down in maine googling cookery tips and uses for vinegar as a cleaning agent doesnt your house just end up smelling of vinegar i asked her indeed it does honey she laughed and tonight im looking for something to get rid of the darned smell she gave me cleaning tips which i told her id pass on to mom and described a darling grandson who she only gets to see about once a year thanks to her errant sons onoff relationship with the mother of the bright faced child these calls cheered me somewhat helped me to ignore them one girl phoned almost every night just asking me how i was getting on the calls are free for them of course but she said she was from newark which is just down the road and each time shed goes on about how she just loves these gadgets and technology she didnt really want advice so wed talk about the on little tweaks and tricks hidden within the devices half the time she knew more than me every time you think this is the best thing youve ever seen they manage to come up with something new totally fetch her voice was there every night waiting for me cassandra cassie later shed admit she was calling mostly because she was lonely but in the beginning she tried to maintain a light breezy air it take long before she began to open up i feel i can really talk to you you really hear me you should be a shrink or something you hear me in the night she told me she felt disconnected set adrift by those who had tormented and done her wrong who had mistreated her the night didnt allow her sleep so she stalked the darkness and stewed about what they had done to her it was nice to have a friendly voice to speak to though she told me there were lots of cassies out there from across the continent their voices drifted to me some nights i felt more like the samaritans than tech support but mostly it was okay teaching technophobes how to download songs or use youtube and hearing the slight cheer in her voice as cassie connected hi cassie would begin brightly busy night not so much i told her even the insomniacs go off to sleep on slow tuesday nights not me she responded i never sleep never i asked you have to sleep sometimes though maybe you just dont notice must feel horrible im a night owl but i sleep well enough during the day i never sleep she said again then added not since not since it happened since what happened i hesitated to ask this at risk of obtaining a little too much insight into the life of someone i barely knew but she simply responded that she didnt like to talk about not yet anyway a man i figured or a boy pretending to be a man do they ever truly grow up these boys or is the man face just a mask who knows i figured cassie would tell me in time or she wouldnt i enjoyed her company though despite the shadow which seemed to hang above her mostly our conversations went on like this dancing back and forth between sadness and inanity sometimes shed talk about her favourite tv programmes and how she thought sheldon from big bang theory was cute but always our conversations crept back to this thing the story she withheld how shed been wronged and how someone had done her wrong although exact details were still not forthcoming i told her since she was awake anyway she should get a job somewhere like this not here though i added quietly there are better places to work than here she told me shed consider it if id initially hoped things at grewtech would improve with time then ive been disappointed nearly a month has now passed and the atmosphere remains mutinous if anything my isolation from their lonely tribe is even more pronounced each night i approach the island of light where i spend my nights the lifers before me as usual waiting for my approach black eyes burning into me the cold of the room creeping into my bones despite the layers of clothing i now wear each night and it is with a heavy sense of dread that i reach the pod cold air my breath visible colder than ever it seems and i wonder if theyre doing it on purpose literally trying to freeze me out i havent seen my manager tom since my interview i have the feeling he avoids this lot in the same way i would if i could maybe hes as uncomfortable in the chill glare of the lifers as i am certainly hes been ignoring my texts asking if someone could take a look at the air con sometimes some days as the scorching sunshine roasts the other side of my heavy curtains i dream of their eyes upon me leering at me with malicious intent waking with a start from my sleep as the dusky golden light drains off into night i like call centre work because normally you take nothing home with you there is no overhang from your working day no worries about tasks youve failed to complete you disconnect the call and all is gone even here though pulling the duvet over my head the night shift remains with me and as i awake its as though i never even left and i consider just chucking it in not going back but i know i wont as i hear mum down the hall in the kitchen brewing fresh coffee to bring me round for the night ahead followed by dinner for breakfast i suppose i will stick with it i need the cash if nothing else its a strange existence night work in some ways it doesnt surprise me my coworkers are pocked by their alternate reality there are different rules for us nocturnal beasts im just a tourist to them this is their life i noticed something curious about the island tonight its not the whole room which is icy cold its just the island just the work area where we all gather and i know its stupid but part of me has begun to wonder if the cold emanates from my colleagues themselves iciness in their hearts surrounding us ridiculous melodramatic but thats the problem with being a creative writing major working the graveyard shift it exaggerates real life and magnifies an already overactive imagination but part of me is certain its not just invention because cold surrounds them pours out of their malevolent slack jawed faces and also because ive started to notice something i dont quite understand yet they seem to radiate something else when they look in my direction something approaching fear not just hatred not just fear but terror they hate me because on some level they fear me it makes no sense but im sure im correct lately ive began to take cassies calls away from the desk the range on the bluetooth allowing me to sit in the break room and become a little more candid about my life here im grateful to have someone to talk to a friendly voice in the darkness but there is a cost to this transaction and when i return to my desk the looks i receive are even more glowering than usual and yellow in particular looks as though ive been stealing his white out inscribed stationery from his desk i dont know if i can make it through the summer here id tell cassie last year i was working in the big cctv control centre in town and that was really good fun spying on the city eyes in the sky watching the nightlife dwindle to nothing more than saturday night drunks fighting over doorway space with bums i applied again this summer but they were fully staffed sounds a bit voyeuristic you make it sound like a bad thing i laughed but youre right though that is part of the appeal i remember one night watching this guy standing outside a bar downtown wearing a shiny grey suit his briefcase on a table talking animatedly on his phone and strutting back and forth on the sidewalk and all the while this other fella edged behind him towards his briefcase you saw him take it it was so obvious the case was going to go i mean the guy telegraphed his moves so demonstrably he should have been wearing a stripy top and mask and carrying a sack marked swag he edged toward the guy almost tiptoeing and the man like most people was paying no attention to anything at all just yabbering onto whoever was on the other end of the line this went on for what seemed like ten minutes although when we gave the tape to the sheriffs office afterwards it was less than sixty seconds before the guy in the cincinnati reds tshirt made off with the case did he chase after him cassie asked fascinated the shiny suit man didnt even see him go i told her he was crawling around under the table looking for the case when the police arrived to explain what had happened cassie giggled again then paused did they catch him the thief no he was long gone was there much in the bag a laptop and a chicken salad sandwich nothing entirely irreplaceable but it might teach shinysuit has to keep a closer eye on his stuff next time its not right though someone takes what isnt theirs and never pays for it true someone should pay if they do wrong true i repeat hearing a new tone in her voice the silence hung there for a moment and i wondered if it was now if she was going to tell me they really hurt me you know she had alluded to this so many time but always refused to be drawn allowing it to hang back behind the conversation the ogre of those who mistreated her id assumed it was a man id assumed it was an exboyfriend or boyfriends dark figures who continued to be present for cassie even in their absence but i had avoided bringing the topic up myself was it a boyfriend was it i struggled for words was it something someone else it was all of them who them then she added steve todd and irene you call them the lifers it was them returning to my desk i viewed my workspace anew i wasnt the first to sit at my desk it seemed wasnt the first to put up with the bullying or unpleasantness of the lifers and when i reached them i returned their black looks with force as one by one they averted their eyes she had worked here before me she told me the ideal fit for her what with her penchant for gadgetry and obvious insomnia even before what they did i struggled to sleep she told me go on steve seemed nice at first trying to romance me a little and though he wasnt really my type well the attention was nice cassie hesitated here needing to explain i didnt lead him on though i dont think i did but irene and steve they said i did they called me a little what cassie sat silent at the other end of the line for the longest time they called me a little prick tease told him i was asking for it just needed a little persuasion i didnt know what to say hated to think about the question i had to ask next what did they do cassie told me her story i was late for my shift that night had hit traffic down on main street where thered been a big crash a car and a truck had smashed into one another and there were police and ambulances there was this guy standing beside the road with his shirt covered in blood and he was weeping whilst another woman held his hand everyone in town was gridlocked in the same trap as they wheeled blanket covered bodies passed the jam eventually they managed to shift some of the debris and a lane was gradually cleared and i was able to move past the carnage and leave it behind rushing up to the office to the island as you call it its funny you call them the lifers because for a time i was going to be one of them the job wasnt a summer thing like it is for you it was the best i could get it was a good job really i know it might seem laughable to a college girl like you but the pay isnt bad and you kinda get used to it my daddy is an exterminator killin bugs and rats and my mom is a housewife mostly aside from a couple of afternoons a week waitressing down at deeks so a nice little office job and having enough money to rent a little apartment of my own was just heaven each night i went in and i enjoyed the chat and the laughter politely edging steve away from talk of romance and dates i gave him the friend speech one night in the break room and he seemed to accept it grudgingly except it turned out he didnt the others i dont think i ever truly knew them and i think they got into his head cassie continued the atmosphere was unusually frosty when i arrived i knew something was up straight away i had the sense of being watched scrutinised irene was eying me like a hunter sighting a deer and i saw something in her eyes akin to hunger youre late todd told me we were all graded more or less the same on the night shift but todd was the unofficial supervisor by dint of longevity i know sorry there was a big accident down on irene cut across me and when she rose she stood taller than i remembered oh you think youre so special then spitting the curse little bitch think youve got it all going on i saw you leading on poor steve little bitch prick tease little bitch i stepped back from the pod instinctively raising my arms as though the insults were physical blows i couldnt understand what was going on let alone why my friend irene appeared to be leading the attack irene i pleaded i dont think theres any call for that prick tease little bitch i couldnt believe it of him as steves voice joined hers and rode into me like a freight train why why would you mess me about like that edging slowly backwards towards the door i looked around for something heavy to defend myself with but drew a blank and instead spun round to run crashing straight into mickey the doorman who had clearly been waiting in the darkness for the show to begin the smell of menthol cigarettes clawing to his uniform youre right about working nights youre your own community day workers dont get it a nocturnal tribe is about right you grow very close and all the rules and policies which drive the day mean nothing in the dark heart of the night daytime managers seldom show up during the dark hours so were left to develop our own strange rhythms and behaviours our own laws and traditions it appeared this autonomy ran deeper than i could have imagined the court of my peers had tried me it seemed and found me guilty steve spoke first the nervous energy which i usually associated with his voice had gone replaced by icy calm hey hon he called to me as he rose revealing a half drunk quart of vodka held loosely between his fingers we here been chattin and we agreed youve been doin me wrong time for you to pay up darlin i could see he was wearing his new shirt the same orange check one which hed been showing off the night hed asked me out on a date clearly he thought this night would go more to plan irenes face glowed maliciously in the cool striplit glow while the other two moved to block access to the exit and fire escape steve hon i implored him if only i could get him back on side then the others might see sense you need to think straight hon whatever honey he cut me off gesturing to the vast darkness of the office we can do this out here in plain view of these here folks or theres a nice warm staff room in there we got a soft blanket and some buds i know which id rather although i reckon irene and the folks here would be amenable to a little show take that little bitch irene shouted take her take her take her all women are not sisters i can only guess at the motivation for her rage as prior to this night irene moonface as you call her i like the name moonface by the way it suits her well irene had appeared to be my friend most nights she was all hello dearie and my how beautiful your skin looks tonight dearie i wish my daughter had skin like yours dearie youre so lucky dearie but tonight i saw beneath the mask as the others took up her battle cry take her take her take her i decided i had only one chance with mock coyness i smiled at steve steve honey it shouldnt be like this how about sunday night when were both off we go down to the big bang and hang out properly get to know each other away from all this i removed the vodka bottle from his hand and took a small sip wincing at the chemical sharpness of the cheap liquor then spoke to him gently trying to ease him round not like this though steve i i broke off as he cracked me across the face with an open palm a look of rage reddening his cheeks they told me youd try and pull shit like this he bawled at me almost crying they told me you were a weaselly little prick tease slut whod do anything to get outta paying her dues well tonight you pay up its not like that you know or i dont think it is i didnt lead steve on or i didnt mean to he might think i did but some men are just like that arent they you smile at them and they think youre offering them sex laugh at their joke and they assume youre sweet on them most men leave it at that but steve had vicious jealous little irene pouring all her own bitterness into his head goading him telling him he was being made to look like a fool by a prickteasing little whore take her they were his chorus urging him on there was a dark codependency in their voices like alcoholics each urging the other to revel in their bad behaviour in an effort to neutralize their own base desires the chorus demanded he continue demanded he take her but judging by the faces of the chorus i knew it wouldnt stop there they were hungry for more than his revenge steve i begged him not like this its not right youre better than this for a moment i saw a flicker of doubt in his face which vanished as the chorus began chanting louder take her take her take her like he was a boxer taking to the ring and his hands moved to the golden buckle of his tan belt ah well honey he announced with a rueful voice and an extravagant wave of his hand well just have to use that desk over there bang bang bang moonface was rapping on the window ripping me from the world cassie had created and i nearly screamed myself as her pox marked visage glared at me through the dusty glass cassie still weeping in my ears they did this to me cassie sobbed they made me like this as i rose to return from my break i saw the lifers anew whereas before i had just seen them as sad and bitter losers no better than the world theyd created for themselves now i knew they were dangerous monsters in the light at the heart of the darkness next night cassie is my first call of the evening and she sounds brighter than usual as i take her into the coffee room to converse ignoring the dirty looks this provokes i feel a lot better she said with a slight lift in her voice ive never talked to anyone before about that night im really grateful i found you i needed to talk about what happened i could see moonface and the others watching me through the doorway as i poured my coffee but i tried to take my time you didnt go to the police then i couldnt not then cassies voice suddenly sounds flat i couldnt tell anyone except you you must i urged her you mustnt let them get away with it you said it yourself people should pay for their crimes there was silence for a moment then i heard a new tone in her voice oh i didnt let them get away with it a short shrill laugh which surprises me somewhat i didnt yellow called across to me come on stop slacking get back on the job so i approach them glaring returning their scathing looks disgusted at what they had done to my predecessor you too special to start on time yellow asks me his eyes piercing or trying to pierce my calm dont start i snapped i know what you did i know what you did what you did to cassie this didnt seem to faze them so i persevered from the moment i walked in here youve acted like im not fit to clean the shit from your shoes yet what you all did to that poor girl i know what you did she told me yet you have the gall to sit there giving me dirty looks the two men looked down at their desks and left moonface to respond we werent looking at you her mouth pursed to a tiny bitter point you stupid bitch we were looking at her the slut she wont leave us alone it is strange to turn and see the world through the eyes of another but as i moved round i found myself looking into eyes which may have once been blue but which were now gray almost transparent and found poor dear cassie standing there alone where she had clearly been standing all along whispering into my headset my friend cassie who couldnt sleep she stood maybe five foot two and had pale blond hair bobbed down to her shoulders her skin so pale as to be almost colorless i saw what could easily have been a ghostly image of myself we could have been sisters the waves of hatred i assumed were directed at me had in fact been fear focused instead at the angel upon my shoulder their toy their article of abuse my voice scratched as i spoke cassie oh cassie they killed you then to them my voice rising you killed her you bastards you killed her stupid little slut killed herself moonface answered defiantly stood right in front of us right where youre standing now and used her daddys gun to plaster her brains over the floor all because she felt guilty about the little party she had with the boys moonface glanced nervously at cassie as she said this cassie shook her head at them eyes piercing them tearing them down yellow looked up and grinned at me suddenly malevolently youve got her headset on you know do you like to party she did steve let out a deep boyish sob and pleaded with moonface and yellow to stop moonface spoke again listen honey if you dont want to share dear cassandras fate she said moonface was clearly wretched under cassies gaze but trying to make a show of boldness and held her courting finger erect in defiance then you might want to keep your trap shut about this noone knows why she shot herself least of all us and i dont want anyone getting the wrong idea yellow who was visibly trying to avoid cassies gaze took a gentler tack look were sorry alright its horrible truly horrible working every night with her watching us well could you he looked at the group for reassurance on his next question could you say sorry to her and ask her to leave us be now i didnt mean it steve broke in weeping loudly tears streaming down the folds of his face i didnt mean it im so sorry please let us be i looked back at cassie this was her decision after all god might be in a position to offer mercy but it wasnt my place it might be hers though she mouthed two words no forgiveness i walked with her to the stairwell where we said our goodbyes do you think the guilt the haunting is punishment enough i asked her cassie smiled she had a pretty smile and i could have imagined us being girlfriends in another time though i suppose we were more than girlfriends anyway now its more complicated than you think she responded do you want me to tell your mom and daddy why you did it if nothing else they could then call the police and stir up the nest i thought her face lit up and i realized this had been her plan all along for me to explain why their seemingly happy and beautiful daughter had done this terrible thing they think i committed this terrible awful sin for no reason and i need them to understand a door slammed on the floor below and i heard footsteps nearing and i thought of the slimy doorman the other party to the crime coming to deal with me maybe but it wasnt it was tom the gentle middleaged man whod originally interviewed me for the job and had been absent even since calling from below his voice bouncing off the concrete in ripples when i looked back towards the office cassie had gone although i knew where she was back standing guard over her prisoners would she ever set them free hello you tom said a quizzical look on his face what are you doing up here now it was my time to look bemused i work up here i spoke slowly to him wondering if he was mad or enchanted wrong floor honey he laughed we dont work up there havent for a year now not since that business then seeing my bafflement grimaced at having to explain in detail damn college kids worse than employing outoftowners he touched my arm gently the old night shift last year one of them went mad and poisoned all her coworkers then shot herself it was in all the papers damn even at nyu youd think this stuff would reach you i got it i understood no forgiveness they were being punished eternally anyway elizabeth youre currently an hour late for your very first shift which honestly isnt ideal although if youve spent your time here wandering round that place he juddered his shoulders theatrically in a creeped out shake then ill forgive you come on i for one have a home and a bed to go to come with me and ill introduce you to the rest of the crew theyre a friendly bunch later when i finally finished my actual first nights work at grewtech i walked across the carpark to my little honda i looked back up at the building its outline becoming visible in the gray dawning light of a breaking day the top floor remained darkened but i saw cassie waving at me from the break room window then blowing me a kiss and i smiled back up and returned the gesture as i drove away
