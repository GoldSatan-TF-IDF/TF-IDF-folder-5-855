the gilded age a tale of today by mark twain and charles dudley warner preface this book was not written for private circulation among friends it was not written to cheer and instruct a diseased relative of the authors it was not thrown off during intervals of wearing labor to amuse an idle hour it was not written for any of these reasons and therefore it is submitted without the usual apologies it will be seen that it deals with an entirely ideal state of society and the chief embarrassment of the writers in this realm of the imagination has been the want of illustrative examples in a state where there is no fever of speculation no inflamed desire for sudden wealth where the poor are all simpleminded and contented and the rich are all honest and generous where society is in a condition of primitive purity and politics is the occupation of only the capable and the patriotic there are necessarily no materials for such a history as we have constructed out of an ideal commonwealth no apology is needed for following the learned custom of placing attractive scraps of literature at the heads of our chapters it has been truly observed by wagner that such headings with their vague suggestions of the matter which is to follow them pleasantly inflame the readers interest without wholly satisfying his curiosity and we will hope that it may be found to be so in the present case our quotations are set in a vast number of tongues this is done for the reason that very few foreign nations among whom the book will circulate can read in any language but their own whereas we do not write for a particular class or sect or nation but to take in the whole world we do not object to criticism and we do not expect that the critic will read the book before writing a notice of it we do not even expect the reviewer of the book will say that he has not read it no we have no anticipations of anything unusual in this age of criticism but if the jupiter who passes his opinion on the novel ever happens to peruse it in some weary moment of his subsequent life we hope that he will not be the victim of a remorse bitter but too late one word more this is what it pretends to be a joint production in the conception of the story the exposition of the characters and in its literal composition there is scarcely a chapter that does not bear the marks of the two writers of the book s l c c d w etext editors note the following chapters were written by mark twain and portions of and see twains letter to dr john brown feb dw chapter i june squire hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks called the stile in front of his house contemplating the morning the locality was obedstown east tennessee you would not know that obedstown stood on the top of a mountain for there was nothing about the landscape to indicate it but it did a mountain that stretched abroad over whole counties and rose very gradually the district was called the knobs of east tennessee and had a reputation like nazareth as far as turning out any good thing was concerned the squires house was a double log cabin in a state of decay two or three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold and lifted their heads sadly whenever mrs hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their bodies rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard a bench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a gourd a cat had begun to drink from the pail but the exertion was overtaxing her energies and she had stopped to rest there was an ashhopper by the fence and an iron pot for softsoapboiling near it this dwelling constituted onefifteenth of obedstown the other fourteen houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the cornfields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his eyes for information squire hawkins got his title from being postmaster of obedstown not that the title properly belonged to the office but because in those regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort and so the usual courtesy had been extended to hawkins the mail was monthly and sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single delivery even a rush like this did not fill up the postmasters whole month though and therefore he kept store in the intervals the squire was contemplating the morning it was balmy and tranquil the vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers the murmur of bees was in the air there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that summer woodlands bring to the senses and the vague pleasurable melancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire presently the united states mail arrived on horseback there was but one letter and it was for the postmaster the longlegged youth who carried the mail tarried an hour to talk for there was no hurry and in a little while the male population of the village had assembled to help as a general thing they were dressed in homespun jeans blue or yellow here were no other varieties of it all wore one suspender and sometimes two yarn ones knitted at home some wore vests but few wore coats such coats and vests as did appear however were rather picturesque than otherwise for they were made of tolerably fanciful patterns of calico a fashion which prevails thereto this day among those of the community who have tastes above the common level and are able to afford style every individual arrived with his hands in his pockets a hand came out occasionally for a purpose but it always went back again after service and if it was the head that was served just the cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under was retained until the next call altered the inclination many hats were present but none were erect and no two were canted just alike we are speaking impartially of men youths and boys and we are also speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual was either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises or smoking the same in a corncob pipe few of the men wore whiskers none wore moustaches some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and hiding the throat the only pattern recognized there as being the correct thing in whiskers but no part of any individuals face had seen a razor for a week these neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier reflectively while he talked but fatigue soon began to show itself and one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the fence humpshouldered and grave like a company of buzzards assembled for supper and listening for the deathrattle old damrell said tha haint no news bout the jedge hit aint likely caint tell for sartin some thinks hes gwyne to be long toreckly and some thinks e haint russ mosely he tote ole hanks he mought git to obeds tomorrer or nex day he

i spect the speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stemend of a tomato and shot a bumblebee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away one after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady aim and faultless accuracy whats a stirrin down bout the forks continued old damrell well i dunno skasely ole drake higgins hes ben

there was a dogfight over in the neighborhood of the blacksmith shop and the visitors slid off their perch like so many turtles and strode to the battlefield with an interest bordering on eagerness the squire remained and read his letter then he sighed and sat long in meditation at intervals he said missouri missouri well well well everything is so uncertain at last he said i believe ill do it a man will just rot here my house my yard everything around me in fact shows that i am becoming one of these cattle and i used to be thrifty in other times he was not more than thirtyfive but he had a worn look that made him seem older he left the stile entered that part of his house which was the store traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of beeswax to an old dame in linseywoolsey put his letter away an went into the kitchen his wife was there constructing some dried apple pies a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weathervane of his own contriving his small sister close upon four years of age was sopping cornbread in some gravy left in the bottom of a fryingpan and trying hard not to sop over a fingermark that divided the pan through the middle for the other side belonged to the brother whose musings made him forget his stomach for the moment a negro woman was busy cooking at a vast fireplace shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the place nancy ive made up my mind the world is done with me and perhaps i ought to be done with it but no matter i can wait i am going to missouri i wont stay in this dead country and decay with it ive had it on my mind sometime im going to sell out here for whatever i can get and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start anywhere that suits you suits me si and the children cant be any worse off in missouri than they are here i reckon motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room hawkins said no theyll be better off ive looked out for them nancy and his face lighted do you see these papers well they are evidence that i have taken up seventyfive thousand acres of land in this county think what an enormous fortune it will be some day why nancy enormous dont express it the words too tame i tell your nancy for goodness sake si wait nancy wait let me finish ive been secretly bailing and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks and i must talk or ill burst i havent whispered to a soul not a word have had my countenance under lock and key for fear it might drop something that would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine thats glaring under their noses now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly five or ten dollars the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an acre now but some day people wild be glad to get it for twenty dollars fifty dollars a hundred dollars an acre what should you say to here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see that there were no eavesdroppers a thousand dollars an acre well you may open your eyes and stare but its so you and i may not see the day but theyll see it mind i tell you theyll see it nancy youve heard of steamboats and maybe you believed in them of course you did youve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies and humbugs but theyre not lies and humbugs theyre a reality and theyre going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now theyre going to make a revolution in this worlds affairs that will make men dizzy to contemplate ive been watching ive been watching while some people slept and i know whats coming even you and i will see the day that steamboats will come up that little turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours and in high water theyll come right to it and this is not all nancy it isnt even half theres a bigger wonder the railroad these worms here have never even heard of it and when they do theyll not believe in it but its another fact coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an hour heavens and earth think of that nancy twenty miles an hour it makes a mains brain whirl some day when you and i are in our graves therell be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles all the way down from the cities of the northern states to new orleans and its got to run within thirty miles of this land may be even touch a corner of it well do you know theyve quit burning wood in some places in the eastern states and what do you suppose they burn coal he bent over and whispered again theres world worlds of it on this land you know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch well thats it youve taken it for rocks so has every body here and theyve built little dams and such things with it one man was going to build a chimney out of it nancy i expect i turned as white as a sheet why it might have caught fire and told everything i showed him it was too crumbly then he was going to build it of copper ore splendid yellow fortypercent ore theres fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our land it scared me to death the idea of this fool starting a smelting furnace in his house without knowing it and getting his dull eyes opened and then he was going to build it of iron ore theres mountains of iron ore here nancy whole mountains of it i wouldnt take any chances i just stuck by him i haunted him i never let him alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this dismal country pine forests wheat land corn land iron copper coalwait till the railroads come and the steamboats well never see the day nancy never in the world never never never child weve got to drag along drag along and eat crusts in toil and poverty all hopeless and forlorn but theyll ride in coaches nancy theyll live like the princes of the earth theyll be courted and worshiped their names will be known from ocean to ocean ah welladay will they ever come back here on the railroad and the steamboat and say this one little spot shall not be touched this hovel shall be sacred for here our father and our mother suffered for us thought for us laid the foundations of our future as solid as the hills you are a great good noble soul si hawkins and i am an honored woman to be the wife of such a man and the tears stood in her eyes when she said it we will go to missouri you are out of your place here among these groping dumb creatures we will find a higher place where you can walk with your own kind and be understood when you speak not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue i would go anywhere anywhere in the wide world with you i would rather my body would starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land spoken like yourself my child but well not starve nancy far from it i have a letter from beriah sellers just came this day a letter that ill read you a line from it he flew out of the room a shadow blurred the sunlight in nancys face there was uneasiness in it and disappointment a procession of disturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind saying nothing aloud she sat with her hands in her lap now and then she clasped them then unclasped them then tapped the ends of the fingers together sighed nodded smiled occasionally paused shook her head this pantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which had something of this shape i was afraid of it was afraid of it trying to make our fortune in virginia beriah sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in kentucky and start over again trying to make our fortune in kentucky he crippled us again and we had to move here trying to make our fortune here he brought us clear down to the ground nearly hes an honest soul and means the very best in the world but im afraid im afraid hes too flighty he has splendid ideas and hell divide his chances with his friends with a free hand the good generous soul but something does seem to always interfere and spoil everything i never did think he was right well balanced but i dont blame my husband for i do think that when that man gets his head full of a new notion he can outtalk a machine hell make anybody believe in that notion thatll listen to him ten minutes why i do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe in it and get beside himself if you only set him where he could see his eyes tally and watch his hands explain what a head he has got when he got up that idea there in virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes in delaware and virginia and tennessee very quiet having papers drawn to have them delivered at a place in alabama and take them and pay for them away yonder at a certain time and then in the meantime get a law made stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a certain day it was somehow that way mercy how the man would have made money negroes would have gone up to four prices but after hed spent money and worked hard and traveled hard and had heaps of negroes all contracted for and everything going along just right he couldnt get the laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled and there in kentucky when he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a perpetual motion machine for twentytwo years and beriah sellers saw at a glance where just one more little cogwheel would settle the business why i could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and hammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the doors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel oceans of money in it anybody could see that but it did cost a deal to buy the old numskull out and then when they put the new cog wheel in theyd overlooked something somewhere and it wasnt any use the troublesome thing wouldnt go that notion he got up here did look as handy as anything in the world and how him and si did sit up nights working at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any neighbors were about the man did honestly believe there was a fortune in that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank si says is coal and he refined it himself till it was like water nearly and it did burn theres no two ways about that and i reckon hed have been all right in cincinnati with his lamp that he got made that time he got a house full of rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech it let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd i havent got over grieving for the money that cost yet i am sorry enough beriah sellers is in missouri now but i was glad when he went i wonder what his letter says but of course its cheerful hes never downhearted never had any trouble in his life didnt know it if he had its always sunrise with that man and fine and blazing at that never gets noon though leaves off and rises again nobody can help liking the creature he means so well but i do dread to come across him again hes bound to set us all crazy of coarse well there goes old widow hopkins it always takes her a week to buy a spool of thread and trade a hank of yarn maybe si can come with the letter now and he did widow hopkins kept me i havent any patience with such tedious people now listen nancy just listen at this come right along to missouri dont wait and worry about a good price but sell out for whatever you can get and come along or you might be too late throw away your traps if necessary and come emptyhanded youll never regret it its the grandest country the loveliest land the purest atmosphere i cant describe it no pen can do it justice and its filling up every day people coming from everywhere ive got the biggest scheme on earth and ill take you in ill take in every friend ive got thats ever stood by me for theres enough for all and to spare mums the word dont whisper keep yourself to yourself youll see come rush hurry dont wait for anything its the same old boy nancy jest the same old boy aint he yes i think theres a little of the old sound about his voice yet i suppose you youll still go si go well i should think so nancy its all a chance of course and chances havent been kind to us ill admit but whatever comes old wife theyre provided for thank god for that amen came low and earnestly and with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered obedstown and almost took its breath away the hawkinses hurried through with their arrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great mysterious blank that lay beyond the knobs of tennessee chapter ii toward the close of the third days journey the wayfarers were just beginning to think of camping when they came upon a log cabin in the woods hawkins drew rein and entered the yard a boy about ten years old was sitting in the cabin door with his face bowed in his hands hawkins approached expecting his footfall to attract attention but it did not he halted a moment and then said come come little chap you mustnt be going to sleep before sundown with a tired expression the small face came up out of the hands a face down which tears were flowing ah im sorry i spoke so my boy tell me is anything the matter the boy signified with a scarcely perceptible gesture that the trouble was in the house and made room for hawkins to pass then he put his face in his hands again and rocked himself about as one suffering a grief that is too deep to find help in moan or groan or outcry hawkins stepped within it was a poverty stricken place six or eight middleaged country people of both sexes were grouped about an object in the middle of the room they were noiselessly busy and they talked in whispers when they spoke hawkins uncovered and approached a coffin stood upon two backless chairs these neighbors had just finished disposing the body of a woman in it a woman with a careworn gentle face that had more the look of sleep about it than of death an old lady motioned toward the door and said to hawkins in a whisper his mother po thing died of the fever last night tha warnt no sich thing as saving of her but its better for her better for her husband and the other two children died in the spring and she haint ever hilt up her head sence she jest went around brokenhearted like and never took no intrust in anything but clay thats the boy thar she jest worshiped clay and clay he worshiped her they didnt pear to live at all only when they was together looking at each other loving one another shes ben sick three weeks and if you believe me that child has worked and kep the run of the medcin and the times of giving it and sot up nights and nussed her and tried to keep up her sperits the same as a grownup person and last night when she kep a sinking and sinking and turned away her head and didnt know him no mo it was fitten to make a bodys heart break to see him climb onto the bed and lay his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not answer but bymeby she roused up like and looked around wild and then she see him and she made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and hilt him close and kissed him over and over agin but it took the last po strength she had and so her eyelids begin to close down and her arms sort o drooped away and then we see she was gone po creetur and clay he oh the po motherless thing i caint talk abort it i caint bear to talk about it clay had disappeared from the door but he came in now and the neighbors reverently fell apart and made way for him he leaned upon the open coffin and let his tears course silently then he put out his small hand and smoothed the hair and stroked the dead face lovingly after a bit he brought his other hand up from behind him and laid three or four fresh wild flowers upon the breast bent over and kissed the unresponsive lips time and time again and then turned away and went out of the house without looking at any of the company the old lady said to hawkins she always loved that kind o flowers he fetched em for her every morning and she always kissed him they was from away north somers she kep school when she fust come goodness knows whats to become o that po boy no father no mother no kin folks of no kind nobody to go to nobody that kyers for him and all of us is so put to it for to get along and families so large hawkins understood all eyes were turned inquiringly upon him he said friends i am not very well provided for myself but still i would not turn my back on a homeless orphan if he will go with me i will give him a home and loving regard i will do for him as i would have another do for a child of my own in misfortune one after another the people stepped forward and wrung the strangers hand with cordial good will and their eyes looked all that their hands could not express or their lips speak said like a true man said one you was a stranger to me a minute ago but you aint now said another its bread cast upon the waters itll return after many days said the old lady whom we have heard speak before you got to camp in my house as long as you hang out here said one if tha haint room for you and yourn my tribell turn out and camp in the hay loft a few minutes afterward while the preparations for the funeral were being concluded mr hawkins arrived at his wagon leading his little waif by the hand and told his wife all that had happened and asked her if he had done right in giving to her and to himself this new care she said if youve done wrong si hawkins its a wrong that will shine brighter at the judgment day than the rights that many a man has done before you and there isnt any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing like this and finishing it up just taking it for granted that ill be willing to it willing come to me you poor motherless boy and let me take your grief and help you carry it when the child awoke in the morning it was as if from a troubled dream but slowly the confusion in his mind took form and he remembered his great loss the beloved form in the coffin his talk with a generous stranger who offered him a home the funeral where the strangers wife held him by the hand at the grave and cried with him and comforted him and he remembered how this new mother tucked him in his bed in the neighboring farm house and coaxed him to talk about his troubles and then heard him say his prayers and kissed him good night and left him with the soreness in his heart almost healed and his bruised spirit at rest and now the new mother came again and helped him to dress and combed his hair and drew his mind away by degrees from the dismal yesterday by telling him about the wonderful journey he was going to take and the strange things he was going to see and after breakfast they two went alone to the grave and his heart went out to his new friend and his untaught eloquence poured the praises of his buried idol into her ears without let or hindrance together they planted roses by the headboard and strewed wild flowers upon the grave and then together they went away hand in hand and left the dead to the long sleep that heals all heartaches and ends all sorrows chapter iii whatever the lagging dragging journey may have been to the rest of the emigrants it was a wonder and delight to the children a world of enchantment and they believed it to be peopled with the mysterious dwarfs and giants and goblins that figured in the tales the negro slaves were in the habit of telling them nightly by the shuddering light of the kitchen fire at the end of nearly a week of travel the party went into camp near a shabby village which was caving house by house into the hungry mississippi the river astonished the children beyond measure its milebreadth of water seemed an ocean to them in the shadowy twilight and the vague riband of trees on the further shore the verge of a continent which surely none but they had ever seen before uncle danlcolored aged his wife aunt jinny aged young miss emily hawkins young mars washington hawkins and young mars clay the new member of the family ranged themselves on a log after supper and contemplated the marvelous river and discussed it the moon rose and sailed aloft through a maze of shredded cloudwreaths the sombre river just perceptibly brightened under the veiled light a deep silence pervaded the air and was emphasized at intervals rather than broken by the hooting of an owl the baying of a dog or the muffled crash of a raving bank in the distance the little company assembled on the log were all children at least in simplicity and broad and comprehensive ignorance and the remarks they made about the river were in keeping with the character and so awed were they by the grandeur and the solemnity of the scene before then and by their belief that the air was filled with invisible spirits and that the faint zephyrs were caused by their passing wings that all their talk took to itself a tinge of the supernatural and their voices were subdued to a low and reverent tone suddenly uncle danl exclaimed chilen dahs sum fin a comin all crowded close together and every heart beat faster uncle danl pointed down the river with his bony finger a deep coughing sound troubled the stillness way toward a wooded cape that jetted into the stream a mile distant all in an instant a fierce eye of fire shot out froth behind the cape and sent a long brilliant pathway quivering athwart the dusky water the coughing grew louder and louder the glaring eye grew larger and still larger glared wilder and still wilder a huge shape developed itself out of the gloom and from its tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke starred and spangled with sparks poured out and went tumbling away into the farther darkness nearer and nearer the thing came till its long sides began to glow with spots of light which mirrored themselves in the river and attended the monster like a torchlight procession what is it oh what is it uncle danl with deep solemnity the answer came its de almighty git down on yo knees it was not necessary to say it twice they were all kneeling in a moment and then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and stronger and the threatening glare reached farther and wider the negros voice lifted up its supplications o lord wes ben mighty wicked an we knows dat we zerve to go to de bad place but good lord deah lord we aint ready yit we aint ready let dese po chilen hab one mo chance jes one mo chance take de ole niggah if yous got to hab somebody good lord good deah lord we dont know whah yous a gwyne to we dont know who yous got yo eye

twenty steps away the awful thunder of a mudvalve suddenly burst forth drowning the prayer and as suddenly uncle danl snatched a child under each arm and scoured into the woods with the rest of the pack at his heels and then ashamed of himself he halted in the deep darkness and shouted but rather feebly heah i is lord heah i is there was a moment of throbbing suspense and then to the surprise and the comfort of the party it was plain that the august presence had gone by for its dreadful noises were receding uncle danl headed a cautious reconnaissance in the direction of the log sure enough the lord was just turning a point a short distance up the river and while they looked the lights winked out and the coughing diminished by degrees and presently ceased altogether hwsh well now deys some folks says dey aint no ficiency in prah dis chile would like to know whah wed a ben now if it warnt fo dat prah dats it dats it uncle danl do you reckon it was the prayer that saved us said clay

he went so far that he doubted himself if the lord heard him when he went by chapter iv seventhly before his voyage he should make his peace with god satisfie his creditors if he be in debt pray earnestly to god to prosper him in his voyage and to keep him from danger and if he be sui juris he should make his last will and wisely order all his affairs since many that go far abroad return not home this good and christian counsel is given by martinus zeilerus in his apodemical canons before his itinerary of spain and portugal early in the morning squire hawkins took passage in a small steamboat with his family and his two slaves and presently the bell rang the stageplank was hauled in and the vessel proceeded up the river the children and the slaves were not much more at ease after finding out that this monster was a creature of human contrivance than they were the night before when they thought it the lord of heaven and earth they started in fright every time the gaugecocks sent out an angry hiss and they quaked from head to foot when the mudvalves thundered the shivering of the boat under the beating of the wheels was sheer misery to them but of course familiarity with these things soon took away their terrors and then the voyage at once became a glorious adventure a royal progress through the very heart and home of romance a realization of their rosiest wonderdreams they sat by the hour in the shade of the pilot house on the hurricane deck and looked out over the curving expanses of the river sparkling in the sunlight sometimes the boat fought the midstream current with a verdant world on either hand and remote from both sometimes she closed in under a point where the dead water and the helping eddies were and shaved the bank so closely that the decks were swept by the jungle of overhanging willows and littered with a spoil of leaves departing from these points she regularly crossed the river every five miles avoiding the bight of the great binds and thus escaping the strong current sometimes she went out and skirted a high bluff sandbar in the middle of the stream and occasionally followed it up a little too far and touched upon the shoal water at its head and then the intelligent craft refused to run herself aground but smelt the bar and straightway the foamy streak that streamed away from her bows vanished a great foamless wave rolled forward and passed her under way and in this instant she leaned far over on her side shied from the bar and fled square away from the danger like a frightened thing and the pilot was lucky if he managed to straighten her up before she drove her nose into the opposite bank sometimes she approached a solid wall of tall trees as if she meant to break through it but all of a sudden a little crack would open just enough to admit her and away she would go plowing through the chute with just barely room enough between the island on one side and the main land on the other in this sluggish water she seemed to go like a racehorse now and then small log cabins appeared in little clearings with the neverfailing frowsy women and girls in soiled and faded linseywoolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles and rail fences gazing sleepily at the passing show sometimes she found shoal water going out at the head of those chutes or crossing the river and then a deckhand stood on the bow and hove the lead while the boat slowed down and moved cautiously sometimes she stopped a moment at a landing and took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of slouchy white men and negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on with their hands in their pantaloons pockets of course for they never took them out except to stretch and when they did this they squirmed about and reached their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on tiptoe in an ecstasy of enjoyment when the sun went down it turned all the broad river to a national banner laid in gleaming bars of gold and purple and crimson and in time these glories faded out in the twilight and left the fairy archipelagoes reflecting their fringing foliage in the steely mirror of the stream at night the boat forged on through the deep solitudes of the river hardly ever discovering a light to testify to a human presence mile after mile and league after league the vast bends were guarded by unbroken walls of forest that had never been disturbed by the voice or the footfall of man or felt the edge of his sacrilegious axe an hour after supper the moon came up and clay and washington ascended to the hurricane deck to revel again in their new realm of enchantment they ran races up and down the deck climbed about the bell made friends with the passengerdogs chained under the lifeboat tried to make friends with a passengerbear fastened to the vergestaff but were not encouraged skinned the cat on the hogchains in a word exhausted the amusementpossibilities of the deck then they looked wistfully up at the pilot house and finally little by little clay ventured up there followed diffidently by washington the pilot turned presently to get his sternmarks saw the lads and invited them in now their happiness was complete this cosy little house built entirely of glass and commanding a marvelous prospect in every direction was a magicians throne to them and their enjoyment of the place was simply boundless they sat them down on a high bench and looked miles ahead and saw the wooded capes fold back and reveal the bends beyond and they looked miles to the rear and saw the silvery highway diminish its breadth by degrees and close itself together in the distance presently the pilot said by george yonder comes the amaranth a spark appeared close to the water several miles down the river the pilot took his glass and looked at it steadily for a moment and said chiefly to himself it cant be the blue wing she couldnt pick us up this way its the amaranth sure he bent over a speaking tube and said whos on watch down there a hollow unhuman voice rumbled up through the tube in answer i am second engineer good you want to stir your stumps now harry the amaranths just turned the point and shes just a humping herself too the pilot took hold of a rope that stretched out forward jerked it twice and two mellow strokes of the big bell responded a voice out on the deck shouted stand by down there with that labboard lead no i dont want the lead said the pilot i want you roust out the old man tell him the amaranths coming and go and call jim tell him ayeaye sir the old man was the captain he is always called so on steamboats and ships jim was the other pilot within two minutes both of these men were flying up the pilothouse stairway three steps at a jump jim was in his shirt sleeves with his coat and vest on his arm he said i was just turning in wheres the glass he took it and looked dont appear to be any nighthawk on the jackstaff its the amaranth dead sure the captain took a good long look and only said damnation george davis the pilot on watch shouted to the nightwatchman on deck hows she loaded two inches by the head sir t aint enough the captain shouted now call the mate tell him to call all hands and get a lot of that sugar forrard put her ten inches by the head lively now ayeaye sir a riot of shouting and trampling floated up from below presently and the uneasy steering of the boat soon showed that she was getting down by the head the three men in the pilot house began to talk in short sharp sentences low and earnestly as their excitement rose their voices went down as fast as one of them put down the spyglass another took it up but always with a studied air of calmness each time the verdict was shes a gaining the captain spoke through the tube what steam are you carrying a hundred and fortytwo sir but shes getting hotter and hotter all the time the boat was straining and groaning and quivering like a monster in pain both pilots were at work now one on each side of the wheel with their coats and vests off their bosoms and collars wide open and the perspiration flowing down heir faces they were holding the boat so close to the shore that the willows swept the guards almost from stem to stern stand by whispered george all ready said jim under his breath let her come the boat sprang away from the bank like a deer and darted in a long diagonal toward the other shore she closed in again and thrashed her fierce way along the willows as before the captain put down the glass lord how she walks up on us i do hate to be beat jim said george looking straight ahead watching the slightest yawing of the boat and promptly meeting it with the wheel howll it do to try murderers chute well its its taking chances how was the cottonwood stump on the false point below boardmans island this morning water just touching the roots well its pretty close work that gives six feet scant in the head of murderers chute we can just barely rub through if we hit it exactly right but its worth trying she dont dare tackle it meaning the amaranth in another instant the boreas plunged into what seemed a crooked creek and the amaranths approaching lights were shut out in a moment not a whisper was uttered now but the three men stared ahead into the shadows and two of them spun the wheel back and forth with anxious watchfulness while the steamer tore along the chute seemed to come to an end every fifty yards but always opened out in time now the head of it was at hand george tapped the big bell three times two leadsmen sprang to their posts and in a moment their weird cries rose on the night air and were caught up and repeated by two men on the upper deck noo bottom deep four half three quarter three mark under waater three half twain quarter twain davis pulled a couple of ropes there was a jingling of small bells far below the boats speed slackened and the pent steam began to whistle and the gaugecocks to scream by the mark twain quar ter her er less twain eight and a half eight feet sevenanahalf another jingling of little bells and the wheels ceased turning altogether the whistling of the steam was something frightful now it almost drowned all other noises stand by to meet her george had the wheel hard down and was standing on a spoke all ready the boat hesitated seemed to hold her breath as did the captain and pilots and then she began to fall away to starboard and every eye lighted now then meet her meet her snatch her the wheel flew to port so fast that the spokes blended into a spiderweb the swing of the boat subsided she steadied herself seven feet sev six and a half six feet six f bang she hit the bottom george shouted through the tube spread her wide open whale it at her powwowchow the escapepipes belched snowy pillars of steam aloft the boat ground and surged and trembled and slid over into mark twain quarterher tap tap tap to signify lay in the leads and away she went flying up the willow shore with the whole silver sea of the mississippi stretching abroad on every hand no amaranth in sight haha boys we took a couple of tricks that time said the captain and just at that moment a red glare appeared in the head of the chute and the amaranth came springing after them well i swear jim what is the meaning of that ill tell you whats the meaning of it that hail we had at napoleon was wash hastings wanting to come to cairo and we didnt stop hes in that pilot house now showing those mud turtles how to hunt for easy water thats it i thought it wasnt any slouch that was running that middle bar in hogeye bend if its wash hastings well what he dont know about the river aint worth knowing a regular goldleaf kidglove diamond breastpin pilot wash hastings is we wont take any tricks off of him old man i wish id a stopped for him thats all the amaranth was within three hundred yards of the boreas and still gaining the old man spoke through the tube what is shecarrying now a hundred and sixtyfive sir hows your wood pine all outcypress half goneeating up cottonwood like pie break into that rosin on the main deckpile it in the boat can pay for it soon the boat was plunging and quivering and screaming more madly than ever but the amaranths head was almost abreast the boreass stern hows your steam now harry hundred and eightytwo sir break up the casks of bacon in the forrard hold pile it in levy on that turpentine in the fantaildrench every stick of wood with it the boat was a moving earthquake by this time how is she now a hundred and ninetysix and still aswelling water below the middle gaugecocks carrying every pound she can stand nigger roosting on the safetyvalve good hows your draft bully every time a nigger heaves a stick of wood into the furnace he goes out the chimney with it the amaranth drew steadily up till her jackstaff breasted the boreass wheelhouse climbed along inch by inch till her chimneys breasted it crept along further and further till the boats were wheel to wheel and then they closed up with a heavy jolt and locked together tight and fast in the middle of the big river under the flooding moonlight a roar and a hurrah went up from the crowded decks of both steamers all hands rushed to the guards to look and shout and gesticulate the weight careened the vessels over toward each other officers flew hither and thither cursing and storming trying to drive the people amidships both captains were leaning over their railings shaking their fists swearing and threatening black volumes of smoke rolled up and canopied the scene delivering a rain of sparks upon the vessels two pistol shots rang out and both captains dodged unhurt and the packed masses of passengers surged back and fell apart while the shrieks of women and children soared above the intolerable din and then there was a booming roar a thundering crash and the riddled amaranth dropped loose from her hold and drifted helplessly away instantly the firedoors of the boreas were thrown open and the men began dashing buckets of water into the furnaces for it would have been death and destruction to stop the engines with such a head of steam on as soon as possible the boreas dropped down to the floating wreck and took off the dead the wounded and the unhurt at least all that could be got at for the whole forward half of the boat was a shapeless ruin with the great chimneys lying crossed on top of it and underneath were a dozen victims imprisoned alive and wailing for help while men with axes worked with might and main to free these poor fellows the boreass boats went about picking up stragglers from the river and now a new horror presented itself the wreck took fire from the dismantled furnaces never did men work with a heartier will than did those stalwart braves with the axes but it was of no use the fire ate its way steadily despising the bucket brigade that fought it it scorched the clothes it singed the hair of the axemen it drove them back foot by footinch by inch they wavered struck a final blow in the teeth of the enemy and surrendered and as they fell back they heard prisoned voices saying dont leave us dont desert us dont dont do it and one poor fellow said i am henry worley striker of the amaranth my mother lives in st louis tell her a lie for a poor devils sake please say i was killed in an instant and never knew what hurt me though god knows ive neither scratch nor bruise this moment its hard to burn up in a coop like this with the whole wide world so near goodbye boys weve all got to come to it at last anyway the boreas stood away out of danger and the ruined steamer went drifting down the stream an island of wreathing and climbing flame that vomited clouds of smoke from time to time and glared more fiercely and sent its luminous tongues higher and higher after each emission a shriek at intervals told of a captive that had met his doom the wreck lodged upon a sandbar and when the boreas turned the next point on her upward journey it was still burning with scarcely abated fury when the boys came down into the main saloon of the boreas they saw a pitiful sight and heard a world of pitiful sounds eleven poor creatures lay dead and forty more lay moaning or pleading or screaming while a score of good samaritans moved among them doing what they could to relieve their sufferings bathing their chinless faces and bodies with linseed oil and lime water and covering the places with bulging masses of raw cotton that gave to every face and form a dreadful and unhuman aspect a little wee french midshipman of fourteen lay fearfully injured but never uttered a sound till a physician of memphis was about to dress his hurts then he said can i get well you need not be afraid to tell me no i i am afraid you can not then do not waste your time with me help those that can get well but help those that can get well it is not for me to be a girl i carry the blood of eleven generations of soldiers in my veins the physician himself a man who had seen service in the navy in his time touched his hat to this little hero and passed on the head engineer of the amaranth a grand specimen of physical manhood struggled to his feet a ghastly spectacle and strode toward his brother the second engineer who was unhurt he said you were on watch you were boss you would not listen to me when i begged you to reduce your steam take that take it to my wife and tell her it comes from me by the hand of my murderer take it and take my curse with it to blister your heart a hundred years and may you live so long and he tore a ring from his finger stripping flesh and skin with it threw it down and fell dead but these things must not be dwelt upon the boreas landed her dreadful cargo at the next large town and delivered it over to a multitude of eager hands and warm southern hearts a cargo amounting by this time to wounded persons and dead bodies and with these she delivered a list of missing persons that had drowned or otherwise perished at the scene of the disaster a jury of inquest was impaneled and after due deliberation and inquiry they returned the inevitable american verdict which has been so familiar to our ears all the days of our lives nobody to blame the incidents of the explosion are not invented they happened just as they are told the authors chapter v il veut faire secher de la neige au four et la vendre pour du sel blanc when the boreas backed away from the land to continue her voyage up the river the hawkinses were richer by twentyfour hours of experience in the contemplation of human suffering and in learning through honest hard work how to relieve it and they were richer in another way also in the early turmoil an hour after the explosion a little blackeyed girl of five years frightened and crying bitterly was struggling through the throng in the boreas saloon calling her mother and father but no one answered something in the face of mr hawkins attracted her and she came and looked up at him was satisfied and took refuge with him he petted her listened to her troubles and said he would find her friends for her then he put her in a stateroom with his children and told them to be kind to her the adults of his party were all busy with the wounded and straightway began his search it was fruitless but all day he and his wife made inquiries and hoped against hope all that they could learn was that the child and her parents came on board at new orleans where they had just arrived in a vessel from cuba that they looked like people from the atlantic states that the family name was van brunt and the childs name laura this was all the parents had not been seen since the explosion the childs manners were those of a little lady and her clothes were daintier and finer than any mrs hawkins had ever seen before as the hours dragged on the child lost heart and cried so piteously for her mother that it seemed to the hawkinses that the moanings and the wailings of the mutilated men and women in the saloon did not so strain at their heartstrings as the sufferings of this little desolate creature they tried hard to comfort her and in trying learned to love her they could not help it seeing how she clung to them and put her arms about their necks and foundno solace but in their kind eyes and comforting words there was a question in both their hearts a question that rose up and asserted itself with more and more pertinacity as the hours wore on but both hesitated to give it voice both kept silence and waited but a time came at last when the matter would bear delay no longer the boat had landed and the dead and the wounded were being conveyed to the shore the tired child was asleep in the arms of mrs hawkins mr hawkins came into their presence and stood without speaking his eyes met his wifes then both looked at the child and as they looked it stirred in its sleep and nestled closer an expression of contentment and peace settled upon its face that touched the motherheart and when the eyes of husband and wife met again the question was asked and answered when the boreas had journeyed some four hundred miles from the time the hawkinses joined her a long rank of steamboats was sighted packed side by side at a wharf like sardines in a box and above and beyond them rose the domes and steeples and general architectural confusion of a city a city with an imposing umbrella of black smoke spread over it this was st louis the children of the hawkins family were playing about the hurricane deck and the father and mother were sitting in the lee of the pilot house essaying to keep order and not greatly grieved that they were not succeeding theyre worth all the trouble they are nancy yes and more si i believe you you wouldnt sell one of them at a good round figure not for all the money in the bank si my own sentiments every time it is true we are not rich but still you are not sorry you havent any misgivings about the additions no god will provide amen and so you wouldnt even part with clay or laura not for anything in the world i love them just the same as i love my own they pet me and spoil me even more than the others do i think i reckon well get along si oh yes it will all come out right old mother i wouldnt be afraid to adopt a thousand children if i wanted to for theres that tennessee land you know enough to make an army of them rich a whole army nancy you and i will never see the day but these little chaps will indeed they will one of these days it will be the rich miss emily hawkins and the wealthy miss laura van brunt hawkins and the hon george washington hawkins millionaire and gov henry clay hawkins millionaire that is the way the world will word it dont lets ever fret about the children nancy never in the world theyre all right nancy theres oceans and oceans of money in that land mark my words the children had stopped playing for the moment and drawn near to listen hawkins said washington my boy what will you do when you get to be one of the richest men in the world i dont know father sometimes i think ill have a balloon and go up in the air and sometimes i think ill have ever so many books and sometimes i think ill have ever so many weathercocks and waterwheels or have a machine like that one you and colonel sellers bought and sometimes i think ill have well somehow i dont know somehow i aint certain maybe ill get a steamboat first the same old chap always just a little bit divided about things and what will you do when you get to be one of the richest men in the world clay i dont know sir my mother my other mother thats gone away she always told me to work along and not be much expecting to get rich and then i wouldnt be disappointed if i didnt get rich and so i reckon its better for me to wait till i get rich and then by that time maybe ill know what ill want but i dont now sir careful old head governor henry clay hawkins thats what youll be clay one of these days wise old head weighty old head go on now and play all of you its a prime lot nancy as the obedstown folk say about their hogs a smaller steamboat received the hawkinses and their fortunes and bore them a hundred and thirty miles still higher up the mississippi and landed them at a little tumbledown village on the missouri shore in the twilight of a mellow october day the next morning they harnessed up their team and for two days they wended slowly into the interior through almost roadless and uninhabited forest solitudes and when for the last time they pitched their tents metaphorically speaking it was at the goal of their hopes their new home by the muddy roadside stood a new log cabin one story high the store clustered in the neighborhood were ten or twelve more cabins some new some old in the sad light of the departing day the place looked homeless enough two or three coatless young men sat in front of the store on a drygoods box and whittled it with their knives kicked it with their vast boots and shot tobaccojuice at various marks several ragged negroes leaned comfortably against the posts of the awning and contemplated the arrival of the wayfarers with lazy curiosity all these people presently managed to drag themselves to the vicinity of the hawkins wagon and there they took up permanent positions hands in pockets and resting on one leg and thus anchored they proceeded to look and enjoy vagrant dogs came wagging around and making inquiries of hawkinss dog which were not satisfactory and they made war on him in concert this would have interested the citizens but it was too many on one to amount to anything as a fight and so they commanded the peace and the foreign dog coiled his tail and took sanctuary under the wagon slatternly negro girls and women slouched along with pails deftly balanced on their heads and joined the group and stared little half dressed white boys and little negro boys with nothing whatever on but towlinen shirts with a fine southern exposure came from various directions and stood with their hands locked together behind them and aided in the inspection the rest of the population were laying down their employments and getting ready to come when a man burst through the assemblage and seized the newcomers by the hands in a frenzy of welcome and exclaimed indeed almost shouted well who could have believed it now is it you sure enough turn around hold up your heads i want to look at you good well well well it does seem most too good to be true i declare lord im so glad to see you does a bodys whole soul good to look at you shake hands again keep on shaking hands goodness gracious alive what will my wife say oh yes indeed its so married only last week lovely perfectly lovely creature the noblest woman that ever youll

here jim tom pete jake fly around take that team to my place put the wagon in my lot put the horses under the shed and get out hay and oats and fill them up aint any hay and oats well get some have it charged to me come spin around now now hawkins the processions ready mark time by the left flank forwardmarch and the colonel took the lead with laura astride his neck and the newlyinspired and very grateful immigrants picked up their tired limbs with quite a spring in them and dropped into his wake presently they were ranged about an oldtime fireplace whose blazing logs sent out rather an unnecessary amount of heat but that was no mattersupper was needed and to have it it had to be cooked this apartment was the family bedroom parlor library and kitchen all in one the matronly little wife of the colonel moved hither and thither and in and out with her pots and pans in her hands happiness in her heart and a world of admiration of her husband in her eyes and when at last she had spread the cloth and loaded it with hot corn bread fried chickens bacon buttermilk coffee and all manner of country luxuries col sellers modified his harangue and for a moment throttled it down to the orthodox pitch for a blessing and then instantly burst forth again as from a parenthesis and clattered on with might and main till every stomach in the party was laden with all it could carry and when the newcomers ascended the ladder to their comfortable feather beds on the second floor to wit the garret mrs hawkins was obliged to say hang the fellow i do believe he has gone wilder than ever but still a body cant help liking him if they would and what is more they dont ever want to try when they see his eyes and hear him talk within a week or two the hawkinses were comfortably domiciled in a new log house and were beginning to feel at home the children were put to school at least it was what passed for a school in those days a place where tender young humanity devoted itself for eight or ten hours a day to learning incomprehensible rubbish by heart out of books and reciting it by rote like parrots so that a finished education consisted simply of a permanent headache and the ability to read without stopping to spell the words or take breath hawkins bought out the village store for a song and proceeded to reap the profits which amounted to but little more than another song the wonderful speculation hinted at by col sellers in his letter turned out to be the raising of mules for the southern market and really it promised very well the young stock cost but a trifle the rearing but another trifle and so hawkins was easily persuaded to embark his slender means in the enterprise and turn over the keep and care of the animals to sellers and uncle danl all went well business prospered little by little hawkins even built a new house made it two full stories high and put a lightning rod on it people came two or three miles to look at it but they knew that the rod attracted the lightning and so they gave the place a wide berth in a storm for they were familiar with marksmanship and doubted if the lightning could hit that small stick at a distance of a mile and a half oftener than once in a hundred and fifty times hawkins fitted out his house with store furniture from st louis and the fame of its magnificence went abroad in the land even the parlor carpet was from st louis though the other rooms were clothed in the rag carpeting of the country hawkins put up the first paling fence that had ever adorned the village and he did not stop there but whitewashed it his oilcloth windowcurtains had noble pictures on them of castles such as had never been seen anywhere in the world but on windowcurtains hawkins enjoyed the admiration these prodigies compelled but he always smiled to think how poor and cheap they were compared to what the hawkins mansion would display in a future day after the tennessee land should have borne its minted fruit even washington observed once that when the tennessee land was sold he would have a store carpet in his and clays room like the one in the parlor this pleased hawkins but it troubled his wife it did not seem wise to her to put ones entire earthly trust in the tennessee land and never think of doing any work hawkins took a weekly philadelphia newspaper and a semiweekly st louis journal almost the only papers that came to the village though godeys ladys book found a good market there and was regarded as the perfection of polite literature by some of the ablest critics in the place perhaps it is only fair to explain that we are writing of a by gone age some twenty or thirty years ago in the two newspapers referred to lay the secret of hawkinss growing prosperity they kept him informed of the condition of the crops south and east and thus he knew which articles were likely to be in demand and which articles were likely to be unsalable weeks and even months in advance of the simple folk about him as the months went by he came to be regarded as a wonderfully lucky man it did not occur to the citizens that brains were at the bottom of his luck his title of squire came into vogue again but only for a season for as his wealth and popularity augmented that title by imperceptible stages grew up into judge indeed it bade fair to swell into general bye and bye all strangers of consequence who visited the village gravitated to the hawkins mansion and became guests of the judge hawkins had learned to like the people of his section very much they were uncouth and not cultivated and not particularly industrious but they were honest and straightforward and their virtuous ways commanded respect their patriotism was strong their pride in the flag was of the old fashioned pattern their love of country amounted to idolatry whoever dragged the national honor in the dirt won their deathless hatred they still cursed benedict arnold as if he were a personal friend who had broken faith but a week gone by chapter vi we skip ten years and this history finds certain changes to record judge hawkins and col sellers have made and lost two or three moderate fortunes in the meantime and are now pinched by poverty sellers has two pairs of twins and four extras in hawkinss family are six children of his own and two adopted ones from time to time as fortune smiled the elder children got the benefit of it spending the lucky seasons at excellent schools in st louis and the unlucky ones at home in the chafing discomfort of straightened circumstances neither the hawkins children nor the world that knew them ever supposed that one of the girls was of alien blood and parentage such difference as existed between laura and emily is not uncommon in a family the girls had grown up as sisters and they were both too young at the time of the fearful accident on the mississippi to know that it was that which had thrown their lives together and yet any one who had known the secret of lauras birth and had seen her during these passing years say at the happy age of twelve or thirteen would have fancied that he knew the reason why she was more winsome than her school companion philosophers dispute whether it is the promise of what she will be in the careless schoolgirl that makes her attractive the undeveloped maidenhood or the mere natural careless sweetness of childhood if laura at twelve was beginning to be a beauty the thought of it had never entered her head no indeed her mind wad filled with more important thoughts to her simple schoolgirl dress she was beginning to add those mysterious little adornments of ribbonknots and earrings which were the subject of earnest consultations with her grown friends when she tripped down the street on a summers day with her dainty hands propped into the ribbonbroidered pockets of her apron and elbows consequently more or less akimbo with her wide leghorn hat flapping down and hiding her face one moment and blowing straight up against her fore head the next and making its revealment of fresh young beauty with all her pretty girlish airs and graces in full play and that sweet ignorance of care and that atmosphere of innocence and purity all about her that belong to her gracious time of life indeed she was a vision to warm the coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest willful generous forgiving imperious affectionate improvident bewitching in short was laura at this period could she have remained there this history would not need to be written but laura had grown to be almost a woman in these few years to the end of which we have now come years which had seen judge hawkins pass through so many trials when the judges first bankruptcy came upon him a homely human angel intruded upon him with an offer of for the tennessee land mrs hawkins said take it it was a grievous temptation but the judge withstood it he said the land was for the children he could not rob them of their future millions for so paltry a sum when the second blight fell upon him another angel appeared and offered for the land he was in such deep distress that he allowed his wife to persuade him to let the papers be drawn but when his children came into his presence in their poor apparel he felt like a traitor and refused to sign but now he was down again and deeper in the mire than ever he paced the floor all day he scarcely slept at night he blushed even to acknowledge it to himself but treason was in his mind he was meditating at last the sale of the land mrs hawkins stepped into the room he had not spoken a word but he felt as guilty as if she had caught him in some shameful act she said si i do not know what we are going to do the children are not fit to be seen their clothes are in such a state but theres something more serious still there is scarcely a bite in the house to eat why nancy go to johnson johnson indeed you took that mans part when he hadnt a friend in the world and you built him up and made him rich and heres the result of it he lives in our fine house and we live in his miserable log cabin he has hinted to our children that he would rather they wouldnt come about his yard to play with his children which i can bear and bear easy enough for theyre not a sort we want to associate with much but what i cant bear with any quietness at all is his telling franky our bill was running pretty high this morning when i sent him for some meal and that was all he said too didnt give him the meal turned off and went to talking with the hargrave girls about some stuff they wanted to cheapen nancy this is astounding and so it is i warrant you ive kept still si as long as ever i could things have been getting worse and worse and worse and worse every single day i dont go out of the house i feel so down but you had trouble enough and i wouldnt say a word and i wouldnt say a word now only things have got so bad that i dont know what to do nor where to turn and she gave way and put her face in her hands and cried poor child dont grieve so i never thought that of johnson i am clear at my wits end i dont know what in the world to do now if somebody would come along and offer uh if somebody only would come along and offer for that tennessee land youd sell it s said mrs hawkins excitedly try me mrs hawkins was out of the room in a moment within a minute she was back again with a businesslooking stranger whom she seated and then she took her leave again hawkins said to himself how can a man ever lose faith when the blackest hour comes providence always comes with it ah this is the very timeliest help that ever poor harried devil had if this blessed man offers but a thousand ill embrace him like a brother the stranger said i am aware that you own acres of land in east tennessee and without sacrificing your time i will come to the point at once i am agent of an iron manufacturing company and they empower me to offer you ten thousand dollars for that land hawkinss heart bounded within him his whole frame was racked and wrenched with fettered hurrahs his first impulse was to shout done and god bless the iron company too but a something flitted through his mind and his opened lips uttered nothing the enthusiasm faded away from his eyes and the look of a man who is thinking took its place presently in a hesitating undecided way he said well i it dont seem quite enough that that is a very valuable property very valuable its brim full of ironore sir brim full of it and copper coal everything everything you can think of now ill tell you what ill do ill reserve everything except the iron and ill sell them the iron property for cash i to go in with them and own an undivided interest of onehalf the concern or the stock as you may say im out of business and id just as soon help run the thing as not now how does that strike you well i am only an agent of these people who are friends of mine and i am not even paid for my services to tell you the truth i have tried to persuade them not to go into the thing and i have come square out with their offer without throwing out any feelers and i did it in the hope that you would refuse a man pretty much always refuses another mans first offer no matter what it is but i have performed my duty and will take pleasure in telling them what you say he was about to rise hawkins said wait a bit hawkins thought again and the substance of his thought was this is a deep man this is a very deep man i dont like his candor your ostentatiously candid business mans a deep fox always a deep fox this mans that iron company himself thats what he is he wants that property too i am not so blind but i can see that he dont want the company to go into this thing o thats very good yes thats very good indeed stuff hell be back here tomorrow sure and take my offer take it ill risk anything he is suffering to take it now here i must mind what im about what has started this sudden excitement about iron i wonder what is in the wind just as sure as im alive this moment theres something tremendous stirring in iron speculation here hawkins got up and began to pace the floor with excited eyes and with gesturing hands something enormous going on in iron without the shadow of a doubt and here i sit mousing in the dark and never knowing anything about it great heaven what an escape ive made this underhanded mercenary creature might have taken me up and ruined me but i have escaped and i warrant me ill not put my foot into he stopped and turned toward the stranger saying i have made you a proposition you have not accepted it and i desire that you will consider that i have made none at the same time my conscience will not allow me to please alter the figures i named to thirty thousand dollars if you will and let the proposition go to the company i will stick to it if it breaks my heart the stranger looked amused and there was a pretty well defined touch of surprise in his expression too but hawkins never noticed it indeed he scarcely noticed anything or knew what he was about the man left hawkins flung himself into a chair thought a few moments then glanced around looked frightened sprang to the door too late too late hes gone fool that i am always a fool thirty thousand ass that i am oh why didnt i say fifty thousand he plunged his hands into his hair and leaned his elbows on his knees and fell to rocking himself back and forth in anguish mrs hawkins sprang in beaming well si oh confound the confounded confound it nancy ive gone and done it now done what si for mercys sake done everything ruined everything tell me tell me tell me dont keep a body in such suspense didnt he buy after all didnt he make an offer offer he offered for our land and thank the good providence from the very bottom of my heart of hearts what sort of ruin do you call that si nancy do you suppose i listened to such a preposterous proposition no thank fortune im not a simpleton i saw through the pretty scheme in a second its a vast iron speculation millions upon millions in it but fool as i am i told him he could have half the iron property for thirty thousand and if i only had him back here he couldnt touch it for a cent less than a quarter of a million mrs hawkins looked up white and despairing you threw away this chance you let this man go and we in this awful trouble you dont mean it you cant mean it throw it away catch me at it why woman do you suppose that man dont know what he is about bless you hell be back fast enough tomorrow never never never he never will comeback i dont know what is to become of us i dont know what in the world is to become of us a shade of uneasiness came into hawkinss face he said why nancy you you cant believe what you are saying believe it indeed i know it si and i know that we havent a cent in the world and weve sent ten thousand dollars abegging nancy you frighten me now could that man is it possible that i hanged if i dont believe i have missed a chance dont grieve nancy dont grieve ill go right after him ill take ill take what a fool i am ill take anything hell give the next instant he left the house on a run but the man was no longer in the town nobody knew where he belonged or whither he had gone hawkins came slowly back watching wistfully but hopelessly for the stranger and lowering his price steadily with his sinking heart and when his foot finally pressed his own threshold the value he held the entire tennessee property at was five hundred dollars two hundred down and the rest in three equal annual payments without interest there was a sad gathering at the hawkins fireside the next night all the children were present but clay mr hawkins said washington we seem to be hopelessly fallen hopelessly involved i am ready to give up i do not know where to turn i never have been down so low before i never have seen things so dismal there are many mouths to feed clay is at work we must lose you also for a little while my boy but it will not be long the tennessee land he stopped and was conscious of a blush there was silence for a moment and then washington now a lank dreamyeyed stripling between twentytwo and twentythree years of age said if col sellers would come for me i would go and stay with him a while till the tennessee land is sold he has often wanted me to come ever since he moved to hawkeye im afraid he cant well come for you washington from what i can hear not from him of course but from others he is not far from as bad off as we are and his family is as large too he might find something for you to do maybe but youd better try to get to him yourself washington its only thirty miles but how can i father theres no stage or anything and if there were stages require money a stage goes from swansea five miles from here but it would be cheaper to walk father they must know you there and no doubt they would credit you in a moment for a little stage ride like that couldnt you write and ask them couldnt you washington seeing its you that wants the ride and what do you think youll do washington when you get to hawkeye finish your invention for making windowglass opaque no sir i have given that up i almost knew i could do it but it was so tedious and troublesome i quit it i was afraid of it my boy then i suppose youll finish your plan of coloring hens eggs by feeding a peculiar diet to the hen no sir i believe i have found out the stuff that will do it but it kills the hen so i have dropped that for the present though i can take it up again some day when i learn how to manage the mixture better well what have you got on hand anything yes sir three or four things i think they are all good and can all be done but they are tiresome and besides they require money but as soon as the land is sold emily were you about to say something said hawkins yes sir if you are willing i will go to st louis that will make another mouth less to feed mrs buckner has always wanted me to come but the money child why i think she would send it if you would write her and i know she would wait for her pay till come laura lets hear from you my girl emily and laura were about the same age between seventeen and eighteen emily was fair and pretty girlish and diffident blue eyes and light hair laura had a proud bearing and a somewhat mature look she had fine cleancut features her complexion was pure white and contrasted vividly with her black hair and eyes she was not what one calls pretty she was beautiful she said i will go to st louis too sir i will find a way to get there i will make a way and i will find a way to help myself along and do what i can to help the rest too she spoke it like a princess mrs hawkins smiled proudly and kissed her saying in a tone of fond reproof so one of my girls is going to turn out and work for her living its like your pluck and spirit child but we will hope that we havent got quite down to that yet the girls eyes beamed affection under her mothers caress then she straightened up folded her white hands in her lap and became a splendid iceberg clays dog put up his brown nose for a little attention and got it he retired under the table with an apologetic yelp which did not affect the iceberg judge hawkins had written and asked clay to return home and consult with him upon family affairs he arrived the evening after this conversation and the whole household gave him a rapturous welcome he brought sadly needed help with him consisting of the savings of a year and a half of work nearly two hundred dollars in money it was a ray of sunshine which to this easy household was the earnest of a clearing sky bright and early in the morning the family were astir and all were busy preparing washington for his journey at least all but washington himself who sat apart steeped in a reverie when the time for his departure came it was easy to see how fondly all loved him and how hard it was to let him go notwithstanding they had often seen him go before in his st louis schooling days in the most matterofcourse way they had borne the burden of getting him ready for his trip never seeming to think of his helping in the matter in the same matterofcourse way clay had hired a horse and cart and now that the goodbyes were ended he bundled washingtons baggage in and drove away with the exile at swansea clay paid his stage fare stowed him away in the vehicle and saw him off then he returned home and reported progress like a committee of the whole clay remained at home several days he held many consultations with his mother upon the financial condition of the family and talked once with his father upon the same subject but only once he found a change in that quarter which was distressing years of fluctuating fortune had done their work each reverse had weakened the fathers spirit and impaired his energies his last misfortune seemed to have left hope and ambition dead within him he had no projects formed no plans evidently he was a vanquished man he looked worn and tired he inquired into clays affairs and prospects and when he found that clay was doing pretty well and was likely to do still better it was plain that he resigned himself with easy facility to look to the son for a support and he said keep yourself informed of poor washingtons condition and movements and help him along all you can clay the younger children also seemed relieved of all fears and distresses and very ready and willing to look to clay for a livelihood within three days a general tranquility and satisfaction reigned in the household clays hundred and eighty or ninety dollars had worked a wonder the family were as contented now and as free from care as they could have been with a fortune it was well that mrs hawkins held the purse otherwise the treasure would have lasted but a very little while it took but a trifle to pay hawkinss outstanding obligations for he had always had a horror of debt when clay bade his home goodbye and set out to return to the field of his labors he was conscious that henceforth he was to have his fathers family on his hands as pensioners but he did not allow himself to chafe at the thought for he reasoned that his father had dealt by him with a free hand and a loving one all his life and now that hard fortune had broken his spirit it ought to be a pleasure not a pain to work for him the younger children were born and educated dependents they had never been taught to do anything for themselves and it did not seem to occur to them to make an attempt now the girls would not have been permitted to work for a living under any circumstances whatever it was a southern family and of good blood and for any person except laura either within or without the household to have suggested such an idea would have brought upon the suggester the suspicion of being a lunatic chapter vii via pecunia when shes run and gone and fled and dead then will i fetch her again with aqua vita out of an old hogshead while there are lees of wine or dregs of beer ill never want her coin her out of cobwebs dust but ill have her raise wool upon eggshells sir and make grass grow out of marrowbones to make her come b jonson bearing washington hawkins and his fortunes the stagecoach tore out of swansea at a fearful gait with horn tooting gaily and half the town admiring from doors and windows but it did not tear any more after it got to the outskirts it dragged along stupidly enough then till it came in sight of the next hamlet and then the bugle tooted gaily again and again the vehicle went tearing by the horses this sort of conduct marked every entry to a station and every exit from it and so in those days children grew up with the idea that stagecoaches always tore and always tooted but they also grew up with the idea that pirates went into action in their sunday clothes carrying the black flag in one hand and pistolling people with the other merely because they were so represented in the pictures but these illusions vanished when later years brought their disenchanting wisdom they learned then that the stagecoach is but a poor plodding vulgar thing in the solitudes of the highway and that the pirate is only a seedy unfantastic rough when he is out of the pictures toward evening the stagecoach came thundering into hawkeye with a perfectly triumphant ostentation which was natural and proper for hawkey a was a pretty large town for interior missouri washington very stiff and tired and hungry climbed out and wondered how he was to proceed now but his difficulty was quickly solved col sellers came down the street on a run and arrived panting for breath he said lord bless you im glad to see you washington perfectly delighted to see you my boy i got your message been on the lookout for you heard the stage horn but had a party i couldnt shake off man thats got an enormous thing on hand wants me to put some capital into it and i tell you my boy i could do worse i could do a deal worse no now let that luggage alone ill fix that here jerry got anything to do all rightshoulder this plunder and follow me come along washington lord im glad to see you wife and the children are just perishing to look at you bless you they wont know you youve grown so folks all well i suppose thats good glad to hear that were always going to run down and see them but im into so many operations and theyre not things a man feels like trusting to other people and so somehow we keep putting it off fortunes in them good gracious its the country to pile up wealth in here we are heres where the sellers dynasty hangs out hump it on the doorstep jerry the blackest niggro in the state washington but got a good heart mighty likely boy is jerry and now i suppose youve got to have ten cents jerry thats all right when a man works for me when a man in the other pocket i reckon when a man why where the mischief as that portmonnaie when a well now thats odd oh now i remember must have left it at the bank and bgeorge ive left my checkbook too polly says i ought to have a nurse well no matter let me have a dime washington if youve got ah thanks now clear out jerry your complexion has brought on the twilight half an hour ahead of time pretty fair joke pretty fair here he is polly washingtons come children come now dont eat him up finish him in the house welcome my boy to a mansion that is proud to shelter the son of the best man that walks on the ground si hawkins has been a good friend to me and i believe i can say that whenever ive had a chance to put him into a good thing ive done it and done it pretty cheerfully too i put him into that sugar speculation what a grand thing that was if we hadnt held on too long true enough but holding on too long had utterly ruined both of them and the saddest part of it was that they never had had so much money to lose before for sellerss sale of their mule crop that year in new orleans had been a great financial success if he had kept out of sugar and gone back home content to stick to mules it would have been a happy wisdom as it was he managed to kill two birds with one stone that is to say he killed the sugar speculation by holding for high rates till he had to sell at the bottom figure and that calamity killed the mule that laid the golden egg which is but a figurative expression and will be so understood sellers had returned home cheerful but emptyhanded and the mule business lapsed into other hands the sale of the hawkins property by the sheriff had followed and the hawkins hearts been torn to see uncle danl and his wife pass from the auctionblock into the hands of a negro trader and depart for the remote south to be seen no more by the family it had seemed like seeing their own flesh and blood sold into banishment washington was greatly pleased with the sellers mansion it was a twostoryandahalf brick and much more stylish than any of its neighbors he was borne to the family sitting room in triumph by the swarm of little sellerses the parents following with their arms about each others waists the whole family were poorly and cheaply dressed and the clothing although neat and clean showed many evidences of having seen long service the colonels stovepipe hat was napless and shiny with much polishing but nevertheless it had an almost convincing expression about it of having been just purchased new the rest of his clothing was napless and shiny too but it had the air of being entirely satisfied with itself and blandly sorry for other peoples clothes it was growing rather dark in the house and the evening air was chilly too sellers said lay off your overcoat washington and draw up to the stove and make yourself at home just consider yourself under your own shingles my boy ill have a fire going in a jiffy light the lamp polly dear and lets have things cheerful just as glad to see you washington as if youd been lost a century and wed found you again by this time the colonel was conveying a lighted match into a poor little stove then he propped the stove door to its place by leaning the poker against it for the hinges had retired from business this door framed a small square of isinglass which now warmed up with a faint glow mrs sellers lit a cheap showy lamp which dissipated a good deal of the gloom and then everybody gathered into the light and took the stove into close companionship the children climbed all over sellers fondled him petted him and were lavishly petted in return out from this tugging laughing chattering disguise of legs and arms and little faces the colonels voice worked its way and his tireless tongue ran blithely on without interruption and the purring little wife diligent with her knitting sat near at hand and looked happy and proud and grateful and she listened as one who listens to oracles and gospels and whose grateful soul is being refreshed with the bread of life bye and bye the children quieted down to listen clustered about their father and resting their elbows on his legs they hung upon his words as if he were uttering the music of the spheres a dreary old haircloth sofa against the wall a few damaged chairs the small table the lamp stood on the crippled stove these things constituted the furniture of the room there was no carpet on the floor on the wall were occasional squareshaped interruptions of the general tint of the plaster which betrayed that there used to be pictures in the house but there were none now there were no mantel ornaments unless one might bring himself to regard as an ornament a clock which never came within fifteen strokes of striking the right time and whose hands always hitched together at twentytwo minutes past anything and traveled in company the rest of the way home remarkable clock said sellers and got up and wound it ive been offered well i wouldnt expect you to believe what ive been offered for that clock old gov hager never sees me but he says come now colonel name your price i must have that clock but my goodness id as soon think of selling my wife as i was saying to silence in the court now shes begun to strike you cant talk against her you have to just be patient and hold up till shes said her say ah well as i was saying when shes beginning again nineteen twenty twentyone twentytwo twenah thats all yes as i was saying to old judge go it old girl dont mind me now how is thatisnt that a good spirited tone she can wake the dead sleep why you might as well try to sleep in a thunderfactory now just listen at that shell strike a hundred and fifty now without stopping youll see there aint another clock like that in christendom washington hoped that this might be true for the din was distracting though the family one and all seemed filled with joy and the more the clock buckled down to her work as the colonel expressed it and the more insupportable the clatter became the more enchanted they all appeared to be when there was silence mrs sellers lifted upon washington a face that beamed with a childlike pride and said it belonged to his grandmother the look and the tone were a plain call for admiring surprise and therefore washington said it was the only thing that offered itself at the moment indeed yes it did didnt it father exclaimed one of the twins she was my greatgrandmother and georges too wasnt she father you never saw her but sis has seen her when sis was a babydidnt you sis sis has seen her most a hundred times she was awful deef shes dead now aint she father all the children chimed in now with one general babel of information about deceased nobody offering to read the riot act or seeming to discountenance the insurrection or disapprove of it in any way but the head twin drowned all the turmoil and held his own against the field its our clock now and its got wheels inside of it and a thing that flutters every time she strikes dont it father greatgrandmother died before hardly any of us was born she was an oldschool baptist and had warts all over her you ask father if she didnt she had an uncle once that was baldheaded and used to have fits he wasnt our uncle i dont know what he was to us some kin or another i reckon fathers seen him a thousand times haint you father we used to have a calf that et apples and just chawed up dishrags like nothing and if you stay here youll see lots of funerals wont he sis did you ever see a house afire i have once me and jim terry but sellers began to speak now and the storm ceased he began to tell about an enormous speculation he was thinking of embarking some capital in a speculation which some london bankers had been over to consult with him about and soon he was building glittering pyramids of coin and washington was presently growing opulent under the magic of his eloquence but at the same time washington was not able to ignore the cold entirely he was nearly as close to the stove as he could get and yet he could not persuade himself that he felt the slightest heat notwithstanding the isinglass door was still gently and serenely glowing he tried to get a trifle closer to the stove and the consequence was he tripped the supporting poker and the stovedoor tumbled to the floor and then there was a revelation there was nothing in the stove but a lighted tallowcandle the poor youth blushed and felt as if he must die with shame but the colonel was only disconcerted for a moment he straightway found his voice again a little idea of my own washington one of the greatest things in the world you must write and tell your father about it dont forget that now i have been reading up some european scientific reports friend of mine count fugier sent them to me sends me all sorts of things from paris he thinks the world of me fugier does well i saw that the academy of france had been testing the properties of heat and they came to the conclusion that it was a nonconductor or something like that and of course its influence must necessarily be deadly in nervous organizations with excitable temperaments especially where there is any tendency toward rheumatic affections bless you i saw in a moment what was the matter with us and says i out goes your fires no more slow torture and certain death for me sir what you want is the appearance of heat not the heat itself thats the idea well how to do it was the next thing i just put my head to work pegged away a couple of days and here you are rheumatism why a man cant any more start a case of rheumatism in this house than he can shake an opinion out of a mummy stove with a candle in it and a transparent door thats it it has been the salvation of this family dont you fail to write your father about it washington and tell him the idea is mine im no more conceited than most people i reckon but you know it is human nature for a man to want credit for a thing like that washington said with his blue lips that he would but he said in his secret heart that he would promote no such iniquity he tried to believe in the healthfulness of the invention and succeeded tolerably well but after all he could not feel that good health in a frozen body was any real improvement on the rheumatism chapter viii whan pe horde is thynne as of seruyse nought replenesshed with grete diuersite of mete drinke good chere may then suffise with honest talkyng the book of curtesye mammon come on sir now you set your foot on shore in novo orbe heres the rich peru and there within sir are the golden mines great solomons ophir b jonson the supper at col sellerss was not sumptuous in the beginning but it improved on acquaintance that is to say that what washington regarded at first sight as mere lowly potatoes presently became aweinspiring agricultural productions that had been reared in some ducal garden beyond the sea under the sacred eye of the duke himself who had sent them to sellers the bread was from corn which could be grown in only one favored locality in the earth and only a favored few could get it the rio coffee which at first seemed execrable to the taste took to itself an improved flavor when washington was told to drink it slowly and not hurry what should be a lingering luxury in order to be fully appreciated it was from the private stores of a brazilian nobleman with an unrememberable name the colonels tongue was a magicians wand that turned dried apples into figs and water into wine as easily as it could change a hovel into a palace and present poverty into imminent future riches washington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a palace in the morning at least the palace lingered during the moment that he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings and then it disappeared and he recognized that the colonels inspiring talk had been influencing his dreams fatigue had made him sleep late when he entered the sitting room he noticed that the old haircloth sofa was absent when he sat down to breakfast the colonel tossed six or seven dollars in bills on the table counted them over said he was a little short and must call upon his banker then returned the bills to his wallet with the indifferent air of a man who is used to money the breakfast was not an improvement upon the supper but the colonel talked it up and transformed it into an oriental feast bye and bye he said i intend to look out for you washington my boy i hunted up a place for you yesterday but i am not referring to that now that is a mere livelihood mere bread and butter but when i say i mean to look out for you i mean something very different i mean to put things in your way than will make a mere livelihood a trifling thing ill put you in a way to make more money than youll ever know what to do with youll be right here where i can put my hand on you when anything turns up ive got some prodigious operations on foot but im keeping quiet mums the word your old hand dont go around powwowing and letting everybody see his kyards and find out his little game but all in good time washington all in good time youll see now theres an operation in corn that looks well some new york men are trying to get me to go into it buy up all the growing crops and just boss the market when they mature ah i tell you its a great thing and it only costs a trifle two millions or two and a half will do it i havent exactly promised yet theres no hurry the more indifferent i seem you know the more anxious those fellows will get and then there is the hog speculation thats bigger still weve got quiet men at work he was very impressive here mousing around to get propositions out of all the farmers in the whole west and northwest for the hog crop and other agents quietly getting propositions and terms out of all the manufactories and dont you see if we can get all the hogs and all the slaughter horses into our hands on the dead quiet whew it would take three ships to carry the money ive looked into the thing calculated all the chances for and all the chances against and though i shake my head and hesitate and keep on thinking apparently ive got my mind made up that if the thing can be done on a capital of six millions thats the horse to put up money on why washington but whats the use of talking about it any man can see that theres whole atlantic oceans of cash in it gulfs and bays thrown in but theres a bigger thing than that yes bigger why colonel you cant want anything bigger said washington his eyes blazing oh i wish i could go into either of those speculations i only wish i had money i wish i wasnt cramped and kept down and fettered with poverty and such prodigious chances lying right here in sight oh it is a fearful thing to be poor but dont throw away those things they are so splendid and i can see how sure they are dont throw them away for something still better and maybe fail in it i wouldnt colonel i would stick to these i wish father were here and were his old self again oh he never in his life had such chances as these are colonel you cant improve on these no man can improve on them a sweet compassionate smile played about the colonels features and he leaned over the table with the air of a man who is going to show you and do it without the least trouble why washington my boy these things are nothing they look large of course they look large to a novice but to a man who has been all his life accustomed to large operations shaw theyre well enough to while away an idle hour with or furnish a bit of employment that will give a trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting for something to do but now just listen a moment just let me give you an idea of what we old veterans of commerce call business heres the rothschilds proposition this is between you and me you understand washington nodded three or four times impatiently and his glowing eyes said yes yes hurry i understand for i wouldnt have it get out for a fortune they want me to go in with them on the sly agent was here two weeks ago about it go in on the sly voice down to an impressive whisper now and buy up a hundred and thirteen wild cat banks in ohio indiana kentucky illinois and missouri notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount now average discount of the hundred and thirteen is fortyfour per cent buy them all up you see and then all of a sudden let the cat out of the bag whiz the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin up to a tremendous premium before you could turn a handspring profit on the speculation not a dollar less than forty millions an eloquent pause while the marvelous vision settled into ws focus wheres your hogs now why my dear innocent boy we would just sit down on the front doorsteps and peddle banks like lucifer matches washington finally got his breath and said oh it is perfectly wonderful why couldnt these things have happened in fathers day and i its of no use they simply lie before my face and mock me there is nothing for me but to stand helpless and see other people reap the astonishing harvest never mind washington dont you worry ill fix you theres plenty of chances how much money have you got in the presence of so many millions washington could not keep from blushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the world well all right dont despair other people have been obliged to begin with less i have a small idea that may develop into something for us both all in good time keep your money close and add to it ill make it breed ive been experimenting to pass away the time on a little preparation for curing sore eyes a kind of decoction ninetenths water and the other tenth drugs that dont cost more than a dollar a barrel im still experimenting theres one ingredient wanted yet to perfect the thing and somehow i cant just manage to hit upon the thing thats necessary and i dont dare talk with a chemist of course but im progressing and before many weeks i wager the country will ring with the fame of beriah sellers infallible imperial oriental optic liniment and salvation for sore eyes the medical wonder of the age small bottles fifty cents large ones a dollar average cost five and seven cents for the two sizes the first year sell say ten thousand bottles in missouri seven thousand in iowa three thousand in arkansas four thousand in kentucky six thousand in illinois and say twentyfive thousand in the rest of the country total fifty five thousand bottles profit clear of all expenses twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation all the capital needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles say a hundred and fifty dollars then the money would begin to flow in the second year sales would reach bottles clear profit say and in the meantime the great factory would be building in st louis to cost say the third year we could easily sell bottles in the united states and o splendid said washington lets commence right away lets bottles in the united states profit at least and then it would begin to be time to turn our attention toward the real idea of the business the real idea of it aint a year a pretty real stuff why what an infant you are washington what a guileless shortsighted easilycontented innocent you are my poor little countrybred knownothing would i go to all that trouble and bother for the poor crumbs a body might pick up in this country now do i look like a man whodoes my history suggest that i am a man who deals in trifles contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the common herd sees no further than the end of his nose now you know that that is not me couldnt be me you ought to know that if i throw my time and abilities into a patent medicine its a patent medicine whose field of operations is the solid earth its clients the swarming nations that inhabit it why what is the republic of america for an eyewater country lord bless you it is nothing but a barren highway that youve got to cross to get to the true eyewater market why washington in the oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert every square mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling human creatures and every separate and individual devil of thems got the ophthalmia its as natural to them as noses are and sin its born with them it stays with them its all that some of them have left when they die three years of introductory trade in the orient and what will be the result why our headquarters would be in constantinople and our hindquarters in further india factories and warehouses in cairo ispahan bagdad damascus jerusalem yedo peking bangkok delhi bombay and calcutta annual income well god only knows how many millions and millions apiece washington was so dazed so bewildered his heart and his eyes had wandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas and such avalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly down before him that he was now as one who has been whirling round and round for a time and stopping all at once finds his surroundings still whirling and all objects a dancing chaos however little by little the sellers family cooled down and crystalized into shape and the poor room lost its glitter and resumed its poverty then the youth found his voice and begged sellers to drop everything and hurry up the eyewater and he got his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon the colonel pleaded with him to take it implored him to do it but the colonel would not said he would not need the capital in his native magnificent way he called that eighteen dollars capital till the eyewater was an accomplished fact he made washington easy in his mind though by promising that he would call for it just as soon as the invention was finished and he added the glad tidings that nobody but just they two should be admitted to a share in the speculation when washington left the breakfast table he could have worshiped that man washington was one of that kind of people whose hopes are in the very clouds one day and in the gutter the next he walked on air now the colonel was ready to take him around and introduce him to the employment he had found for him but washington begged for a few moments in which to write home with his kind of people to ride todays new interest to death and put off yesterdays till another time is nature itself he ran up stairs and wrote glowingly enthusiastically to his mother about the hogs and the corn the banks and the eyewater and added a few inconsequential millions to each project and he said that people little dreamed what a man col sellers was and that the world would open its eyes when it found out and he closed his letter thus so make yourself perfectly easy motherin a little while you shall have everything you want and more i am not likely to stint you in anything i fancy this money will not be for me alone but for all of us i want all to share alike and there is going to be far more for each than one person can spend break it to father cautiously you understand the need of that break it to him cautiously for he has had such cruel hard fortune and is so stricken by it that great good news might prostrate him more surely than even bad for he is used to the bad but is grown sadly unaccustomed to the other tell laura tell all the children and write to clay about it if he is not with you yet you may tell clay that whatever i get he can freely share infreely he knows that that is true there will be no need that i should swear to that to make him believe it goodbye and mind what i say rest perfectly easy one and all of you for our troubles are nearly at an end poor lad he could not know that his mother would cry some loving compassionate tears over his letter and put off the family with a synopsis of its contents which conveyed a deal of love to then but not much idea of his prospects or projects and he never dreamed that such a joyful letter could sadden her and fill her night with sighs and troubled thoughts and bodings of the future instead of filling it with peace and blessing it with restful sleep when the letter was done washington and the colonel sallied forth and as they walked along washington learned what he was to be he was to be a clerk in a real estate office instantly the fickle youths dreams forsook the magic eyewater and flew back to the tennessee land and the gorgeous possibilities of that great domain straightway began to occupy his imagination to such a degree that he could scarcely manage to keep even enough of his attention upon the colonels talk to retain the general run of what he was saying he was glad it was a real estate office he was a made man now sure the colonel said that general boswell was a rich man and had a good and growing business and that washingtons work world be light and he would get forty dollars a month and be boarded and lodged in the generals family which was as good as ten dollars more and even better for he could not live as well even at the city hotel as he would there and yet the hotel charged fifteen dollars a month where a man had a good room general boswell was in his office a comfortable looking place with plenty of outline maps hanging about the walls and in the windows and a spectacled man was marking out another one on a long table the office was in the principal street the general received washington with a kindly but reserved politeness washington rather liked his looks he was about fifty years old dignified well preserved and well dressed after the colonel took his leave the general talked a while with washington his talk consisting chiefly of instructions about the clerical duties of the place he seemed satisfied as to washingtons ability to take care of the books he was evidently a pretty fair theoretical bookkeeper and experience would soon harden theory into practice by and by dinnertime came and the two walked to the generals house and now washington noticed an instinct in himself that moved him to keep not in the generals rear exactly but yet not at his side somehow the old gentlemans dignity and reserve did not inspire familiarity chapter ix washington dreamed his way along the street his fancy flitting from grain to hogs from hogs to banks from banks to eyewater from eyewater to tennessee land and lingering but a feverish moment upon each of these fascinations he was conscious of but one outward thing to wit the general and he was really not vividly conscious of him arrived at the finest dwelling in the town they entered it and were at home washington was introduced to mrs boswell and his imagination was on the point of flitting into the vapory realms of speculation again when a lovely girl of sixteen or seventeen came in this vision swept washingtons mind clear of its chaos of glittering rubbish in an instant beauty had fascinated him before many times he had been in love even for weeks at a time with the same object but his heart had never suffered so sudden and so fierce an assault as this within his recollection louise boswell occupied his mind and drifted among his multiplication tables all the afternoon he was constantly catching himself in a reverie reveries made up of recalling how she looked when she first burst upon him how her voice thrilled him when she first spoke how charmed the very air seemed by her presence blissful as the afternoon was delivered up to such a revel as this it seemed an eternity so impatient was he to see the girl again other afternoons like it followed washington plunged into this love affair as he plunged into everything else upon impulse and without reflection as the days went by it seemed plain that he was growing in favor with louise not sweepingly so but yet perceptibly he fancied his attentions to her troubled her father and mother a little and they warned louise without stating particulars or making allusions to any special person that a girl was sure to make a mistake who allowed herself to marry anybody but a man who could support her well some instinct taught washington that his present lack of money would be an obstruction though possibly not a bar to his hopes and straightway his poverty became a torture to him which cast all his former sufferings under that held into the shade he longed for riches now as he had ever longed for them before he had been once or twice to dine with col sellers and had been discouraged to note that the colonels bill of fare was falling off both in quantity and quality a sign he feared that the lacking ingredient in the eyewater still remained undiscovered though sellers always explained that these changes in the family diet had been ordered by the doctor or suggested by some new scientific work the colonel had stumbled upon but it always turned out that the lacking ingredient was still lacking though it always appeared at the same time that the colonel was right on its heels every time the colonel came into the real estate office washingtons heart bounded and his eyes lighted with hope but it always turned out that the colonel was merely on the scent of some vast undefined landed speculation although he was customarily able to say that he was nearer to the allnecessary ingredient than ever and could almost name the hour when success would dawn and then washingtons heart world sink again and a sigh would tell when it touched bottom about this time a letter came saying that judge hawkins had been ailing for a fortnight and was now considered to be seriously ill it was thought best that washington should come home the news filled him with grief for he loved and honored his father the boswells were touched by the youths sorrow and even the general unbent and said encouraging things to him there was balm in this but when louise bade him goodbye and shook his hand and said dont be cast down it will all come out right i know it will all come out right it seemed a blessed thing to be in misfortune and the tears that welled up to his eyes were the messengers of an adoring and a grateful heart and when the girl saw them and answering tears came into her own eyes washington could hardly contain the excess of happiness that poured into the cavities of his breast that were so lately stored to the roof with grief all the way home he nursed his woe and exalted it he pictured himself as she must be picturing him a noble struggling young spirit persecuted by misfortune but bravely and patiently waiting in the shadow of a dread calamity and preparing to meet the blow as became one who was all too used to hard fortune and the pitiless buffetings of fate these thoughts made him weep and weep more brokenheartedly than ever and be wished that she could see his sufferings now there was nothing significant in the fact that louise dreamy and distraught stood at her bedroom bureau that night scribbling washington here and there over a sheet of paper but there was something significant in the fact that she scratched the word out every time she wrote it examined the erasure critically to see if anybody could guess at what the word had been then buried it under a maze of obliterating lines and finally as if still unsatisfied burned the paper when washington reached home he recognized at once how serious his fathers case was the darkened room the labored breathing and occasional moanings of the patient the tiptoeing of the attendants and their whispered consultations were full of sad meaning for three or four nights mrs hawkins and laura had been watching by the bedside clay had arrived preceding washington by one day and he was now added to the corps of watchers mr hawkins would have none but these three though neighborly assistance was offered by old friends from this time forth threehour watches were instituted and day and night the watchers kept their vigils by degrees laura and her mother began to show wear but neither of them would yield a minute of their tasks to clay he ventured once to let the midnight hour pass without calling laura but he ventured no more there was that about her rebuke when he tried to explain that taught him that to let her sleep when she might be ministering to her fathers needs was to rob her of moments that were priceless in her eyes he perceived that she regarded it as a privilege to watch not a burden and he had noticed also that when midnight struck the patient turned his eyes toward the door with an expectancy in them which presently grew into a longing but brightened into contentment as soon as the door opened and laura appeared and he did not need lauras rebuke when he heard his father say clay is good and you are tired poor child but i wanted you so clay is not good father he did not call me i would not have treated him so how could you do it clay clay begged forgiveness and promised not to break faith again and as he betook him to his bed he said to himself its a steadfast little soul whoever thinks he is doing the duchess a kindness by intimating that she is not sufficient for any undertaking she puts her hand to makes a mistake and if i did not know it before i know now that there are surer ways of pleasing her than by trying to lighten her labor when that labor consists in wearing herself out for the sake of a person she loves a week drifted by and all the while the patient sank lower and lower the night drew on that was to end all suspense it was a wintry one the darkness gathered the snow was falling the wind wailed plaintively about the house or shook it with fitful gusts the doctor had paid his last visit and gone away with that dismal remark to the nearest friend of the family that he believed there was nothing more that he could do a remark which is always overheard by some one it is not meant for and strikes a lingering halfconscious hope dead with a withering shock the medicine phials had been removed from the bedside and put out of sight and all things made orderly and meet for the solemn event that was impending the patient with closed eyes lay scarcely breathing the watchers sat by and wiped the gathering damps from his forehead while the silent tears flowed down their faces the deep hush was only interrupted by sobs from the children grouped about the bed after a time it was toward midnight now mr hawkins roused out of a doze looked about him and was evidently trying to speak instantly laura lifted his head and in a failing voice he said while something of the old light shone in his eyes wife children come nearer nearer the darkness grows let me see you all once more the group closed together at the bedside and their tears and sobs came now without restraint i am leaving you in cruel poverty i have been so foolish so shortsighted but courage a better day is is coming never lose sight of the tennessee land be wary there is wealth stored up for you there wealth that is boundless the children shall hold up their heads with the best in the land yet where are the papers have you got the papers safe show them show them to me under his strong excitement his voice had gathered power and his last sentences were spoken with scarcely a perceptible halt or hindrance with an effort he had raised himself almost without assistance to a sitting posture but now the fire faded out of his eyes and be fell back exhausted the papers were brought and held before him and the answering smile that flitted across his face showed that he was satisfied he closed his eyes and the signs of approaching dissolution multiplied rapidly he lay almost motionless for a little while then suddenly partly raised his head and looked about him as one who peers into a dim uncertain light he muttered gone no i see you still it is it isover but you are safe safe the ten the voice died out in a whisper the sentence was never finished the emaciated fingers began to pick at the coverlet a fatal sign after a time there were no sounds but the cries of the mourners within and the gusty turmoil of the wind without laura had bent down and kissed her fathers lips as the spirit left the body but she did not sob or utter any ejaculation her tears flowed silently then she closed the dead eyes and crossed the hands upon the breast after a season she kissed the forehead reverently drew the sheet up over the face and then walked apart and sat down with the look of one who is done with life and has no further interest in its joys and sorrows its hopes or its ambitions clay buried his face in the coverlet of the bed when the other children and the mother realized that death was indeed come at last they threw themselves into each others arms and gave way to a frenzy of grief chapter x only two or three days had elapsed since the funeral when something happened which was to change the drift of lauras life somewhat and influence in a greater or lesser degree the formation of her character major lackland had once been a man of note in the state a man of extraordinary natural ability and as extraordinary learning he had been universally trusted and honored in his day but had finally fallen into misfortune while serving his third term in congress and while upon the point of being elevated to the senate which was considered the summit of earthly aggrandizement in those days he had yielded to temptation when in distress for money wherewith to save his estate and sold his vote his crime was discovered and his fall followed instantly nothing could reinstate him in the confidence of the people his ruin was irretrievable his disgrace complete all doors were closed against him all men avoided him after years of skulking retirement and dissipation death had relieved him of his troubles at last and his funeral followed close upon that of mr hawkins he died as he had latterly lived wholly alone and friendless he had no relatives or if he had they did not acknowledge him the coroners jury found certain memoranda upon his body and about the premises which revealed a fact not suspected by the villagers beforeviz that laura was not the child of mr and mrs hawkins the gossips were soon at work they were but little hampered by the fact that the memoranda referred to betrayed nothing but the bare circumstance that lauras real parents were unknown and stopped there so far from being hampered by this the gossips seemed to gain all the more freedom from it they supplied all the missing information themselves they filled up all the blanks the town soon teemed with histories of lauras origin and secret history no two versions precisely alike but all elaborate exhaustive mysterious and interesting and all agreeing in one vital particulartowit that there was a suspicious cloud about her birth not to say a disreputable one laura began to encounter cold looks averted eyes and peculiar nods and gestures which perplexed her beyond measure but presently the pervading gossip found its way to her and she understood them then her pride was stung she was astonished and at first incredulous she was about to ask her mother if there was any truth in these reports but upon second thought held her peace she soon gathered that major lacklands memoranda seemed to refer to letters which had passed between himself and judge hawkins she shaped her course without difficulty the day that that hint reached her that night she sat in her room till all was still and then she stole into the garret and began a search she rummaged long among boxes of musty papers relating to business matters of no interest to her but at last she found several bundles of letters one bundle was marked private and in that she found what she wanted she selected six or eight letters from the package and began to devour their contents heedless of the cold by the dates these letters were from five to seven years old they were all from major lackland to mr hawkins the substance of them was that some one in the east had been inquiring of major lackland about a lost child and its parents and that it was conjectured that the child might be laura evidently some of the letters were missing for the name of the inquirer was not mentioned there was a casual reference to this handsomefeatured aristocratic gentleman as if the reader and the writer were accustomed to speak of him and knew who was meant in one letter the major said he agreed with mr hawkins that the inquirer seemed not altogether on the wrong track but he also agreed that it would be best to keep quiet until more convincing developments were forthcoming another letter said that the poor soul broke completely down when be saw lauras picture and declared it must be she still another said he seems entirely alone in the world and his heart is so wrapped up in this thing that i believe that if it proved a false hope it would kill him i have persuaded him to wait a little while and go west when i go another letter had this paragraph in it he is better one day and worse the next and is out of his mind a good deal of the time lately his case has developed a something which is a wonder to the hired nurses but which will not be much of a marvel to you if you have read medical philosophy much it is this his lost memory returns to him when he is delirious and goes away again when he is himselfjust as old canada joe used to talk the french patois of his boyhood in the delirium of typhus fever though he could not do it when his mind was clear now this poor gentlemans memory has always broken down before he reached the explosion of the steamer he could only remember starting up the river with his wife and child and he had an idea that there was a race but he was not certain he could not name the boat he was on there was a dead blank of a month or more that supplied not an item to his recollection it was not for me to assist him of course but now in his delirium it all comes out the names of the boats every incident of the explosion and likewise the details of his astonishing escape that is up to where just as a yawlboat was approaching him he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the burning wreck at the time a falling timber struck him on the head but i will write out his wonderful escape in full tomorrow or next day of course the physicians will not let me tell him now that our laura is indeed his child that must come later when his health is thoroughly restored his case is not considered dangerous at all he will recover presently the doctors say but they insist that he must travel a little when he gets well they recommend a short sea voyage and they say he can be persuaded to try it if we continue to keep him in ignorance and promise to let him see l as soon as he returns the letter that bore the latest date of all contained this clause it is the most unaccountable thing in the world the mystery remains as impenetrable as ever i have hunted high and low for him and inquired of everybody but in vain all trace of him ends at that hotel in new york i never have seen or heard of him since up to this day he could hardly have sailed for his name does not appear upon the books of any shipping office in new york or boston or baltimore how fortunate it seems now that we kept this thing to ourselves laura still has a father in you and it is better for her that we drop this subject here forever that was all random remarks here and there being pieced together gave laura a vague impression of a man of fine presence abort fortythree or fortyfive years of age with dark hair and eyes and a slight limp in his walk it was not stated which leg was defective and this indistinct shadow represented her father she made an exhaustive search for the missing letters but found none they had probably been burned and she doubted not that the ones she had ferreted out would have shared the same fate if mr hawkins had not been a dreamer void of method whose mind was perhaps in a state of conflagration over some bright new speculation when he received them she sat long with the letters in her lap thinking and unconsciously freezing she felt like a lost person who has traveled down a long lane in good hope of escape and just as the night descends finds his progress barred by a bridgeless river whose further shore if it has one is lost in the darkness if she could only have found these letters a month sooner that was her thought but now the dead had carried their secrets with them a dreary melancholy settled down upon her an undefined sense of injury crept into her heart she grew very miserable she had just reached the romantic age the age when there is a sad sweetness a dismal comfort to a girl to find out that there is a mystery connected with her birth which no other piece of good luck can afford she had more than her rightful share of practical good sense but still she was human and to be human is to have ones little modicum of romance secreted away in ones composition one never ceases to make a hero of ones self in private during life but only alters the style of his heroism from time to time as the drifting years belittle certain gods of his admiration and raise up others in their stead that seem greater the recent wearing days and nights of watching and the wasting grief that had possessed her combined with the profound depression that naturally came with the reaction of idleness made laura peculiarly susceptible at this time to romantic impressions she was a heroine now with a mysterious father somewhere she could not really tell whether she wanted to find him and spoil it all or not but still all the traditions of romance pointed to the making the attempt as the usual and necessary course to follow therefore she would some day begin the search when opportunity should offer now a former thought struck her she would speak to mrs hawkins and naturally enough mrs hawkins appeared on the stage at that moment she said she knew all she knew that laura had discovered the secret that mr hawkins the elder children col sellers and herself had kept so long and so faithfully and she cried and said that now that troubles had begun they would never end her daughters love would wean itself away from her and her heart would break her grief so wrought upon laura that the girl almost forgot her own troubles for the moment in her compassion for her mothers distress finally mrs hawkins said speak to me child do not forsake me forget all this miserable talk say i am your mother i have loved you so long and there is no other i am your mother in the sight of god and nothing shall ever take you from me all barriers fell before this appeal laura put her arms about her mothers neck and said you are my mother and always shall be we will be as we have always been and neither this foolish talk nor any other thing shall part us or make us less to each other than we are this hour there was no longer any sense of separation or estrangement between them indeed their love seemed more perfect now than it had ever been before by and by they went down stairs and sat by the fire and talked long and earnestly about lauras history and the letters but it transpired that mrs hawkins had never known of this correspondence between her husband and major lackland with his usual consideration for his wife mr hawkins had shielded her from the worry the matter would have caused her laura went to bed at last with a mind that had gained largely in tranquility and had lost correspondingly in morbid romantic exaltation she was pensive the next day and subdued but that was not matter for remark for she did not differ from the mournful friends about her in that respect clay and washington were the same loving and admiring brothers now that they had always been the great secret was new to some of the younger children but their love suffered no change under the wonderful revelation it is barely possible that things might have presently settled down into their old rut and the mystery have lost the bulk of its romantic sublimity in lauras eyes if the village gossips could have quieted down but they could not quiet down and they did not day after day they called at the house ostensibly upon visits of condolence and they pumped away at the mother and the children without seeming to know that their questionings were in bad taste they meant no harm they only wanted to know villagers always want to know the family fought shy of the questionings and of course that was high testimony if the duchess was respectably born why didnt they come out and prove it why did they stick to that poor thin story about picking her up out of a steamboat explosion under this ceaseless persecution lauras morbid selfcommuning was renewed at night the days contribution of detraction innuendo and malicious conjecture would be canvassed in her mind and then she would drift into a course of thinking as her thoughts ran on the indignant tears would spring to her eyes and she would spit out fierce little ejaculations at intervals but finally she would grow calmer and say some comforting disdainful thing something like this but who are they animals what are their opinions to me let them talk i will not stoop to be affected by it i could hate nonsense nobody i care for or in any way respect is changed toward me i fancy she may have supposed she was thinking of many individuals but it was not so she was thinking of only one and her heart warmed somewhat too the while one day a friend overheard a conversation like this and naturally came and told her all about it ned they say you dont go there any more how is that well i dont but i tell you its not because i dont want to and its not because i think it is any matter who her father was or who he wasnt either its only on account of this talk talk talk i think she is a fine girl every way and so would you if you knew her as well as i do but you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about its all up with her the world wont ever let her alone after that the only comment laura made upon this revelation was then it appears that if this trouble had not occurred i could have had the happiness of mr ned thurstons serious attentions he is well favored in person and well liked too i believe and comes of one of the first families of the village he is prosperous too i hear has been a doctor a year now and has had two patients no three i think yes it was three i attended their funerals well other people have hoped and been disappointed i am not alone in that i wish you could stay to dinner maria we are going to have sausages and besides i wanted to talk to you about hawkeye and make you promise to come and see us when we are settled there but maria could not stay she had come to mingle romantic tears with lauras over the lovers defection and had found herself dealing with a heart that could not rise to an appreciation of affliction because its interest was all centred in sausages but as soon as maria was gone laura stamped her expressive foot and said the coward are all books lies i thought he would fly to the front and be brave and noble and stand up for me against all the world and defy my enemies and wither these gossips with his scorn poor crawling thing let him go i do begin to despise thin world she lapsed into thought presently she said if the time ever comes and i get a chance oh ill she could not find a word that was strong enough perhaps by and by she said well i am glad of it im glad of it i never cared anything for him anyway and then with small consistency she cried a little and patted her foot more indignantly than ever chapter xi two months had gone by and the hawkins family were domiciled in hawkeye washington was at work in the real estate office again and was alternately in paradise or the other place just as it happened that louise was gracious to him or seemingly indifferent because indifference or preoccupation could mean nothing else than that she was thinking of some other young person col sellers had asked him several times to dine with him when he first returned to hawkeye but washington for no particular reason had not accepted no particular reason except one which he preferred to keep to himself viz that he could not bear to be away from louise it occurred to him now that the colonel had not invited him lately could he be offended he resolved to go that very day and give the colonel a pleasant surprise it was a good idea especially as louise had absented herself from breakfast that morning and torn his heart he would tear hers now and let her see how it felt the sellers family were just starting to dinner when washington burst upon them with his surprise for an instant the colonel looked nonplussed and just a bit uncomfortable and mrs sellers looked actually distressed but the next moment the head of the house was himself again and exclaimed all right my boy all right always glad to see you always glad to hear your voice and take you by the hand dont wait for special invitations thats all nonsense among friends just come whenever you can and come as often as you can the oftener the better you cant please us any better than that washington the little woman will tell you so herself we dont pretend to style plain folks you know plain folks just a plain family dinner but such as it is our friends are always welcome i reckon you know that yourself washington run along children run along lafayette in those old days the average man called his children after his most revered literary and historical idols consequently there was hardly a family at least in the west but had a washington in it and also a lafayette a franklin and six or eight sounding names from byron scott and the bible if the offspring held out to visit such a family was to find ones self confronted by a congress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the majestic dead of all the ages there was something thrilling about it to a stranger not to say awe inspiring stand off the cats tail child cant you see what youre doing come come come roderick dhu it isnt nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemens coat tails but never mind him washington hes full of spirits and dont mean any harm children will be children you know take the chair next to mrs sellers washington tut tut marie antoinette let your brother have the fork if he wants it you are bigger than he is washington contemplated the banquet and wondered if he were in his right mind was this the plain family dinner and was it all present it was soon apparent that this was indeed the dinner it was all on the table it consisted of abundance of clear fresh water and a basin of raw turnips nothing more washington stole a glance at mrs sellerss face and would have given the world the next moment if he could have spared her that the poor womans face was crimson and the tears stood in her eyes washington did not know what to do he wished he had never come there and spied out this cruel poverty and brought pain to that poor little ladys heart and shame to her cheek but he was there and there was no escape col sellers hitched back his coat sleeves airily from his wrists as who should say now for solid enjoyment seized a fork flourished it and began to harpoon turnips and deposit them in the plates before him let me help you washington lafayette pass this plate washington ah well well my boy things are looking pretty bright now i tell you speculation my the whole atmospheres full of money i wouldnt take three fortunes for one little operation ive got on hand now have anything from the casters no well youre right youre right some people like mustard with turnips but now there was baron poniatowski lord but that man did know how to live true russian you know russian to the back bone i say to my wife give me a russian every time for a table comrade the baron used to say take mustard sellers try the mustard a man cant know what turnips are in perfection without mustard but i always said no baron im a plain man and i want my food plain none of your embellishments for beriah sellers no made dishes for me and its the best way high living kills more than it cures in this world you can rest assured of that yes indeed washington ive got one little operation on hand that take some more water help yourself wont you help yourself theres plenty of it youll find it pretty good i guess how does that fruit strike you washington said he did not know that he had ever tasted better he did not add that he detested turnips even when they were cooked loathed them in their natural state no he kept this to himself and praised the turnips to the peril of his soul i thought youd like them examine them examine them theyll bear it see how perfectly firm and juicy they are they cant start any like them in this part of the country i can tell you these are from new jersey i imported them myself they cost like sin too but lord bless me i go in for having the best of a thing even if it does cost a little more its the best economy in the long run these are the early malcolm its a turnip that cant be produced except in just one orchard and the supply never is up to the demand take some more water washington you cant drink too much water with fruit all the doctors say that the plague cant come where this article is my boy plague what plague what plague indeed why the asiatic plague that nearly depopulated london a couple of centuries ago but how does that concern us there is no plague here i reckon sh ive let it out well never mind just keep it to yourself perhaps i oughtnt said anything but its bound to come out sooner or later so what is the odds old mcdowells wouldnt like me to to bother it all ill jest tell the whole thing and let it go you see ive been down to st louis and i happened to run across old dr mcdowells thinks the world of me does the doctor hes a man that keeps himself to himself and well he may for he knows that hes got a reputation that covers the whole earth he wont condescend to open himself out to many people but lord bless you he and i are just like brothers he wont let me go to a hotel when im in the city says im the only man thats company to him and i dont know but theres some truth in it too because although i never like to glorify myself and make a great todo over what i am or what i can do or what i know i dont mind saying here among friends that i am better read up in most sciences maybe than the general run of professional men in these days well the other day he let me into a little secret strictly on the quiet about this matter of the plague you see its booming right along in our direction follows the gulf stream you know just as all those epidemics do and within three months it will be just waltzing through this land like a whirlwind and whoever it touches can make his will and contract for the funeral well you cant cure it you know but you can prevent it how turnips thats it turnips and water nothing like it in the world old mcdowells says just fill yourself up two or three times a day and you can snap your fingers at the plague sh keep mum but just you confine yourself to that diet and youre all right i wouldnt have old mcdowells know that i told about it for anything he never would speak to me again take some more water washington the more water you drink the better here let me give you some more of the turnips no no no now i insist there now absorb those theyre mighty sustaining brim full of nutriment all the medical books say so just eat from four to seven goodsized turnips at a meal and drink from a pint and a half to a quart of water and then just sit around a couple of hours and let them ferment youll feel like a fighting cock next day fifteen or twenty minutes later the colonels tongue was still chattering away he had piled up several future fortunes out of several incipient operations which he had blundered into within the past week and was now soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of late promising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eyewater and at such a time washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic listener but he was not for two matters disturbed his mind and distracted his attention one was that he discovered to his confusion and shame that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the turnips he had robbed those hungry children he had not needed the dreadful fruit and had not wanted it and when he saw the pathetic sorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to give them he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing young things with all his heart the other matter that disturbed him was the dire inflation that had begun in his stomach it grew and grew it became more and more insupportable evidently the turnips were fermenting he forced himself to sit still as long as he could but his anguish conquered him at last he rose in the midst of the colonels talk and excused himself on the plea of a previous engagement the colonel followed him to the door promising over and over again that he would use his influence to get some of the early malcolms for him and insisting that he should not be such a stranger but come and take potluck with him every chance he got washington was glad enough to get away and feel free again he immediately bent his steps toward home in bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray and then a blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with gratitude weak and languid he made shift to turn himself about and seek rest and sleep and as his soul hovered upon the brink of unconciousness he heaved a long deep sigh and said to himself that in his heart he had cursed the colonels preventive of rheumatism before and now let the plague come if it must he was done with preventives if ever any man beguiled him with turnips and water again let him die the death if he dreamed at all that night no gossiping spirit disturbed his visions to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in the east more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few years would develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate and fortunes of the hawkins family chapter xii oh its easy enough to make a fortune henry said it seems to be easier than it is i begin to think replied philip well why dont you go into something youll never dig it out of the astor library if there be any place and time in the world where and when it seems easy to go into something it is in broadway on a spring morning when one is walking cityward and has before him the long lines of palaceshops with an occasional spire seen through the soft haze that lies over the lower town and hears the roar and hum of its multitudinous traffic to the young american here or elsewhere the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon he is embarrassed which to choose and is not unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances before giving himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object he has no traditions to bind him or guide him and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and make a new way for himself philip sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain he felt that he could be a rich man he wanted to be rich he had a sincere desire for a fortune but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it he never walked broadway a part of its tide of abundant shifting life without feeling something of the flush of wealth and unconsciously taking the elastic step of one welltodo in this prosperous world especially at night in the crowded theatre philip was too young to remember the old chambers street box where the serious burton led his hilarious and pagan crew in the intervals of the screaming comedy when the orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes the world seemed full of opportunities to philip and his heart exulted with a conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck perhaps it was the swimming ease of the acting on the stage where virtue had its reward in three easy acts perhaps it was the excessive light of the house or the music or the buzz of the excited talk between acts perhaps it was youth which believed everything but for some reason while philip was at the theatre he had the utmost confidence in life and his ready victory in it delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire of cheap sentiment and high and mighty dialogue will there not always be rosin enough for the squeaking fiddlebow do we not all like the maudlin hero who is sneaking round the right entrance in wait to steal the pretty wife of his rich and tyrannical neighbor from the pasteboard cottage at the left entrance and when he advances down to the footlights and defiantly informs the audience that he who lays his hand on a woman except in the way of kindness do we not all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named but he learned afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man without any exception whatsoever is always acquitted by the jury the fact was though philip sterling did not know it that he wanted several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth the modest fellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement it might be for a book or for the skillful management of some great newspaper or for some daring expedition like that of lt strain or dr kane he was unable to decide exactly what it should be sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region where the datepalm grows and the nightingales voice is in tune and the bulbul sings on the off nights if he were good enough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the theological seminary who were seeing new york life in preparation for the ministry philip was a new england boy and had graduated at yale he had not carried off with him all the learning of that venerable institution but he knew some things that were not in the regular course of study a very good use of the english language and considerable knowledge of its literature was one of them he could sing a song very well not in time to be sure but with enthusiasm he could make a magnetic speech at a moments notice in the class room the debating society or upon any fence or drygoods box that was convenient he could lift himself by one arm and do the giant swing in the gymnasium he could strike out from his left shoulder he could handle an oar like a professional and pull stroke in a winning race philip had a good appetite a sunny temper and a clear hearty laugh he had brown hair hazel eyes set wide apart a broad but not high forehead and a fresh winning face he was six feet high with broad shoulders long legs and a swinging gait one of those loosejointed capable fellows who saunter into the world with a free air and usually make a stir in whatever company they enter after he left college philip took the advice of friends and read law law seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the anteroom of the law office where he was writing philip invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees besides philip hated the copying of pleadings and he was certain that a life of whereases and aforesaids and whipping the devil round the stump would be intolerable note these few paragraphs are nearly an autobiography of the life of charles dudley warner whose contributions to the story start here with chapter xii dw his pen therefore and whereas and not as aforesaid strayed off into other scribbling in an unfortunate hour he had two or three papers accepted by firstclass magazines at three dollars the printed page and behold his vocation was open to him he would make his mark in literature life has no moment so sweet as that in which a young man believes himself called into the immortal ranks of the masters of literature it is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation at the time of this history philip had gone to new york for a career with his talent he thought he should have little difficulty in getting an editorial position upon a metropolitan newspaper not that he knew anything about news paper work or had the least idea of journalism he knew he was not fitted for the technicalities of the subordinate departments but he could write leaders with perfect ease he was sure the drudgery of the newspaper office was too distaste ful and besides it would be beneath the dignity of a graduate and a successful magazine writer he wanted to begin at the top of the ladder to his surprise he found that every situation in the editorial department of the journals was full always had been full was always likely to be full it seemed to him that the newspaper managers didnt want genius but mere plodding and grubbing philip therefore read diligently in the astor library planned literary works that should compel attention and nursed his genius he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the dorking convention then in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grapevine and see what he could get a line for it one day he had an offer from some country friends who believed in him to take charge of a provincial daily newspaper and he went to consult mr gringo gringo who years ago managed the atlas about taking the situation take it of course says gringo take anything that offers why not but they want me to make it an opposition paper well make it that that party is going to succeed its going to elect the next president i dont believe it said philip stoutly its wrong in principle and it ought not to succeed but i dont see how i can go for a thing i dont believe in o very well said gringo turning away with a shade of contempt youll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you cant afford a conscience like that but philip did afford it and he wrote thanking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world it was in this time of rather impatient waiting that philip was one morning walking down broadway with henry brierly he frequently accompanied henry part way down town to what the latter called his office in broad street to which he went or pretended to go with regularity every day it was evident to the most casual acquaintance that he was a man of affairs and that his time was engrossed in the largest sort of operations about which there was a mysterious air his liability to be suddenly summoned to washington or boston or montreal or even to liverpool was always imminent he never was so summoned but none of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone to panama or peoria or to hear from him that he had bought the bank of commerce the two were intimate at that time they had been class mates and saw a great deal of each other indeed they lived together in ninth street in a boardinghouse there which had the honor of lodging and partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney who have since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity it was during the morning walk to which reference has been made that henry brierly suddenly said philip how would you like to go to st jo i think i should like it of all things replied philip with some hesitation but what for oh its a big operation we are going a lot of us railroad men engineers contractors you know my uncle is a great railroad man ive no doubt i can get you a chance to go if youll go but in what capacity would i go well im going as an engineer you can go as one i dont know an engine from a coal cart field engineer civil engineer you can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures its easy enough ill show you about that well get trautwine and some of those books yes but what is it for what is it all about why dont you see we lay out a line spot the good land enter it up know where the stations are to be spot them buy lots theres heaps of money in it we wouldnt engineer long when do you go was philips next question after some moments of silence tomorrow is that too soon no its not too soon ive been ready to go anywhere for six months the fact is henry that im about tired of trying to force myself into things and am quite willing to try floating with the stream for a while and see where i will land this seems like a providential call its sudden enough the two young men who were by this time full of the adventure went down to the wall street office of henrys uncle and had a talk with that wily operator the uncle knew philip very well and was pleased with his frank enthusiasm and willing enough to give him a trial in the western venture it was settled therefore in the prompt way in which things are settled in new york that they would start with the rest of the company next morning for the west on the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering and suits of indiarubber which they supposed they would need in a new and probably damp country and many other things which nobody ever needed anywhere the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends if they disapprove thought he ive done my duty by letting them know happy youth that is ready to pack its valise and start for cathay on an hours notice by the way calls out philip from his bedroom to henry where is st jo why its in missouri somewhere on the frontier i think well get a map never mind the map we will find the place itself i was afraid it was nearer home philip wrote a long letter first of all to his mother full of love and glowing anticipations of his new opening he wouldnt bother her with business details but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would see him return with a moderate fortune and something to add to the comfort of her advancing years to his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some new york capitalists to go to missouri in a land and railroad operation which would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer him a business opening he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter it was to ruth bolton that philip wrote last he might never see her again he went to seek his fortune he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever but there was no real danger to a person who took care of himself might he write to her often and tell her of his life if he returned with a fortune perhaps and perhaps if he was unsuccessful or if he never returned perhaps it would be as well no time or distance however would ever lessen his interest in her he would say goodnight but not goodbye in the soft beginning of a spring morning long before new york had breakfasted while yet the air of expectation hung about the wharves of the metropolis our young adventurers made their way to the jersey city railway station of the erie road to begin the long swinging crooked journey over what a writer of a former day called a causeway of cracked rails and cows to the west chapter xiii what ever to say be toke in his entente his langage was so fayer pertynante yt semeth unto manys herying not only the worde but veryly the thyng caxtons book of curtesye in the party of which our travelers found themselves members was duff brown the great railroad contractor and subsequently a wellknown member of congress a bluff jovial bostn man thickset close shaven with a heavy jaw and a low forehead a very pleasant man if you were not in his way he had government contracts also custom houses and dry docks from portland to new orleans and managed to get out of congress in appropriations about weight for weight of gold for the stone furnished associated with him and also of this party was rodney schaick a sleek new york broker a man as prominent in the church as in the stock exchange dainty in his dress smooth of speech the necessary complement of duff brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and adroitness it would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party one that shook off more readily the artificial restraints of puritanic strictness and took the world with goodnatured allowance money was plenty for every attainable luxury and there seemed to be no doubt that its supply would continue and that fortunes were about to be made without a great deal of toil even philip soon caught the prevailing spirit barry did not need any inoculation he always talked in six figures it was as natural for the dear boy to be rich as it is for most people to be poor the elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact which almost all travelers to the west soon find out that the water was poor it must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had brandy flasks with which to qualify the water of the country and it was no doubt from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that they kept experimenting mixing a little of the dangerous and changing fluid as they passed along with the contents of the flasks thus saving their lives hour by hour philip learned afterwards that temperance and the strict observance of sunday and a certain gravity of deportment are geographical habits which people do not usually carry with them away from home our travelers stopped in chicago long enough to see that they could make their fortunes there in two weeks tine but it did not seem worth while the west was more attractive the further one went the wider the opportunities opened they took railroad to alton and the steamboat from there to st louis for the change and to have a glimpse of the river isnt this jolly cried henry dancing out of the barbers room and coming down the deck with a one two three step shaven curled and perfumed after his usual exquisite fashion whats jolly asked philip looking out upon the dreary and monotonous waste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its way why the whole thing its immense i can tell you i wouldnt give that to be guaranteed a hundred thousand cold cash in a years time wheres mr brown he is in the saloon playing poker with schaick and that long haired party with the striped trousers who scrambled aboard when the stage plank was half hauled in and the big delegate to congress from out west thats a fine looking fellow that delegate with his glossy black whiskers looks like a washington man i shouldnt think hed be at poker oh its only five cent ante just to make it interesting the delegate said but i shouldnt think a representative in congress would play poker any way in a public steamboat nonsense youve got to pass the time i tried a hand myself but those old fellows are too many for me the delegate knows all the points id bet a hundred dollars he will ante his way right into the united states senate when his territory comes in hes got the cheek for it he has the grave and thoughtful manner of expectoration of a public man for one thing added philip harry said philip after a pause what have you got on those big boots for do you expect to wade ashore im breaking em in the fact was harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper costume for a new country and was in appearance a sort of compromise between a dandy of broadway and a backwoodsman harry with blue eyes fresh complexion silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair was as handsome as a fashion plate he wore this morning a soft hat a short cutaway coat an open vest displaying immaculate linen a leathern belt round his waist and topboots of soft leather well polished that came above his knees and required a string attached to his belt to keep them up the light hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his well shaped legs and told philip that they were a perfect protection against prairie rattlesnakes which never strike above the knee the landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our travelers left chicago it was a genial spring day when they landed at st louis the birds were singing the blossoms of peach trees in city garden plots made the air sweet and in the roar and tumult on the long river levee they found an excitement that accorded with their own hopeful anticipations the party went to the southern hotel where the great duff brown was very well known and indeed was a man of so much importance that even the office clerk was respectful to him he might have respected in him also a certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money which the clerk greatly admired the young fellows liked the house and liked the city it seemed to them a mighty free and hospitable town coming from the east they were struck with many peculiarities everybody smoked in the streets for one thing they noticed everybody took a drink in an open manner whenever he wished to do so or was asked as if the habit needed no concealment or apology in the evening when they walked about they found people sitting on the doorsteps of their dwellings in a manner not usual in a northern city in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks were filled with chairs and benches paris fashion said harry upon which people lounged in these warm spring evenings smoking always smoking and the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air it was delightful harry at once found on landing that his backwoods custom would not be needed in st louis and that in fact he had need of all the resources of his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the town but this did not much matter for harry was always superior to his clothes as they were likely to be detained some time in the city harry told philip that he was going to improve his time and he did it was an encouragement to any industrious man to see this young fellow rise carefully dress himself eat his breakfast deliberately smoke his cigar tranquilly and then repair to his room to what he called his work with a grave and occupied manner but with perfect cheerfulness harry would take off his coat remove his cravat roll up his shirtsleeves give his curly hair the right touch before the glass get out his book on engineering his boxes of instruments his drawing paper his profile paper open the book of logarithms mix his india ink sharpen his pencils light a cigar and sit down at the table to lay out a line with the most grave notion that he was mastering the details of engineering he would spend half a day in these preparations without ever working out a problem or having the faintest conception of the use of lines or logarithms and when he had finished he had the most cheerful confidence that he had done a good days work it made no difference however whether harry was in his room in a hotel or in a tent philip soon found he was just the same in camp he would get himself up in the most elaborate toilet at his command polish his long boots to the top lay out his work before him and spend an hour or longer if anybody was looking at him humming airs knitting his brows and working at engineering and if a crowd of gaping rustics were looking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to him you see he says to philip one morning at the hotel when he was thus engaged i want to get the theory of this thing so that i can have a check on the engineers i thought you were going to be an engineer yourself queried philip not many times if the court knows herself theres better game brown and schaick have or will have the control for the whole line of the salt lick pacific extension forty thousand dollars a mile over the prairie with extra for hardpan and itll be pretty much all hardpan i can tell you besides every alternate section of land on this line theres millions in the job im to have the subcontract for the first fifty miles and you can bet its a soft thing ill tell you what you do philip continued larry in a burst of generosity if i dont get you into my contract youll be with the engineers and you jest stick a stake at the first ground marked for a depot buy the land of the farmer before he knows where the depot will be and well turn a hundred or so on that ill advance the money for the payments and you can sell the lots schaick is going to let me have ten thousand just for a flyer in such operations but thats a good deal of money wait till you are used to handling money i didnt come out here for a bagatelle my uncle wanted me to stay east and go in on the mobile custom house work up the washington end of it he said there was a fortune in it for a smart young fellow but i preferred to take the chances out here did i tell you i had an offer from bobbett and fanshaw to go into their office as confidential clerk on a salary of ten thousand why didnt you take it asked philip to whom a salary of two thousand would have seemed wealth before he started on this journey take it id rather operate on my own hook said harry in his most airy manner a few evenings after their arrival at the southern philip and harry made the acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman whom they had frequently seen before about the hotel corridors and passed a casual word with he had the air of a man of business and was evidently a person of importance the precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more substantial form of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman himself and occurred in this wise meeting the two friends in the lobby one evening he asked them to give him the time and added excuse me gentlemen strangers in st louis ah yesyes from the east perhaps ah just so just so eastern born myself virginia sellers is my name beriah sellers ah by the way new york did you say that reminds me just met some gentlemen from your state a week or two ago very prominent gentlemen in public life they are you must know them without doubt let me see let me see curious those names have escaped me i know they were from your state because i remember afterward my old friend governor shackleby said to me fine man is the governor one of the finest men our country has produced said he colonel how did you like those new york gentlemen not many such men in the world colonel sellers said the governor yes it was new york he said i remember it distinctly i cant recall those names somehow but no matter stopping here gentlemen stopping at the southern in shaping their reply in their minds the title mr had a place in it but when their turn had arrived to speak the title colonel came from their lips instead they said yes they were abiding at the southern and thought it a very good house yes yes the southern is fair i myself go to the planters old aristocratic house we southern gentlemen dont change our ways you know i always make it my home there when i run down from hawkeye my plantation is in hawkeye a little up in the country you should know the planters philip and harry both said they should like to see a hotel that had been so famous in its day a cheerful hostelrie philip said it must have been where duels were fought there across the diningroom table you may believe it sir an uncommonly pleasant lodging shall we walk and the three strolled along the streets the colonel talking all the way in the most liberal and friendly manner and with a frank openheartedness that inspired confidence yes born east myself raised all along know the west a great country gentlemen the place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a fortune simply pick it up its lying round loose here not a day that i dont put aside an opportunity too busy to look into it management of my own property takes my time first visit looking for an opening yes looking around replied harry ah here we are youd rather sit here in front than go to my apartments so had i an opening eh the colonels eyes twinkled ah just so the country is opening up all we want is capital to develop it slap down the rails and bring the land into market the richest land on god almightys footstool is lying right out there if i had my capital free i could plant it for millions i suppose your capital is largely in your plantation asked philip well partly sir partly im down here now with reference to a little operation a little side thing merely by the way gentlemen excuse the liberty but its about my usual time the colonel paused but as no movement of his acquaintances followed this plain remark he added in an explanatory manner im rather particular about the exact time have to be in this climate even this open declaration of his hospitable intention not being understood the colonel politely said gentlemen will you take something col sellers led the way to a saloon on fourth street under the hotel and the young gentlemen fell into the custom of the country not that said the colonel to the barkeeper who shoved along the counter a bottle of apparently cornwhiskey as if he had done it before on the same order not that with a wave of the hand that otard if you please yes never take an inferior liquor gentlemen not in the evening in this climate there thats the stuff my respects the hospitable gentleman having disposed of his liquor remarking that it was not quite the thing when a man has his own cellar to go to he is apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors called for cigars but the brand offered did not suit him he motioned the box away and asked for some particular havanas those in separate wrappers i always smoke this sort gentlemen they are a little more expensive but youll learn in this climate that youd better not economize on poor cigars having imparted this valuable piece of information the colonel lighted the fragrant cigar with satisfaction and then carelessly put his fingers into his right vest pocket that movement being without result with a shade of disappointment on his face he felt in his left vest pocket not finding anything there he looked up with a serious and annoyed air anxiously slapped his right pantaloons pocket and then his left and exclaimed by george thats annoying by george thats mortifying never had anything of that kind happen to me before ive left my pocketbook hold heres a bill after all no thunder its a receipt allow me said philip seeing how seriously the colonel was annoyed and taking out his purse the colonel protested he couldnt think of it and muttered something to the barkeeper about hanging it up but the vender of exhilaration made no sign and philip had the privilege of paying the costly shot col sellers profusely apologizing and claiming the right next time next time as soon as beriah sellers had bade his friends good night and seen them depart he did not retire apartments in the planters but took his way to his lodgings with a friend in a distant part of the city chapter xiv the letter that philip sterling wrote to ruth bolton on the evening of setting out to seek his fortune in the west found that young lady in her own fathers house in philadelphia it was one of the pleasantest of the many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city which is territorially one of the largest cities in the world and only prevented from becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive strip of camden and amboy sand which shuts it off from the atlantic ocean it is a city of steady thrift the arms of which might well be the deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to its feasts it was a spring morning and perhaps it was the influence of it that made ruth a little restless satisfied neither with the outdoors nor the indoors her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors independence hall girard college and fairmount water works and park four objects which americans cannot die peacefully even in naples without having seen but ruth confessed that she was tired of them and also of the mint she was tired of other things she tried this morning an air or two upon the piano sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open window read philips letter was she thinking about philip as she gazed across the fresh lawn over the tree tops to the chelton hills or of that world which his entrance into her traditionbound life had been one of the means of opening to her whatever she thought she was not idly musing as one might see by the expression of her face after a time she took up a book it was a medical work and to all appearance about as interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large but her face was soon aglow over its pages and she was so absorbed in it that she did not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door ruth well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience i wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans mother thee knows i couldnt stand it at westfield the school stifled me its a place to turn young people into dried fruit i know said margaret bolton with a half anxious smile thee chafes against all the ways of friends but what will thee do why is thee so discontented if i must say it mother i want to go away and get out of this dead level with a look half of pain and half of pity her mother answered i am sure thee is little interfered with thee dresses as thee will and goes where thee pleases to any church thee likes and thee has music i had a visit yesterday from the societys committee by way of discipline because we have a piano in the house which is against the rules i hope thee told the elders that father and i are responsible for the piano and that much as thee loves music thee is never in the room when it is played fortunately father is already out of meeting so they cant discipline him i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations i desire thy happiness first of all but thee is starting out on a dangerous path is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the worlds people i have not asked him ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers and when thee has got the education thee wants and lost all relish for the society of thy friends and the ways of thy ancestors what then ruth turned square round to her mother and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone said mother im going to study medicine margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity thee study medicine a slight frail girl like thee study medicine does thee think thee could stand it six months and the lectures and the dissecting rooms has thee thought of the dissecting rooms mother said ruth calmly i have thought it all over i know i can go through the whole clinics dissecting room and all does thee think i lack nerve what is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person living but thy health and strength child thee can never stand the severe application and besides suppose thee does learn medicine i will practice it here here where thee and thy family are known if i can get patients i hope at least ruth thee will let us know when thee opens an office said her mother with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in as she rose and left the room ruth sat quite still for a tine with face intent and flushed it was out now she had begun her open battle the sightseers returned in high spirits from the city was there any building in greece to compare with girard college was there ever such a magnificent pile of stone devised for the shelter of poor orphans think of the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body if they were orphans would they like to be brought up in a grecian temple and then there was broad street wasnt it the broadest and the longest street in the world there certainly was no end to it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest but neither st girard nor broad street neither wonders of the mint nor the glories of the hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing the declaration impressed the visitors so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargains on eighth street the truth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the yearly meeting and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event was scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly circles is thee going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls i have nothing to wear replied that demure person if thee wants to see new bonnets orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the true form thee must go to the arch street meeting any departure from either color or shape would be instantly taken note of it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet oh thee must go by all means but thee wont see there a sweeter woman than mother and thee wont go why should i ive been again and again if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in germantown where the windows are all open and i can see the trees and hear the stir of the leaves its such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then theres the row of sleeklooking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out no i dont feel at home there that evening ruth and her father sat late by the drawingroom fire as they were quite apt to do at night it was always a time of confidences thee has another letter from young sterling said eli bolton yes philip has gone to the far west how far he doesnt say but its on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a wednesday meeting humph it was time for him to do something is he going to start a daily newspaper among the kickapoos father thees unjust to philip hes going into business what sort of business can a young man go into without capital he doesnt say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but its something about land and railroads and thee knows father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country i should think so you innocent puss and in an old one too but philip is honest and he has talent enough if he will stop scribbling to make his way but thee may as well take care of theeself ruth and not go dawdling along with a young man in his adventures until thy own mind is a little more settled what thee wants this excellent advice did not seem to impress ruth greatly for she was looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her grey eyes and at length she exclaimed with a sort of impatience i wish i could go west or south or somewhere what a box women are put into measured for it and put in young if we go anywhere its in a box veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities father i should like to break things and get loose what a sweetvoiced little innocent it was to be sure thee will no doubt break things enough when thy time comes child women always have but what does thee want now that thee hasnt i want to be something to make myself something to do something why should i rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because i am a girl what would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die what one useful thing could i do for a living for the support of mother and the children and if i had a fortune would thee want me to lead a useless life has thy mother led a useless life somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything retorted the sharp little disputant whats the good father of a series of human beings who dont advance any friend eli who had long ago laid aside the quaker dress and was out of meeting and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his belief nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle of his hatched in a friends dovecote but he only said has thee consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a career thee wants ruth did not reply directly she complained that her mother didnt understand her but that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself she also had a history possibly and had sometime beaten her young wings against the cage of custom and indulged in dreams of a new social order and had passed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind which has not yet tried its limits to break up and rearrange the world ruth replied to philips letter in due time and in the most cordial and unsentimental manner philip liked the letter as he did everything she did but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the letter than about him he took it with him from the southern hotel when he went to walk and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as he stumbled along the rather commonplace and unformed handwriting seemed to him peculiar and characteristic different from that of any other woman ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him she should pray for his success at any rate and especially that the indians in st louis would not take his scalp philip looked rather dubious at this sentence and wished that he had written nothing about indians chapter xv eli bolton and his wife talked over ruths case as they had often done before with no little anxiety alone of all their children she was impatient of the restraints and monotony of the friends society and wholly indisposed to accept the inner light as a guide into a life of acceptance and inaction when margaret told her husband of ruths newest project he did not exhibit so much surprise as she hoped for in fact he said that he did not see why a woman should not enter the medical profession if she felt a call to it but said margaret consider her total inexperience of the world and her frail health can such a slight little body endure the ordeal of the preparation for or the strain of the practice of the profession did thee ever think margaret whether she can endure being thwarted in an object on which she has so set her heart as she has on this thee has trained her thyself at home in her enfeebled childhood and thee knows how strong her will is and what she has been able to accomplish in selfculture by the simple force of her determination she never will be satisfied until she has tried her own strength i wish said margaret with an inconsequence that is not exclusively feminine that she were in the way to fall in love and marry by and by i think that would cure her of some of her notions i am not sure but if she went away to some distant school into an entirely new life her thoughts would be diverted eli bolton almost laughed as he regarded his wife with eyes that never looked at her except fondly and replied perhaps thee remembers that thee had notions also before we were married and before thee became a member of meeting i think ruth comes honestly by certain tendencies which thee has hidden under the friends dress margaret could not say no to this and while she paused it was evident that memory was busy with suggestions to shake her present opinions why not let ruth try the study for a time suggested eli there is a fair beginning of a womans medical college in the city quite likely she will soon find that she needs first a more general culture and fall in with thy wish that she should see more of the world at some large school there really seemed to be nothing else to be done and margaret consented at length without approving and it was agreed that ruth in order to spare her fatigue should take lodgings with friends near the college and make a trial in the pursuit of that science to which we all owe our lives and sometimes as by a miracle of escape that day mr bolton brought home a stranger to dinner mr bigler of the great firm of pennybacker bigler small railroad contractors he was always bringing home somebody who had a scheme to build a road or open a mine or plant a swamp with cane to grow paperstock or found a hospital or invest in a patent shadbone separator or start a college somewhere on the frontier contiguous to a land speculation the bolton house was a sort of hotel for this kind of people they were always coming ruth had known them from childhood and she used to say that her father attracted them as naturally as a sugar hogshead does flies ruth had an idea that a large portion of the world lived by getting the rest of the world into schemes mr bolton never could say no to any of them not even said ruth again to the society for stamping oyster shells with scripture texts before they were sold at retail mr biglers plan this time about which he talked loudly with his mouth full all dinner time was the building of the tunkhannock rattlesnake and youngwomanstown railroad which would not only be a great highway to the west but would open to market inexhaustible coalfields and untold millions of lumber the plan of operations was very simple well buy the lands explained he on long time backed by the notes of good men and then mortgage them for money enough to get the road well on then get the towns on the line to issue their bonds for stock and sell their bonds for enough to complete the road and partly stock it especially if we mortgage each section as we complete it we can then sell the rest of the stock on the prospect of the business of the road through an improved country and also sell the lands at a big advance on the strength of the road all we want continued mr bigler in his frank manner is a few thousand dollars to start the surveys and arrange things in the legislature there is some parties will have to be seen who might make us trouble it will take a good deal of money to start the enterprise remarked mr bolton who knew very well what seeing a pennsylvania legislature meant but was too polite to tell mr bigler what he thought of him while he was his guest what security would one have for it mr bigler smiled a hard kind of smile and said youd be inside mr bolton and youd have the first chance in the deal this was rather unintelligible to ruth who was nevertheless somewhat amused by the study of a type of character she had seen before at length she interrupted the conversation by asking youd sell the stock i suppose mr bigler to anybody who was attracted by the prospectus o certainly serve all alike said mr bigler now noticing ruth for the first time and a little puzzled by the serene intelligent face that was turned towards him well what would become of the poor people who had been led to put their little money into the speculation when you got out of it and left it half way it would be no more true to say of mr bigler that he was or could be embarrassed than to say that a brass counterfeit dollarpiece would change color when refused the question annoyed him a little in mr boltons presence why yes miss of course in a great enterprise for the benefit of the community there will little things occur which which and of course the poor ought to be looked to i tell my wife that the poor must be looked to if you can tell who are poor theres so many impostors and then theres so many poor in the legislature to be looked after said the contractor with a sort of a chuckle isnt that so mr bolton eli bolton replied that he never had much to do with the legislature yes continued this public benefactor an uncommon poor lot this year uncommon consequently an expensive lot the fact is mr bolton that the price is raised so high on united states senator now that it affects the whole market you cant get any public improvement through on reasonable terms simony is what i call it simony repeated mr bigler as if he had said a good thing mr bigler went on and gave some very interesting details of the intimate connection between railroads and politics and thoroughly entertained himself all dinner time and as much disgusted ruth who asked no more questions and her father who replied in monosyllables i wish said ruth to her father after the guest had gone that you wouldnt bring home any more such horrid men do all men who wear big diamond breastpins flourish their knives at table and use bad grammar and cheat o child thee mustnt be too observing mr bigler is one of the most important men in the state nobody has more influence at harrisburg i dont like him any more than thee does but id better lend him a little money than to have his ill will father i think theed better have his illwill than his company is it true that he gave money to help build the pretty little church of st james the less and that he is one of the vestrymen yes he is not such a bad fellow one of the men in third street asked him the other day whether his was a high church or a low church bigler said he didnt know hed been in it once and he could touch the ceiling in the side aisle with his hand i think hes just horrid was ruths final summary of him after the manner of the swift judgment of women with no consideration of the extenuating circumstances mr bigler had no idea that he had not made a good impression on the whole family he certainly intended to be agreeable margaret agreed with her daughter and though she never said anything to such people she was grateful to ruth for sticking at least one pin into him such was the serenity of the bolton household that a stranger in it would never have suspected there was any opposition to ruths going to the medical school and she went quietly to take her residence in town and began her attendance of the lectures as if it were the most natural thing in the world she did not heed if she heard the busy and wondering gossip of relations and acquaintances gossip that has no less currency among the friends than elsewhere because it is whispered slyly and creeps about in an undertone ruth was absorbed and for the first time in her life thoroughly happy happy in the freedom of her life and in the keen enjoyment of the investigation that broadened its field day by day she was in high spirits when she came home to spend first days the house was full of her gaiety and her merry laugh and the children wished that ruth would never go away again but her mother noticed with a little anxiety the sometimes flushed face and the sign of an eager spirit in the kindling eyes and as well the serious air of determination and endurance in her face at unguarded moments the college was a small one and it sustained itself not without difficulty in this city which is so conservative and is yet the origin of so many radical movements there were not more than a dozen attendants on the lectures all together so that the enterprise had the air of an experiment and the fascination of pioneering for those engaged in it there was one woman physician driving about town in her carriage attacking the most violent diseases in all quarters with persistent courage like a modern bellona in her war chariot who was popularly supposed to gather in fees to the amount ten to twenty thousand dollars a year perhaps some of these students looked forward to the near day when they would support such a practice and a husband besides but it is unknown that any of them ever went further than practice in hospitals and in their own nurseries and it is feared that some of them were quite as ready as their sisters in emergencies to call a man if ruth had any exaggerated expectations of a professional life she kept them to herself and was known to her fellows of the class simply as a cheerful sincere student eager in her investigations and never impatient at anything except an insinuation that women had not as much mental capacity for science as men they really say said one young quaker sprig to another youth of his age that ruth bolton is really going to be a sawbones attends lectures cuts up bodies and all that shes cool enough for a surgeon anyway he spoke feelingly for he had very likely been weighed in ruths calm eyes sometime and thoroughly scared by the little laugh that accompanied a puzzling reply to one of his conversational nothings such young gentlemen at this time did not come very distinctly into ruths horizon except as amusing circumstances about the details of her student life ruth said very little to her friends but they had reason to know afterwards that it required all her nerve and the almost complete exhaustion of her physical strength to carry her through she began her anatomical practice upon detached portions of the human frame which were brought into the demonstrating room dissecting the eye the ear and a small tangle of muscles and nerves an occupation which had not much more savor of death in it than the analysis of a portion of a plant out of which the life went when it was plucked up by the roots custom inures the most sensitive persons to that which is at first most repellant and in the late war we saw the most delicate women who could not at home endure the sight of blood become so used to scenes of carnage that they walked the hospitals and the margins of battlefields amid the poor remnants of torn humanity with as perfect selfpossession as if they were strolling in a flower garden it happened that ruth was one evening deep in a line of investigation which she could not finish or understand without demonstration and so eager was she in it that it seemed as if she could not wait till the next day she therefore persuaded a fellow student who was reading that evening with her to go down to the dissecting room of the college and ascertain what they wanted to know by an hours work there perhaps also ruth wanted to test her own nerve and to see whether the power of association was stronger in her mind than her own will the janitor of the shabby and comfortless old building admitted the girls not without suspicion and gave them lighted candles which they would need without other remark than theres a new one miss as the girls went up the broad stairs they climbed to the third story and paused before a door which they unlocked and which admitted them into a long apartment with a row of windows on one side and one at the end the room was without light save from the stars and the candles the girls carried which revealed to them dimly two long and several small tables a few benches and chairs a couple of skeletons hanging on the wall a sink and clothcovered heaps of something upon the tables here and there the windows were open and the cool night wind came in strong enough to flutter a white covering now and then and to shake the loose casements but all the sweet odors of the night could not take from the room a faint suggestion of mortality the young ladies paused a moment the room itself was familiar enough but night makes almost any chamber eerie and especially such a room of detention as this where the mortal parts of the unburied might almost be supposed to be visited on the sighing night winds by the wandering spirits of their late tenants opposite and at some distance across the roofs of lower buildings the girls saw a tall edifice the long upper story of which seemed to be a dancing hall the windows of that were also open and through them they heard the scream of the jiggered and tortured violin and the pump pump of the oboe and saw the moving shapes of men and women in quick transition and heard the prompters drawl i wonder said ruth what the girls dancing there would think if they saw us or knew that there was such a room as this so near them she did not speak very loud and perhaps unconsciously the girls drew near to each other as they approached the long table in the centre of the room a straight object lay upon it covered with a sheet this was doubtless the new one of which the janitor spoke ruth advanced and with a not very steady hand lifted the white covering from the upper part of the figure and turned it down both the girls started it was a negro the black face seemed to defy the pallor of death and asserted an ugly lifelikeness that was frightful ruth was as pale as the white sheet and her comrade whispered come away ruth it is awful perhaps it was the wavering light of the candles perhaps it was only the agony from a death of pain but the repulsive black face seemed to wear a scowl that said havent you yet done with the outcast persecuted black man but you must now haul him from his grave and send even your women to dismember his body who is this dead man one of thousands who died yesterday and will be dust anon to protest that science shall not turn his worthless carcass to some account ruth could have had no such thought for with a pity in her sweet face that for the moment overcame fear and disgust she reverently replaced the covering and went away to her own table as her companion did to hers and there for an hour they worked at their several problems without speaking but not without an awe of the presence there the new one and not without an awful sense of life itself as they heard the pulsations of the music and the light laughter from the dancinghall when at length they went away and locked the dreadful room behind them and came out into the street where people were passing they for the first time realized in the relief they felt what a nervous strain they had been under chapter xvi while ruth was thus absorbed in her new occupation and the spring was wearing away philip and his friends were still detained at the southern hotel the great contractors had concluded their business with the state and railroad officials and with the lesser contractors and departed for the east but the serious illness of one of the engineers kept philip and henry in the city and occupied in alternate watchings philip wrote to ruth of the new acquaintance they had made col sellers an enthusiastic and hospitable gentleman very much interested in the development of the country and in their success they had not had an opportunity to visit at his place up in the country yet but the colonel often dined with them and in confidence confided to them his projects and seemed to take a great liking to them especially to his friend harry it was true that he never seemed to have ready money but he was engaged in very large operations the correspondence was not very brisk between these two young persons so differently occupied for though philip wrote long letters he got brief ones in reply full of sharp little observations however such as one concerning col sellers namely that such men dined at their house every week ruths proposed occupation astonished philip immensely but while he argued it and discussed it he did not dare hint to her his fear that it would interfere with his most cherished plans he too sincerely respected ruths judgment to make any protest however and he would have defended her course against the world this enforced waiting at st louis was very irksome to philip his money was running away for one thing and he longed to get into the field and see for himself what chance there was for a fortune or even an occupation the contractors had given the young men leave to join the engineer corps as soon as they could but otherwise had made no provision for them and in fact had left them with only the most indefinite expectations of something large in the future harry was entirely happy in his circumstances he very soon knew everybody from the governor of the state down to the waiters at the hotel he had the wall street slang at his tongues end he always talked like a capitalist and entered with enthusiasm into all the land and railway schemes with which the air was thick col sellers and harry talked together by the hour and by the day harry informed his new friend that he was going out with the engineer corps of the salt lick pacific extension but that wasnt his real business im to have with another party said harry a big contract in the road as soon as it is let and meantime im with the engineers to spy out the best land and the depot sites its everything suggested the colonel in knowing where to invest ive known people throwaway their money because they were too consequential to take sellers advice others again have made their pile on taking it ive looked over the ground ive been studying it for twenty years you cant put your finger on a spot in the map of missouri that i dont know as if id made it when you want to place anything continued the colonel confidently just let beriah sellers know thats all oh i havent got much in ready money i can lay my hands on now but if a fellow could do anything with fifteen or twenty thousand dollars as a beginning i shall draw for that when i see the right opening well thats something thats something fifteen or twenty thousand dollars say twenty as an advance said the colonel reflectively as if turning over his mind for a project that could be entered on with such a trifling sum ill tell you what it is but only to you mr brierly only to you mind ive got a little project that ive been keeping it looks small looks small on paper but its got a big future what should you say sir to a city built up like the rod of aladdin had touched it built up in two years where now you wouldnt expect it any more than youd expect a lighthouse on the top of pilot knob and you could own the land it can be done sir it can be done the colonel hitched up his chair close to harry laid his hand on his knee and first looking about him said in a low voice the salt lick pacific extension is going to run through stones landing the almighty never laid out a cleaner piece of level prairie for a city and its the natural center of all that region of hemp and tobacco what makes you think the road will go there its twenty miles on the map off the straight line of the road you cant tell what is the straight line till the engineers have been over it between us i have talked with jeff thompson the division engineer he understands the wants of stones landing and the claims of the inhabitants who are to be there jeff says that a railroad is for the accommodation of the people and not for the benefit of gophers and if he dont run this to stones landing hell be damned you ought to know jeff hes one of the most enthusiastic engineers in this western country and one of the best fellows that ever looked through the bottom of a glass the recommendation was not undeserved there was nothing that jeff wouldnt do to accommodate a friend from sharing his last dollar with him to winging him in a duel when he understood from col sellers how the land lay at stones landing he cordially shook hands with that gentleman asked him to drink and fairly roared out why god bless my soul colonel a word from one virginia gentleman to another is nuff ced theres stones landing been waiting for a railroad more than four thousand years and damme if she shant have it philip had not so much faith as harry in stones landing when the latter opened the project to him but harry talked about it as if he already owned that incipient city harry thoroughly believed in all his projects and inventions and lived day by day in their golden atmosphere everybody liked the young fellow for how could they help liking one of such engaging manners and large fortune the waiters at the hotel would do more for him than for any other guest and he made a great many acquaintances among the people of st louis who liked his sensible and liberal views about the development of the western country and about st louis he said it ought to be the national capital harry made partial arrangements with several of the merchants for furnishing supplies for his contract on the salt lick pacific extension consulted the maps with the engineers and went over the profiles with the contractors figuring out estimates for bids he was exceedingly busy with those things when he was not at the bedside of his sick acquaintance or arranging the details of his speculation with col sellers meantime the days went along and the weeks and the money in harrys pocket got lower and lower he was just as liberal with what he had as before indeed it was his nature to be free with his money or with that of others and he could lend or spend a dollar with an air that made it seem like ten at length at the end of one week when his hotel bill was presented harry found not a cent in his pocket to meet it he carelessly remarked to the landlord that he was not that day in funds but he would draw on new york and he sat down and wrote to the contractors in that city a glowing letter about the prospects of the road and asked them to advance a hundred or two until he got at work no reply came he wrote again in an unoffended business like tone suggesting that he had better draw at three days a short answer came to this simply saying that money was very tight in wall street just then and that he had better join the engineer corps as soon as he could but the bill had to be paid and harry took it to philip and asked him if he thought he hadnt better draw on his uncle philip had not much faith in harrys power of drawing and told him that he would pay the bill himself whereupon harry dismissed the matter then and thereafter from his thoughts and like a lighthearted good fellow as he was gave himself no more trouble about his boardbills philip paid them swollen as they were with a monstrous list of extras but he seriously counted the diminishing bulk of his own hoard which was all the money he had in the world had he not tacitly agreed to share with harry to the last in this adventure and would not the generous fellow divide with him if he philip were in want and harry had anything the fever at length got tired of tormenting the stout young engineer who lay sick at the hotel and left him very thin a little sallow but an acclimated man everybody said he was acclimated now and said it cheerfully what it is to be acclimated to western fevers no two persons exactly agree some say it is a sort of vaccination that renders death by some malignant type of fever less probable some regard it as a sort of initiation like that into the odd fellows which renders one liable to his regular dues thereafter others consider it merely the acquisition of a habit of taking every morning before breakfast a dose of bitters composed of whiskey and assafoetida out of the acclimation jug jeff thompson afterwards told philip that he once asked senator atchison then acting vicepresident of the united states about the possibility of acclimation he thought the opinion of the second officer of our great government would be valuable on this point they were sitting together on a bench before a country tavern in the free converse permitted by our democratic habits i suppose senator that you have become acclimated to this country well said the vicepresident crossing his legs pulling his wideawake down over his forehead causing a passing chicken to hop quickly one side by the accuracy of his aim and speaking with senatorial deliberation i think i have ive been here twentyfive years and dash dash my dash to dash if i havent entertained twentyfive separate and distinct earthquakes one a year the niggro is the only person who can stand the fever and ague of this region the convalescence of the engineer was the signal for breaking up quarters at st louis and the young fortunehunters started up the river in good spirits it was only the second time either of them had been upon a mississippi steamboat and nearly everything they saw had the charm of novelty col sellers was at the landing to bid thorn goodbye i shall send you up that basket of champagne by the next boat no no no thanks youll find it not bad in camp he cried out as the plank was hauled in my respects to thompson tell him to sight for stones let me know mr brierly when you are ready to locate ill come over from hawkeye goodbye and the last the young fellows saw of the colonel he was waving his hat and beaming prosperity and good luck the voyage was delightful and was not long enough to become monotonous the travelers scarcely had time indeed to get accustomed to the splendors of the great saloon where the tables were spread for meals a marvel of paint and gilding its ceiling hung with fancifully cut tissuepaper of many colors festooned and arranged in endless patterns the whole was more beautiful than a barbers shop the printed bill of fare at dinner was longer and more varied the proprietors justly boasted than that of any hotel in new york it must have been the work of an author of talent and imagination and it surely was not his fault if the dinner itself was to a certain extent a delusion and if the guests got something that tasted pretty much the same whatever dish they ordered nor was it his fault if a general flavor of rose in all the dessert dishes suggested that they hid passed through the barbers saloon on their way from the kitchen the travelers landed at a little settlement on the left bank and at once took horses for the camp in the interior carrying their clothes and blankets strapped behind the saddles harry was dressed as we have seen him once before and his long and shining boots attracted not a little the attention of the few persons they met on the road and especially of the bright faced wenches who lightly stepped along the highway picturesque in their colored kerchiefs carrying light baskets or riding upon mules and balancing before them a heavier load harry sang fragments of operas and talked abort their fortune philip even was excited by the sense of freedom and adventure and the beauty of the landscape the prairie with its new grass and unending acres of brilliant flowers chiefly the innumerable varieties of phloxbore the look of years of cultivation and the occasional open groves of white oaks gave it a parklike appearance it was hardly unreasonable to expect to see at any moment the gables and square windows of an elizabethan mansion in one of the well kept groves towards sunset of the third day when the young gentlemen thought they ought to be near the town of magnolia near which they had been directed to find the engineers camp they descried a log house and drew up before it to enquire the way half the building was store and half was dwelling house at the door of the latter stood a regress with a bright turban on her head to whom philip called can you tell me auntie how far it is to the town of magnolia why bress you chile laughed the woman yous dere now it was true this log horse was the compactly built town and all creation was its suburbs the engineers camp was only two or three miles distant yous boun to find it directed auntie if you dont keah nuffin bout de road and go fo de sundown a brisk gallop brought the riders in sight of the twinkling light of the camp just as the stars came out it lay in a little hollow where a small stream ran through a sparse grove of young white oaks a half dozen tents were pitched under the trees horses and oxen were corraled at a little distance and a group of men sat on camp stools or lay on blankets about a bright fire the twang of a banjo became audible as they drew nearer and they saw a couple of negroes from some neighboring plantation breaking down a juba in approved style amid the hi his of the spectators mr jeff thompson for it was the camp of this redoubtable engineer gave the travelers a hearty welcome offered them ground room in his own tent ordered supper and set out a small jug a drop from which he declared necessary on account of the chill of the evening i never saw an eastern man said jeff who knew how to drink from a jug with one hand its as easy as lying so he grasped the handle with the right hand threw the jug back upon his arm and applied his lips to the nozzle it was an act as graceful as it was simple besides said mr thompson setting it down it puts every man on his honor as to quantity early to turn in was the rule of the camp and by nine oclock everybody was under his blanket except jeff himself who worked awhile at his table over his fieldbook and then arose stepped outside the tent door and sang in a strong and not unmelodious tenor the star spangled banner from beginning to end it proved to be his nightly practice to let off the unexpended seam of his conversational powers in the words of this stirring song it was a long time before philip got to sleep he saw the fire light he saw the clear stars through the treetops he heard the gurgle of the stream the stamp of the horses the occasional barking of the dog which followed the cooks wagon the hooting of an owl and when these failed he saw jeff standing on a battlement mid the rockets red glare and heard him sing oh say can you see it was the first time he had ever slept on the ground chapter xvii we have viewd it and measurd it within all by the scale the richest tract of land love in the kingdom there will be made seventeen or eighteeen millions or more ast may be handled the devil is an ass nobody dressed more like an engineer than mr henry brierly the completeness of his appointments was the envy of the corps and the gay fellow himself was the admiration of the camp servants axemen teamsters and cooks i reckon you didnt git them boots no whers this side o sent louis queried the tall missouri youth who acted as commissariys assistant no new york yas ive heern o new york continued the butternut lad attentively studying each item of harrys dress and endeavoring to cover his design with interesting conversation n theres massachusetts its not far off ive heern massachusetts was a of a place les see what states massachusetts in massachusetts kindly replied harry is in the state of boston abolishn want it they must a cost right smart referring to the boots harry shouldered his rod and went to the field tramped over the prairie by day and figured up results at night with the utmost cheerfulness and industry and plotted the line on the profile paper without however the least idea of engineering practical or theoretical perhaps there was not a great deal of scientific knowledge in the entire corps nor was very much needed they were making what is called a preliminary survey and the chief object of a preliminary survey was to get up an excitement about the road to interest every town in that part of the state in it under the belief that the road would run through it and to get the aid of every planter upon the prospect that a station would be on his land mr jeff thompson was the most popular engineer who could be found for this work he did not bother himself much about details or practicabilities of location but ran merrily along sighting from the top of one divide to the top of another and striking plumb every town site and big plantation within twenty or thirty miles of his route in his own language he just went booming this course gave harry an opportunity as he said to learn the practical details of engineering and it gave philip a chance to see the country and to judge for himself what prospect of a fortune it offered both he and harry got the refusal of more than one plantation as they went along and wrote urgent letters to their eastern correspondents upon the beauty of the land and the certainty that it would quadruple in value as soon as the road was finally located it seemed strange to them that capitalists did not flock out there and secure this land they had not been in the field over two weeks when harry wrote to his friend col sellers that hed better be on the move for the line was certain to go to stones landing any one who looked at the line on the map as it was laid down from day to day would have been uncertain which way it was going but jeff had declared that in his judgment the only practicable route from the point they then stood on was to follow the divide to stones landing and it was generally understood that that town would be the next one hit well make it boys said the chief if we have to go in a balloon and make it they did in less than a week this indomitable engineer had carried his moving caravan over slues and branches across bottoms and along divides and pitched his tents in the very heart of the city of stones landing well ill be dashed was heard the cheery voice of mr thompson as he stepped outside the tent door at sunrise next morning if this dont get me i say yon grayson get out your sighting iron and see if you can find old sellers town blame me if we wouldnt have run plumb by it if twilight had held on a little longer oh sterling brierly get up and see the city theres a steamboat just coming round the bend and jeff roared with laughter the mayorll be round here to breakfast the fellows turned out of the tents rubbing their eyes and stared about them they were camped on the second bench of the narrow bottom of a crooked sluggish stream that was some five rods wide in the present good stage of water before them were a dozen log cabins with stick and mud chimneys irregularly disposed on either side of a not very well defined road which did not seem to know its own mind exactly and after straggling through the town wandered off over the rolling prairie in an uncertain way as if it had started for nowhere and was quite likely to reach its destination just as it left the town however it was cheered and assisted by a guideboard upon which was the legend mils to hawkeye the road had never been made except by the travel over it and at this season the rainy june it was a way of ruts cut in the black soil and of fathomless mudholes in the principal street of the city it had received more attention for hogs great and small rooted about in it and wallowed in it turning the street into a liquid quagmire which could only be crossed on pieces of plank thrown here and there about the chief cabin which was the store and grocery of this mart of trade the mud was more liquid than elsewhere and the rude platform in front of it and the drygoods boxes mounted thereon were places of refuge for all the loafers of the place down by the stream was a dilapidated building which served for a hemp warehouse and a shaky wharf extended out from it into the water in fact a flatboat was there moored by it its setting poles lying across the gunwales above the town the stream was crossed by a crazy wooden bridge the supports of which leaned all ways in the soggy soil the absence of a plank here and there in the flooring made the crossing of the bridge faster than a walk an offense not necessary to be prohibited by law this gentlemen said jeff is columbus river alias goose run if it was widened and deepened and straightened and made long enough it would be one of the finest rivers in the western country as the sun rose and sent his level beams along the stream the thin stratum of mist or malaria rose also and dispersed but the light was not able to enliven the dull water nor give any hint of its apparently fathomless depth venerable mudturtles crawled up and roosted upon the old logs in the stream their backs glistening in the sun the first inhabitants of the metropolis to begin the active business of the day it was not long however before smoke began to issue from the city chimneys and before the engineers had finished their breakfast they were the object of the curious inspection of six or eight boys and men who lounged into the camp and gazed about them with languid interest their hands in their pockets every one good morning gentlemen called out the chief engineer from the table good mawning drawled out the spokesman of the party i allow thishyers the railroad i heern it was acomin yes this is the railroad all but the rails and the ironhorse i reckon you kin git all the rails you want oaten my white oak timber over thar replied the first speaker who appeared to be a man of property and willing to strike up a trade youll have to negotiate with the contractors about the rails sir said jeff heres mr brierly ive no doubt would like to buy your rails when the time comes o said the man i thought maybe youd fetch the whole bilin along with you but if you want rails ive got em haint i eph heaps said eph without taking his eyes off the group at the table well said mr thompson rising from his seat and moving towards his tent the railroad has come to stones landing sure i move we take a drink on it all round the proposal met with universal favor jeff gave prosperity to stones landing and navigation to goose run and the toast was washed down with gusto in the simple fluid of corn and with the return compliment that a rail road was a good thing and that jeff thompson was no slouch about ten oclock a horse and wagon was descried making a slow approach to the camp over the prairie as it drew near the wagon was seen to contain a portly gentleman who hitched impatiently forward on his seat shook the reins and gently touched up his horse in the vain attempt to communicate his own energy to that dull beast and looked eagerly at the tents when the conveyance at length drew up to mr thompsons door the gentleman descended with great deliberation straightened himself up rubbed his hands and beaming satisfaction from every part of his radiant frame advanced to the group that was gathered to welcome him and which had saluted him by name as soon as he came within hearing welcome to napoleon gentlemen welcome i am proud to see you here mr thompson you are looking well mr sterling this is the country sir right glad to see you mr brierly you got that basket of champagne no those blasted river thieves ill never send anything more by em the best brand roederer the last i had in my cellar from a lot sent me by sir george gore took him out on a buffalo hunt when he visited our country is always sending me some trifle you havent looked about any yet gentlemen its in the rough yet in the rough those buildings will all have to come down thats the place for the public square court house hotels churches jail all that sort of thing about where we stand the deepo how does that strike your engineering eye mr thompson down yonder the business streets running to the wharves the university up there on rising ground sightly place see the river for miles thats columbus river only fortynine miles to the missouri you see what it is placid steady no current to interfere with navigation wants widening in places and dredging dredge out the harbor and raise a levee in front of the town made by nature on purpose for a mart look at all this country not another building within ten miles no other navigable stream lay of the land points right here hemp tobacco corn must come here the railroad will do it napoleon wont know itself in a year dont now evidently said philip aside to harry have you breakfasted colonel hastily cup of coffee cant trust any coffee i dont import myself but i put up a basket of provisions wife would put in a few delicacies women always will and a half dozen of that burgundy i was telling you of mr briefly by the way you never got to dine with me and the colonel strode away to the wagon and looked under the seat for the basket apparently it was not there for the colonel raised up the flap looked in front and behind and then exclaimed confound it that comes of not doing a thing yourself i trusted to the women folks to set that basket in the wagon and it aint there the camp cook speedily prepared a savory breakfast for the colonel broiled chicken eggs cornbread and coffee to which he did ample justice and topped off with a drop of old bourbon from mr thompsons private store a brand which he said he knew well he should think it came from his own sideboard while the engineer corps went to the field to run back a couple of miles and ascertain approximately if a road could ever get down to the landing and to sight ahead across the run and see if it could ever get out again col sellers and harry sat down and began to roughly map out the city of napoleon on a large piece of drawing paper ive got the refusal of a mile square here said the colonel in our names for a year with a quarter interest reserved for the four owners they laid out the town liberally not lacking room leaving space for the railroad to come in and for the river as it was to be when improved the engineers reported that the railroad could come in by taking a little sweep and crossing the stream on a high bridge but the grades would be steep col sellers said he didnt care so much about the grades if the road could only be made to reach the elevators on the river the next day mr thompson made a hasty survey of the stream for a mile or two so that the colonel and harry were enabled to show on their map how nobly that would accommodate the city jeff took a little writing from the colonel and harry for a prospective share but philip declined to join in saying that he had no money and didnt want to make engagements he couldnt fulfill the next morning the camp moved on followed till it was out of sight by the listless eyes of the group in front of the store one of whom remarked that hed be doggoned if he ever expected to see that railroad any mo harry went with the colonel to hawkeye to complete their arrangements a part of which was the preparation of a petition to congress for the improvement of the navigation of columbus river chapter xviii eight years have passed since the death of mr hawkins eight years are not many in the life of a nation or the history of a state but they maybe years of destiny that shall fix the current of the century following such years were those that followed the little scrimmage on lexington common such years were those that followed the doubleshotted demand for the surrender of fort sumter history is never done with inquiring of these years and summoning witnesses about them and trying to understand their significance the eight years in america from to uprooted institutions that were centuries old changed the politics of a people transformed the social life of half the country and wrought so profoundly upon the entire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of two or three generations as we are accustomed to interpret the economy of providence the life of the individual is as nothing to that of the nation or the race but who can say in the broader view and the more intelligent weight of values that the life of one man is not more than that of a nationality and that there is not a tribunal where the tragedy of one human soul shall not seem more significant than the overturning of any human institution whatever when one thinks of the tremendous forces of the upper and the nether world which play for the mastery of the soul of a woman during the few years in which she passes from plastic girlhood to the ripe maturity of womanhood he may well stand in awe before the momentous drama what capacities she has of purity tenderness goodness what capacities of vileness bitterness and evil nature must needs be lavish with the mother and creator of men and centre in her all the possibilities of life and a few critical years can decide whether her life is to be full of sweetness and light whether she is to be the vestal of a holy temple or whether she will be the fallen priestess of a desecrated shrine there are women it is true who seem to be capable neither of rising much nor of falling much and whom a conventional life saves from any special development of character but laura was not one of them she had the fatal gift of beauty and that more fatal gift which does not always accompany mere beauty the power of fascination a power that may indeed exist without beauty she had will and pride and courage and ambition and she was left to be very much her own guide at the age when romance comes to the aid of passion and when the awakening powers of her vigorous mind had little object on which to discipline themselves the tremendous conflict that was fought in this girls soul none of those about her knew and very few knew that her life had in it anything unusual or romantic or strange those were troublous days in hawkeye as well as in most other missouri towns days of confusion when between unionist and confederate occupations sudden maraudings and bushwhackings and raids individuals escaped observation or comment in actions that would have filled the town with scandal in quiet times fortunately we only need to deal with lauras life at this period historically and look back upon such portions of it as will serve to reveal the woman as she was at the time of the arrival of mr harry brierly in hawkeye the hawkins family were settled there and had a hard enough struggle with poverty and the necessity of keeping up appearances in accord with their own family pride and the large expectations they secretly cherished of a fortune in the knobs of east tennessee how pinched they were perhaps no one knew but clay to whom they looked for almost their whole support washington had been in hawkeye off and on attracted away occasionally by some tremendous speculation from which he invariably returned to gen boswells office as poor as he went he was the inventor of no one knew how many useless contrivances which were not worth patenting and his years had been passed in dreaming and planning to no purpose until he was now a man of about thirty without a profession or a permanent occupation a tall brownhaired dreamy person of the best intentions and the frailest resolution probably however the eight years had been happier to him than to any others in his circle for the time had been mostly spent in a blissful dream of the coming of enormous wealth he went out with a company from hawkeye to the war and was not wanting in courage but he would have been a better soldier if he had been less engaged in contrivances for circumventing the enemy by strategy unknown to the books it happened to him to be captured in one of his selfappointed expeditions but the federal colonel released him after a short examination satisfied that he could most injure the confederate forces opposed to the unionists by returning him to his regiment col sellers was of course a prominent man during the war he was captain of the home guards in hawkeye and he never left home except upon one occasion when on the strength of a rumor he executed a flank movement and fortified stones landing a place which no one unacquainted with the country would be likely to find gad said the colonel afterwards the landing is the key to upper missouri and it is the only place the enemy never captured if other places had been defended as well as that was the result would have been different sir the colonel had his own theories about war as he had in other things if everybody had stayed at home as he did he said the south never would have been conquered for what would there have been to conquer mr jeff davis was constantly writing him to take command of a corps in the confederate army but col sellers said no his duty was at home and he was by no means idle he was the inventor of the famous air torpedo which came very near destroying the union armies in missouri and the city of st louis itself his plan was to fill a torpedo with greek fire and poisonous and deadly missiles attach it to a balloon and then let it sail away over the hostile camp and explode at the right moment when the timefuse burned out he intended to use this invention in the capture of st louis exploding his torpedoes over the city and raining destruction upon it until the army of occupation would gladly capitulate he was unable to procure the greek fire but he constructed a vicious torpedo which would have answered the purpose but the first one prematurely exploded in his woodhouse blowing it clean away and setting fire to his house the neighbors helped him put out the conflagration but they discouraged any more experiments of that sort the patriotic old gentleman however planted so much powder and so many explosive contrivances in the roads leading into hawkeye and then forgot the exact spots of danger that people were afraid to travel the highways and used to come to town across the fields the colonels motto was millions for defence but not one cent for tribute when laura came to hawkeye she might have forgotten the annoyances of the gossips of murpheysburg and have out lived the bitterness that was growing in her heart if she had been thrown less upon herself or if the surroundings of her life had been more congenial and helpful but she had little society less and less as she grew older that was congenial to her and her mind preyed upon itself and the mystery of her birth at once chagrined her and raised in her the most extravagant expectations she was proud and she felt the sting of poverty she could not but be conscious of her beauty also and she was vain of that and came to take a sort of delight in the exercise of her fascinations upon the rather loutish young men who came in her way and whom she despised there was another world opened to her a world of books but it was not the best world of that sort for the small libraries she had access to in hawkeye were decidedly miscellaneous and largely made up of romances and fictions which fed her imagination with the most exaggerated notions of life and showed her men and women in a very false sort of heroism from these stories she learned what a woman of keen intellect and some culture joined to beauty and fascination of manner might expect to accomplish in society as she read of it and along with these ideas she imbibed other very crude ones in regard to the emancipation of woman there were also other bookshistories biographies of distinguished people travels in far lands poems especially those of byron scott and shelley and moore which she eagerly absorbed and appropriated therefrom what was to her liking nobody in hawkeye had read so much or after a fashion studied so diligently as laura she passed for an accomplished girl and no doubt thought herself one as she was judged by any standard near her during the war there came to hawkeye a confederate officer col selby who was stationed there for a time in command of that district he was a handsome soldierly man of thirty years a graduate of the university of virginia and of distinguished family if his story might be believed and it was evident a man of the world and of extensive travel and adventure to find in such an out of the way country place a woman like laura was a piece of good luck upon which col selby congratulated himself he was studiously polite to her and treated her with a consideration to which she was unaccustomed she had read of such men but she had never seen one before one so highbred so noble in sentiment so entertaining in conversation so engaging in manner it is a long story unfortunately it is an old story and it need not be dwelt on laura loved him and believed that his love for her was as pure and deep as her own she worshipped him and would have counted her life a little thing to give him if he would only love her and let her feed the hunger of her heart upon him the passion possessed her whole being and lifted her up till she seemed to walk on air it was all true then the romances she had read the bliss of love she had dreamed of why had she never noticed before how blithesome the world was how jocund with love the birds sang it the trees whispered it to her as she passed the very flowers beneath her feet strewed the way as for a bridal march when the colonel went away they were engaged to be married as soon as he could make certain arrangements which he represented to be necessary and quit the army he wrote to her from harding a small town in the southwest corner of the state saying that he should be held in the service longer than he had expected but that it would not be more than a few months then he should be at liberty to take her to chicago where he had property and should have business either now or as soon as the war was over which he thought could not last long meantime why should they be separated he was established in comfortable quarters and if she could find company and join him they would be married and gain so many more months of happiness was woman ever prudent when she loved laura went to harding the neighbors supposed to nurse washington who had fallen ill there her engagement was of course known in hawkeye and was indeed a matter of pride to her family mrs hawkins would have told the first inquirer that laura had gone to be married but laura had cautioned her she did not want to be thought of she said as going in search of a husband let the news come back after she was married so she traveled to harding on the pretence we have mentioned and was married she was married but something must have happened on that very day or the next that alarmed her washington did not know then or after what it was but laura bound him not to send news of her marriage to hawkeye yet and to enjoin her mother not to speak of it whatever cruel suspicion or nameless dread this was laura tried bravely to put it away and not let it cloud her happiness communication that summer as may be imagined was neither regular nor frequent between the remote confederate camp at harding and hawkeye and laura was in a measure lost sight of indeed everyone had troubles enough of his own without borrowing from his neighbors laura had given herself utterly to her husband and if he had faults if he was selfish if he was sometimes coarse if he was dissipated she did not or would not see it it was the passion of her life the time when her whole nature went to flood tide and swept away all barriers was her husband ever cold or indifferent she shut her eyes to everything but her sense of possession of her idol three months passed one morning her husband informed her that he had been ordered south and must go within two hours i can be ready said laura cheerfully but i cant take you you must go back to hawkeye canttakeme laura asked with wonder in her eyes i cant live without you you said o bother what i said and the colonel took up his sword to buckle it on and then continued coolly the fact is laura our romance is played out laura heard but she did not comprehend she caught his arm and cried george how can you joke so cruelly i will go any where with you i will wait any where i cant go back to hawkeye well go where you like perhaps continued he with a sneer you would do as well to wait here for another colonel lauras brain whirled she did not yet comprehend what does this mean where are you going it means said the officer in measured words that you havent anything to show for a legal marriage and that i am going to new orleans its a lie george its a lie i am your wife i shall go i shall follow you to new orleans perhaps my wife might not like it laura raised her head her eyes flamed with fire she tried to utter a cry and fell senseless on the floor when she came to herself the colonel was gone washington hawkins stood at her bedside did she come to herself was there anything left in her heart but hate and bitterness a sense of an infamous wrong at the hands of the only man she had ever loved she returned to hawkeye with the exception of washington and his mother no one knew what had happened the neighbors supposed that the engagement with col selby had fallen through laura was ill for a long time but she recovered she had that resolution in her that could conquer death almost and with her health came back her beauty and an added fascination a something that might be mistaken for sadness is there a beauty in the knowledge of evil a beauty that shines out in the face of a person whose inward life is transformed by some terrible experience is the pathos in the eyes of the beatrice cenci from her guilt or her innocence laura was not much changed the lovely woman had a devil in her heart that was all chapter xix mr harry brierly drew his pay as an engineer while he was living at the city hotel in hawkeye mr thompson had been kind enough to say that it didnt make any difference whether he was with the corps or not and although harry protested to the colonel daily and to washington hawkins that he must go back at once to the line and superintend the layout with reference to his contract yet he did not go but wrote instead long letters to philip instructing him to keep his eye out and to let him know when any difficulty occurred that required his presence meantime harry blossomed out in the society of hawkeye as he did in any society where fortune cast him and he had the slightest opportunity to expand indeed the talents of a rich and accomplished young fellow like harry were not likely to go unappreciated in such a place a land operator engaged in vast speculations a favorite in the select circles of new york in correspondence with brokers and bankers intimate with public men at washington one who could play the guitar and touch the banjo lightly and who had an eye for a pretty girl and knew the language of flattery was welcome everywhere in hawkeye even miss laura hawkins thought it worth while to use her fascinations upon him and to endeavor to entangle the volatile fellow in the meshes of her attractions gad says harry to the colonel shes a superb creature shed make a stir in new york money or no money there are men i know would give her a railroad or an opera house or whatever she wanted at least theyd promise harry had a way of looking at women as he looked at anything else in the world he wanted and he half resolved to appropriate miss laura during his stay in hawkeye perhaps the colonel divined his thoughts or was offended at harrys talk for he replied no nonsense mr brierly nonsense wont do in hawkeye not with my friends the hawkins blood is good blood all the way from tennessee the hawkinses are under the weather now but their tennessee property is millions when it comes into market of course colonel not the least offense intended but you can see she is a fascinating woman i was only thinking as to this appropriation now what such a woman could do in washington all correct too all correct common thing i assure you in washington the wives of senators representatives cabinet officers all sorts of wives and some who are not wives use their influence you want an appointment do you go to senator x not much you get on the right side of his wife is it an appropriation youd go straight to the committee or to the interior office i suppose youd learn better than that it takes a woman to get any thing through the land office i tell you miss laura would fascinate an appropriation right through the senate and the house of representatives in one session if she was in washington as your friend colonel of course as your friend would you have her sign our petition asked the colonel innocently harry laughed women dont get anything by petitioning congress nobody does thats for form petitions are referred somewhere and thats the last of them you cant refer a handsome woman so easily when she is present they prefer em mostly the petition however was elaborately drawn up with a glowing description of napoleon and the adjacent country and a statement of the absolute necessity to the prosperity of that region and of one of the stations on the great through route to the pacific of the immediate improvement of columbus river to this was appended a map of the city and a survey of the river it was signed by all the people at stones landing who could write their names by col beriah sellers and the colonel agreed to have the names headed by all the senators and representatives from the state and by a sprinkling of exgovernors and exmembers of congress when completed it was a formidable document its preparation and that of more minute plots of the new city consumed the valuable time of sellers and harry for many weeks and served to keep them both in the highest spirits in the eyes of washington hawkins harry was a superior being a man who was able to bring things to pass in a way that excited his enthusiasm he never tired of listening to his stories of what he had done and of what he was going to do as for washington harry thought he was a man of ability and comprehension but too visionary he told the colonel the colonel said he might be right but he had never noticed anything visionary about him hes got his plans sir god bless my soul at his age i was full of plans but experience sobers a man i never touch any thing now that hasnt been weighed in my judgment and when beriah sellers puts his judgment on a thing there it is whatever might have been harrys intentions with regard to laura he saw more and more of her every day until he got to be restless and nervous when he was not with her that consummate artist in passion allowed him to believe that the fascination was mainly on his side and so worked upon his vanity while inflaming his ardor that he scarcely knew what he was about her coolness and coyness were even made to appear the simple precautions of a modest timidity and attracted him even more than the little tendernesses into which she was occasionally surprised he could never be away from her long day or evening and in a short time their intimacy was the town talk she played with him so adroitly that harry thought she was absorbed in love for him and yet he was amazed that he did not get on faster in his conquest and when he thought of it he was piqued as well a country girl poor enough that was evident living with her family in a cheap and most unattractive frame house such as carpenters build in america scantily furnished and unadorned without the adventitious aids of dress or jewels or the fine manners of society harry couldnt understand it but she fascinated him and held him just beyond the line of absolute familiarity at the same time while he was with her she made him forget that the hawkins house was nothing but a wooden tenement with four small square rooms on the ground floor and a half story it might have been a palace for aught he knew perhaps laura was older than harry she was at any rate at that ripe age when beauty in woman seems more solid than in the budding period of girlhood and she had come to understand her powers perfectly and to know exactly how much of the susceptibility and archness of the girl it was profitable to retain she saw that many women with the best intentions make a mistake of carrying too much girlishness into womanhood such a woman would have attracted harry at any time but only a woman with a cool brain and exquisite art could have made him lose his head in this way for harry thought himself a man of the world the young fellow never dreamed that he was merely being experimented on he was to her a man of another society and another culture different from that she had any knowledge of except in books and she was not unwilling to try on him the fascinations of her mind and person for laura had her dreams she detested the narrow limits in which her lot was cast she hated poverty much of her reading had been of modern works of fiction written by her own sex which had revealed to her something of her own powers and given her indeed an exaggerated notion of the influence the wealth the position a woman may attain who has beauty and talent and ambition and a little culture and is not too scrupulous in the use of them she wanted to be rich she wanted luxury she wanted men at her feet her slaves and she had not thanks to some of the novels she had read the nicest discrimination between notoriety and reputation perhaps she did not know how fatal notoriety usually is to the bloom of womanhood with the other hawkins children laura had been brought up in the belief that they had inherited a fortune in the tennessee lands she did not by any means share all the delusion of the family but her brain was not seldom busy with schemes about it washington seemed to her only to dream of it and to be willing to wait for its riches to fall upon him in a golden shower but she was impatient and wished she were a man to take hold of the business you men must enjoy your schemes and your activity and liberty to go about the world she said to harry one day when he had been talking of new york and washington and his incessant engagements oh yes replied that martyr to business its all well enough if you dont have too much of it but it only has one object what is that if a woman doesnt know its useless to tell her what do you suppose i am staying in hawkeye for week after week when i ought to be with my corps i suppose its your business with col sellers about napoleon youve always told me so answered laura with a look intended to contradict her words and now i tell you that is all arranged i suppose youll tell me i ought to go harry exclaimed laura touching his arm and letting her pretty hand rest there a moment why should i want you to go away the only person in hawkeye who understands me but you refuse to understand me replied harry flattered but still petulant you are like an iceberg when we are alone laura looked up with wonder in her great eyes and something like a blush suffusing her face followed by a look of langour that penetrated harrys heart as if it had been longing did i ever show any want of confidence in you harry and she gave him her hand which harry pressed with effusion something in her manner told him that he must be content with that favor it was always so she excited his hopes and denied him inflamed his passion and restrained it and wound him in her toils day by day to what purpose it was keen delight to laura to prove that she had power over men laura liked to hear about life at the east and especially about the luxurious society in which mr brierly moved when he was at home it pleased her imagination to fancy herself a queen in it you should be a winter in washington harry said but i have no acquaintances there dont know any of the families of the congressmen they like to have a pretty woman staying with them not one suppose col sellers should have business there say about this columbus river appropriation sellers and laura laughed you neednt laugh queerer things have happened sellers knows everybody from missouri and from the west too for that matter hed introduce you to washington life quick enough it doesnt need a crowbar to break your way into society there as it does in philadelphia its democratic washington is money or beauty will open any door if i were a handsome woman i shouldnt want any better place than the capital to pick up a prince or a fortune thank you replied laura but i prefer the quiet of home and the love of those i know and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and unworldliness that finished mr harry brierly for the day nevertheless the hint that harry had dropped fell upon good ground and bore fruit an hundred fold it worked in her mind until she had built up a plan on it and almost a career for herself why not she said why shouldnt i do as other women have done she took the first opportunity to see col sellers and to sound him about the washington visit how was he getting on with his navigation scheme would it be likely to take him from home to jefferson city or to washington perhaps well maybe if the people of napoleon want me to go to washington and look after that matter i might tear myself from my home its been suggested to me but not a word of it to mrs sellers and the children maybe they wouldnt like to think of their father in washington but dilworthy senator dilworthy says to me colonel you are the man you could influence more votes than any one else on such a measure an old settler a man of the people you know the wants of missouri youve a respect for religion too says he and know how the cause of the gospel goes with improvements which is true enough miss laura and hasnt been enough thought of in connection with napoleon hes an able man dilworthy and a good man a man has got to be good to succeed as he has hes only been in congress a few years and he must be worth a million first thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked about family prayers whether we had em before or after breakfast i hated to disappoint the senator but i had to out with it tell him we didnt have em not steady he said he understood business interruptions and all that some men were well enough without but as for him he never neglected the ordinances of religion he doubted if the columbus river appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the divine blessing on it perhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that senator dilworthy had not stayed with col sellers while he was in hawkeye this visit to his house being only one of the colonels hallucinations one of those instant creations of his fertile fancy which were always flashing into his brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and without interrupting the flow of it during the summer philip rode across the country and made a short visit in hawkeye giving harry an opportunity to show him the progress that he and the colonel had made in their operation at stones landing to introduce him also to laura and to borrow a little money when he departed harry bragged about his conquest as was his habit and took philip round to see his western prize laura received mr philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that rather surprised and not a little interested him he saw at once that she was older than harry and soon made up his mind that she was leading his friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed at least he thought he saw that and half hinted as much to harry who flared up at once but on a second visit philip was not so sure the young lady was certainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with harry and treated philip with the greatest consideration she deferred to his opinions and listened attentively when he talked and in time met his frank manner with an equal frankness so that he was quite convinced that whatever she might feel towards harry she was sincere with him perhaps his manly way did win her liking perhaps in her mind she compared him with harry and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her whole soul recklessly and with little care if she lost it philip was not invincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her presence the week seemed very short that he passed in hawkeye and when he bade laura good by he seemed to have known her a year we shall see you again mr sterling she said as she gave him her hand with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes and when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have disturbed his serenity if he had not at the moment had a little square letter in his breast pocket dated at philadelphia and signed ruth chapter xx the visit of senator abner dilworthy was an event in hawkeye when a senator whose place is in washington moving among the great and guiding the destinies of the nation condescends to mingle among the people and accept the hospitalities of such a place as hawkeye the honor is not considered a light one all parties are flattered by it and politics are forgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows senator dilworthy who was from a neighboring state had been a unionist in the darkest days of his country and had thriven by it but was that any reason why col sellers who had been a confederate and had not thriven by it should give him the cold shoulder the senator was the guest of his old friend gen boswell but it almost appeared that he was indebted to col sellers for the unreserved hospitalities of the town it was the large hearted colonel who in a manner gave him the freedom of the city you are known here sir said the colonel and hawkeye is proud of you you will find every door open and a welcome at every hearthstone i should insist upon your going to my house if you were not claimed by your older friend gen boswell but you will mingle with our people and you will see here developments that will surprise you the colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the impression upon himself that he had entertained the senator at his own mansion during his stay at any rate he afterwards always spoke of him as his guest and not seldom referred to the senators relish of certain viands on his table he did in fact press him to dine upon the morning of the day the senator was going away senator dilworthy was large and portly though not tall a pleasant spoken man a popular man with the people he took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country and made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture of education and of religion and especially as to the condition of the emancipated race providence he said has placed them in our hands and although you and i general might have chosen a different destiny for them under the constitution yet providence knows best you cant do much with em interrupted col sellers they are a speculating race sir disinclined to work for white folks without security planning how to live by only working for themselves idle sir theres my garden just a ruin of weeds nothing practical in em there is some truth in your observation colonel but you must educate them you educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was before if he wont stick to any industry except for himself now what will he do then but colonel the negro when educated will be more able to make his speculations fruitful never sir never he would only have a wider scope to injure himself a niggro has no grasp sir now a white man can conceive great operations and carry them out a niggro cant still replied the senator granting that he might injure himself in a worldly point of view his elevation through education would multiply his chances for the hereafter which is the important thing after all colonel and no matter what the result is we must fulfill our duty by this being id elevate his soul promptly responded the colonel thats just it you cant make his soul too immortal but i wouldnt touch him himself yes sir make his soul immortal but dont disturb the niggro as he is of course one of the entertainments offered the senator was a public reception held in the court house at which he made a speech to his fellow citizens col sellers was master of ceremonies he escorted the band from the city hotel to gen boswells he marshalled the procession of masons of odd fellows and of firemen the good templars the sons of temperance the cadets of temperance the daughters of rebecca the sunday school children and citizens generally which followed the senator to the court house he bustled about the room long after every one else was seated and loudly cried order in the dead silence which preceded the introduction of the senator by gen boswell the occasion was one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance and one he long dwelt on with pleasure this not being an edition of the congressional globe it is impossible to give senator dilworthys speech in full he began somewhat as follows fellow citizens it gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with you to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and burdensome station and confer in familiar converse with my friends in your great state the good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections is the sweetest solace in all my anxieties i look forward with longing to the time when i can lay aside the cares of office dam sight shouted a tipsy fellow near the door cries of put him out my friends do not remove him let the misguided man stay i see that he is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and sapping the foundation of society as i was saying when i can lay down the cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such sweet peaceful intelligent wideawake and patriotic place as hawkeye applause i have traveled much i have seen all parts of our glorious union but i have never seen a lovelier village than yours or one that has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity more applause the senator then launched into a sketch of our great country and dwelt for an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened it he then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion and upon the necessity of private purity if we were to have any public morality i trust he said that there are children within the sound of my voice and after some remarks to them the senator closed with an apostrophe to the genius of american liberty walking with the sunday school in one hand and temperance in the other up the glorified steps of the national capitol col sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so influential a person as the senator the desirability of improving the navigation of columbus river he and mr brierly took the senator over to napoleon and opened to him their plan it was a plan that the senator could understand without a great deal of explanation for he seemed to be familiar with the like improvements elsewhere when however they reached stones landing the senator looked about him and inquired is this napoleon this is the nucleus the nucleus said the colonel unrolling his map here is the deepo the church the city hall and so on ah i see how far from here is columbus river does that stream empty that why thats goose run thar aint no columbus thoutn its over to hawkeye interrupted one of the citizens who had come out to stare at the strangers a railroad come here last summer but it haint been here no mo yes sir the colonel hastened to explain in the old records columbus river is called goose run you see how it sweeps round the town fortynine miles to the missouri sloop navigation all the way pretty much drains this whole country when its improved steamboats will run right up here its got to be enlarged deepened you see by the map columbus river this country must have water communication youll want a considerable appropriation col sellers i should say a million is that your figure mr brierly according to our surveys said harry a million would do it a million spent on the river would make napoleon worth two millions at least i see nodded the senator but youd better begin by asking only for two or three hundred thousand the usual way you can begin to sell town lots on that appropriation you know the senator himself to do him justice was not very much interested in the country or the stream but he favored the appropriation and he gave the colonel and mr brierly to and understand that he would endeavor to get it through harry who thought he was shrewd and understood washington suggested an interest but he saw that the senator was wounded by the suggestion you will offend me by repeating such an observation he said whatever i do will be for the public interest it will require a portion of the appropriation for necessary expenses and i am sorry to say that there are members who will have to be seen but you can reckon upon my humble services this aspect of the subject was not again alluded to the senator possessed himself of the facts not from his observation of the ground but from the lips of col sellers and laid the appropriation scheme away among his other plans for benefiting the public it was on this visit also that the senator made the acquaintance of mr washington hawkins and was greatly taken with his innocence his guileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon any plan proposed col sellers was pleased to see this interest that washington had awakened especially since it was likely to further his expectations with regard to the tennessee lands the senator having remarked to the colonel that he delighted to help any deserving young man when the promotion of a private advantage could at the same time be made to contribute to the general good and he did not doubt that this was an opportunity of that kind the result of several conferences with washington was that the senator proposed that he should go to washington with him and become his private secretary and the secretary of his committee a proposal which was eagerly accepted the senator spent sunday in hawkeye and attended church he cheered the heart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his sympathy in his labors and by many inquiries in regard to the religious state of the region it was not a very promising state and the good man felt how much lighter his task would be if he had the aid of such a man as senator dilworthy i am glad to see my dear sir said the senator that you give them the doctrines it is owing to a neglect of the doctrines that there is such a fearful falling away in the country i wish that we might have you in washington as chaplain now in the senate the good man could not but be a little flattered and if sometimes thereafter in his discouraging work he allowed the thought that he might perhaps be called to washington as chaplain of the senate to cheer him who can wonder the senators commendation at least did one service for him it elevated him in the opinion of hawkeye laura was at church alone that day and mr brierly walked home with her a part of their way lay with that of general boswell and senator dilworthy and introductions were made laura had her own reasons for wishing to know the senator and the senator was not a man who could be called indifferent to charms such as hers that meek young lady so commended herself to him in the short walk that he announced his intentions of paying his respects to her the next day an intention which harry received glumly and when the senator was out of hearing he called him an old fool fie said laura i do believe you are jealous harry he is a very pleasant man he said you were a young man of great promise the senator did call next day and the result of his visit was that he was confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very attractive to ladies he saw laura again and again daring his stay and felt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty which every man felt who came near her harry was beside himself with rage while the senator remained in town he declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher game and he attributed his own illluck to the senators appearance the fellow was in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his brains out in chagrin perhaps laura enjoyed his torment but she soothed him with blandishments that increased his ardor and she smiled to herself to think that he had with all his protestations of love never spoken of marriage probably the vivacious fellow never had thought of it at any rate when he at length went away from hawkeye he was no nearer it but there was no telling to what desperate lengths his passion might not carry him laura bade him good bye with tender regret which however did not disturb her peace or interfere with her plans the visit of senator dilworthy had become of more importance to her and it by and by bore the fruit she longed for in an invitation to visit his family in the national capital during the winter session of congress chapter xxi o lift your natures up embrace our aims work out your freedom girls knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed drink deep until the habits of the slave the sins of emptiness gossip and spite and slander die the princess whether medicine is a science or only an empirical method of getting a living out of the ignorance of the human race ruth found before her first term was over at the medical school that there were other things she needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical books and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more general culture does your doctor know any thing i dont mean about medicine but about things in general is he a man of information and good sense once asked an old practitioner if he doesnt know any thing but medicine the chance is he doesnt know that the close application to her special study was beginning to tell upon ruths delicate health also and the summer brought with it only weariness and indisposition for any mental effort in this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the unexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever tiresome she followed with more interest philips sparkling account of his life in the west and longed for his experiences and to know some of those people of a world so different from here who alternately amused and displeased him he at least was learning the world the good and the bad of it as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it but what ruth wrote could a woman do tied up by custom and cast into particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible to extricate herself philip thought that he would go some day and extricate ruth but he did not write that for he had the instinct to know that this was not the extrication she dreamed of and that she must find out by her own experience what her heart really wanted philip was not a philosopher to be sure but he had the old fashioned notion that whatever a womans theories of life might be she would come round to matrimony only give her time he could indeed recall to mind one woman and he never knew a nobler whose whole soul was devoted and who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent project in singleness of life who yielded to the touch of matrimony as an icicle yields to a sunbeam neither at home nor elsewhere did ruth utter any complaint or admit any weariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked out for herself but her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with infirmity and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful composure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to her she saw plainly enough that ruth needed an entire change of scene and of occupation and perhaps she believed that such a change with the knowledge of the world it would bring would divert ruth from a course for which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted it therefore suited the wishes of all concerned when autumn came that ruth should go away to school she selected a large new england seminary of which she had often heard philip speak which was attended by both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education thither she went in september and began for the second time in the year a life new to her the seminary was the chief feature of fallkill a village of two to three thousand inhabitants it was a prosperous school with three hundred students a large corps of teachers men and women and with a venerable rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the town the students lodged and boarded in private families in the place and so it came about that while the school did a great deal to support the town the town gave the students society and the sweet influences of home life it is at least respectful to say that the influences of home life are sweet ruths home by the intervention of philip was in a family one of the rare exceptions in life or in fiction that had never known better days the montagues it is perhaps well to say had intended to come over in the mayflower but were detained at delft haven by the illness of a child they came over to massachusetts bay in another vessel and thus escaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors of the mayflower pilgrims have descended having no factitious weight of dignity to carry the montagues steadily improved their condition from the day they landed and they were never more vigorous or prosperous than at the date of this narrative with character compacted by the rigid puritan discipline of more than two centuries they had retained its strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness and were now blossoming under the generous modern influences squire oliver montague a lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in rare cases dwelt in a square old fashioned new england mansion a quarter of a mile away from the green it was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample fields about it and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road and on the west commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle slopes and nodding were now blossoming under the generous modern influences squire oliver montague a lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in rare cases dwelt in a square old fashioned new england groves but it was just a plain roomy house capable of extending to many guests an unpretending hospitality the family consisted of the squire and his wife a son and a daughter married and not at home a son in college at cambridge another son at the seminary and a daughter alice who was a year or more older than ruth having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable desires and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a pleasure the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely attained and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent if ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home there were evidences of culture of intellectual activity and of a zest in the affairs of all the world which greatly impressed her every room had its bookcases or bookshelves and was more or less a library upon every table was liable to be a litter of new books fresh periodicals and daily newspapers there were plants in the sunny windows and some choice engravings on the walls with bits of color in oil or watercolors the piano was sure to be open and strewn with music and there were photographs and little souvenirs here and there of foreign travel an absence of any whatpots in the corners with rows of cheerful shells and hindoo gods and chinese idols and nests of use less boxes of lacquered wood might be taken as denoting a languidness in the family concerning foreign missions but perhaps unjustly at any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable house and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day of the new books and of authors of boston radicalism and new york civilization and the virtue of congress that small gossip stood a very poor chance all this was in many ways so new to ruth that she seemed to have passed into another world in which she experienced a freedom and a mental exhilaration unknown to her before under this influence she entered upon her studies with keen enjoyment finding for a time all the relaxation she needed in the charming social life at the montague house it is strange she wrote to philip in one of her occasional letters that you never told me more about this delightful family and scarcely mentioned alice who is the life of it just the noblest girl unselfish knows how to do so many things with lots of talent with a dry humor and an odd way of looking at things and yet quiet and even serious often one of your capable new england girls we shall be great friends it had never occurred to philip that there was any thing extraordinary about the family that needed mention he knew dozens of girls like alice he thought to himself but only one like ruth good friends the two girls were from the beginning ruth was a study to alice the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience so much a child in some things so much a woman in others and ruth in turn it must be confessed probing alice sometimes with her serious grey eyes wondered what her object in life was and whether she had any purpose beyond living as she now saw her for she could scarcely conceive of a life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of some definite work and she hadno doubt that in her own case everything else would yield to the professional career she had marked out so you know philip sterling said ruth one day as the girls sat at their sewing ruth never embroidered and never sewed when she could avoid it bless her oh yes we are old friends philip used to come to fallkill often while he was in college he was once rusticated here for a term rusticated suspended for some college scrape he was a great favorite here father and he were famous friends father said that philip had no end of nonsense in him and was always blundering into something but he was a royal good fellow and would come out all right did you think he was fickle why i never thought whether he was or not replied alice looking up i suppose he was always in love with some girl or another as college boys are he used to make me his confidant now and then and be terribly in the dumps why did he come to you pursued ruth you were younger than he im sure i dont know he was at our house a good deal once at a picnic by the lake at the risk of his own life he saved sister millie from drowning and we all liked to have him here perhaps he thought as he had saved one sister the other ought to help him when he was in trouble i dont know the fact was that alice was a person who invited confidences because she never betrayed them and gave abundant sympathy in return there are persons whom we all know to whom human confidences troubles and heartaches flow as naturally its streams to a placid lake this is not a history of fallkill nor of the montague family worthy as both are of that honor and this narrative cannot be diverted into long loitering with them if the reader visits the village today he will doubtless be pointed out the montague dwelling where ruth lived the crosslots path she traversed to the seminary and the venerable chapel with its cracked bell in the little society of the place the quaker girl was a favorite and no considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete without her there was something in this seemingly transparent and yet deep character in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society about her and in her not seldom absorption in herself that would have made her long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to recall her to mind to the surprise of alice ruth took to the small gaieties of the village with a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted her life to a serious profession from the highest motives alice liked society well enough she thought but there was nothing exciting in that of fallkill nor anything novel in the attentions of the wellbred young gentlemen one met in it it must have worn a different aspect to ruth for she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity and then with interest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one would have deemed possible for her parties picnics rowingmatches moonlight strolls nutting expeditions in the october woods alice declared that it was a whirl of dissipation the fondness of ruth which was scarcely disguised for the company of agreeable young fellows who talked nothings gave alice opportunity for no end of banter do you look upon them as i subjects dear she would ask and ruth laughed her merriest laugh and then looked sober again perhaps she was thinking after all whether she knew herself if you should rear a duck in the heart of the sahara no doubt it would swim if you brought it to the nile surely no one would have predicted when ruth left philadelphia that she would become absorbed to this extent and so happy in a life so unlike that she thought she desired but no one can tell how a woman will act under any circumstances the reason novelists nearly always fail in depicting women when they make them act is that they let them do what they have observed some woman has done at sometime or another and that is where they make a mistake for a woman will never do again what has been done before it is this uncertainty that causes women considered as materials for fiction to be so interesting to themselves and to others as the fall went on and the winter ruth did not distinguish herself greatly at the fallkill seminary as a student a fact that apparently gave her no anxiety and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of power which had awakened within her chapter xxii in midwinter an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants of the montague house and to the friends of the young ladies who sought their society this was the arrival at the sassacua hotel of two young gentlemen from the west it is the fashion in new england to give indian names to the public houses not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel but that his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter there and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is allowed to depart with his scalp safe the two young gentlemen were neither students for the fallkill seminary nor lecturers on physiology nor yet life assurance solicitors three suppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at the hotel in respect to the names of philip sterling and henry brierly missouri on the register they were handsome enough fellows that was evident browned by outdoor exposure and with a free and lordly way about them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself indeed he very soon set down mr brierly as a gentleman of large fortune with enormous interests on his shoulders harry had a way of casually mentioning western investments through lines the freighting business and the route through the indian territory to lower california which was calculated to give an importance to his lightest word youve a pleasant town here sir and the most comfortable looking hotel ive seen out of new york said harry to the clerk we shall stay here a few days if you can give us a roomy suite of apartments harry usually had the best of everything wherever he went as such fellows always do have in this accommodating world philip would have been quite content with less expensive quarters but there was no resisting harrys generosity in such matters railroad surveying and realestate operations were at a standstill during the winter in missouri and the young men had taken advantage of the lull to come east philip to see if there was any disposition in his friends the railway contractors to give him a share in the salt lick union pacific extension and harry to open out to his uncle the prospects of the new city at stones landing and to procure congressional appropriations for the harbor and for making goose run navigable harry had with him a map of that noble stream and of the harbor with a perfect network of railroads centering in it pictures of wharves crowded with steamboats and of huge grainelevators on the bank all of which grew out of the combined imaginations of col sellers and mr brierly the colonel had entire confidence in harrys influence with wall street and with congressmen to bring about the consummation of their scheme and he waited his return in the empty house at hawkeye feeding his pinched family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a reckless prodigality dont let em into the thing more than is necessary says the colonel to harry give em a small interest a lot apiece in the suburbs of the landing ought to do a congressman but i reckon youll have to mortgage a part of the city itself to the brokers harry did not find that eagerness to lend money on stones landing in wall street which col sellers had expected it had seen too many such maps as he exhibited although his uncle and some of the brokers looked with more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of columbus river and were not disinclined to form a company for that purpose an appropriation was a tangible thing if you could get hold of it and it made little difference what it was appropriated for so long as you got hold of it pending these weighty negotiations philip has persuaded harry to take a little run up to fallkill a not difficult task for that young man would at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the west at sight of a new and pretty face and he had it must be confessed a facility in love making which made it not at all an interference with the more serious business of life he could not to be sure conceive how philip could be interested in a young lady who was studying medicine but he had no objection to going for he did not doubt that there were other girls in fallkill who were worth a weeks attention the young men were received at the house of the montagues with the hospitality which never failed there we are glad to see you again exclaimed the squire heartily you are welcome mr brierly any friend of phils is welcome at our house its more like home to me than any place except my own home cried philip as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general handshaking its a long time though since you have been here to say so alice said with her fathers frankness of manner and i suspect we owe the visit now to your sudden interest in the fallkill seminary philips color came as it had an awkward way of doing in his telltale face but before he could stammer a reply harry came in with that accounts for phils wish to build a seminary at stones landing our place in missouri when col sellers insisted it should be a university phil appears to have a weakness for seminaries it would have been better for your friend sellers retorted philip if he had had a weakness for district schools col sellers miss alice is a great friend of harrys who is always trying to build a house by beginning at the top i suppose its as easy to build a university on paper as a seminary and it looks better was harrys reflection at which the squire laughed and said he quite agreed with him the old gentleman understood stones landing a good deal better than he would have done after an hours talk with either of its expectant proprietors at this moment and while philip was trying to frame a question that he found it exceedingly difficult to put into words the door opened quietly and ruth entered taking in the group with a quick glance her eye lighted up and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with philip she was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial that it made that hero of the west feel somehow young and very ill at ease for months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it to himself a hundred times but he had never imagined it would be like this he should meet ruth unexpectedly as she was walking alone from the school perhaps or entering the room where he was waiting for her and she would cry oh phil and then check herself and perhaps blush and philip calm but eager and enthusiastic would reassure her by his warm manner and he would take her hand impressively and she would look up timidly and after his long absence perhaps he would be permitted to good heavens how many times he had come to this point and wondered if it could happen so well well he had never supposed that he should be the one embarrassed and above all by a sincere and cordial welcome we heard you were at the sassacus house were ruths first words and this i suppose is your friend i beg your pardon philip at length blundered out this is mr brierly of whom i have written you and ruth welcomed harry with a friendliness that philip thought was due to his friend to be sure but which seemed to him too level with her reception of himself but which harry received as his due from the other sex questions were asked about the journey and about the west and the conversation became a general one until philip at length found himself talking with the squire in relation to land and railroads and things he couldnt keep his mind on especially as he heard ruth and harry in an animated discourse and caught the words new york and opera and reception and knew that harry was giving his imagination full range in the world of fashion harry knew all about the opera green room and all at least he said so and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining stories of their plots telling how the soprano came in here and the basso here humming the beginning of their airs tumtitumtiti suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the basso recitative down among the dead men and touching off the whole with an airy grace quite captivating though he couldnt have sung a single air through to save himself and he hadnt an ear to know whether it was sung correctly all the same he doted on the opera and kept a box there into which he lounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene and meet his society friends if ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the disposal of ruth and her friends needless to say that she was delighted with the offer when she told philip of it that discreet young fellow only smiled and said that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in new york some evening when harry had not already given the use of his private box to some other friend the squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and urged them to stay at his house and alice joined in the invitation but philip had reasons for declining they staid to supper however and in the evening philip had a long talk apart with ruth a delightful hour to him in which she spoke freely of herself as of old of her studies at philadelphia and of her plans and she entered into his adventures and prospects in the west with a genuine and almost sisterly interest an interest however which did not exactly satisfy philip it was too general and not personal enough to suit him and with all her freedom in speaking of her own hopes philip could not detect any reference to himself in them whereas he never undertook anything that he did not think of ruth in connection with it he never made a plan that had not reference to her and he never thought of anything as complete if she could not share it fortune reputation these had no value to him except in ruths eyes and there were times when it seemed to him that if ruth was not on this earth he should plunge off into some remote wilderness and live in a purposeless seclusion i hoped said philip to get a little start in connection with this new railroad and make a little money so that i could came east and engage in something more suited to my tastes i shouldnt like to live in the west would you it never occurred to me whether i would or not was the unembarrassed reply one of our graduates went to chicago and has a nice practice there i dont know where i shall go it would mortify mother dreadfully to have me driving about philadelphia in a doctors gig philip laughed at the idea of it and does it seem as necessary to you to do it as it did before you came to fallkill it was a home question and went deeper than philip knew for ruth at once thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen and ladies of her acquaintance in the village but she was reluctant to admit to herself that her notions of a career had undergone any change oh i dont think i should come to fallkill to practice but i must do something when i am through school and why not medicine philip would like to have explained why not but the explanation would be of no use if it were not already obvious to ruth harry was equally in his element whether instructing squire montague about the investment of capital in missouri the improvement of columbus river the project he and some gentlemen in new york had for making a shorter pacific connection with the mississippi than the present one or diverting mrs montague with his experience in cooking in camp or drawing for miss alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of new england and the border where he had been harry was a very entertaining fellow having his imagination to help his memory and telling his stories as if he believed them as perhaps he did alice was greatly amused with harry and listened so seriously to his romancing that he exceeded his usual limits chance allusions to his bachelor establishment in town and the place of his family on the hudson could not have been made by a millionaire more naturally i should think queried alice you would rather stay in new york than to try the rough life at the west you have been speaking of oh adventure says harry i get tired of new york and besides i got involved in some operations that i had to see through parties in new york only last week wanted me to go down into arizona in a big diamond interest i told them no no speculation for me ive got my interests in missouri and i wouldnt leave philip as long as he stays there when the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel mr philip who was not in very good humor broke out what the deuce harry did you go on in that style to the montagues for go on cried harry why shouldnt i try to make a pleasant evening and besides aint i going to do those things what difference does it make about the mood and tense of a mere verb didnt uncle tell me only last saturday that i might as well go down to arizona and hunt for diamonds a fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one nonsense youll get to believing your own romancing by and by well youll see when sellers and i get that appropriation ill show you an establishment in town and another on the hudson and a box at the opera yes it will be like col sellers plantation at hawkeye did you ever see that now dont be cross phil shes just superb that little woman you never told me whos just superb growled philip fancying this turn of the conversation less than the other well mrs montague if you must know and harry stopped to light a cigar and then puffed on in silence the little quarrel didnt last over night for harry never appeared to cherish any illwill half a second and philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing and he had invited harry to come with him the young gentlemen stayed in fallkill a week and were every day at the montagues and took part in the winter gaieties of the village there were parties here and there to which the friends of ruth and the montagues were of course invited and harry in the generosity of his nature gave in return a little supper at the hotel very simple indeed with dancing in the hall and some refreshments passed round and philip found the whole thing in the bill when he came to pay it before the week was over philip thought he had a new light on the character of ruth her absorption in the small gaieties of the society there surprised him he had few opportunities for serious conversation with her there was always some butterfly or another flitting about and when philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased ruth laughed merrily enough and rallied him on his soberness she declared he was getting to be grim and unsocial he talked indeed more with alice than with ruth and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in his mind it needed in fact no word from him for she saw clearly enough what was going forward and knew her sex well enough to know there was no remedy for it but time ruth is a dear girl philip and has as much firmness of purpose as ever but dont you see she has just discovered that she is fond of society dont you let her see you are selfish about it is my advice the last evening they were to spend in fallkill they were at the montagues and philip hoped that he would find ruth in a different mood but she was never more gay and there was a spice of mischief in her eye and in her laugh confound it said philip to himself shes in a perfect twitter he would have liked to quarrel with her and fling himself out of the house in tragedy style going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off miles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain of the stars as people do in novels but he had no opportunity for ruth was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times and fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and halfconfidences she even said thee to him once in reproach for a cutting speech he began and the sweet little word made his heart beat like a triphammer for never in all her life had she said thee to him before was she fascinated with harrys careless bon homie and gay assurance both chatted away in high spirits and made the evening whirl along in the most mirthful manner ruth sang for harry and that young gentleman turned the leaves for her at the piano and put in a bass note now and then where he thought it would tell yes it was a merry evening and philip was heartily glad when it was over and the long leavetaking with the family was through with farewell philip good night mr brierly ruths clear voice sounded after them as they went down the walk and she spoke harrys name last thought philip chapter xxiii o see ye not yon narrow road so thick beset wi thorns and briers that is the path of righteousness though after it but few inquires and see ye not yon braid braid road that lies across the lily leven that is the path of wickedness though some call it the road to heaven thomas the rhymer phillip and harry reached new york in very different states of mind harry was buoyant he found a letter from col sellers urging him to go to washington and confer with senator dilworthy the petition was in his hands it had been signed by everybody of any importance in missouri and would be presented immediately i should go on myself wrote the colonel but i am engaged in the invention of a process for lighting such a city as st louis by means of water just attach my machine to the waterpipes anywhere and the decomposition of the fluid begins and you will have floods of light for the mere cost of the machine ive nearly got the lighting part but i want to attach to it a heating cooking washing and ironing apparatus its going to be the great thing but wed better keep this appropriation going while i am perfecting it harry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from mr duff brown each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses where they were well known as men engaged in large private operations for the public good and men besides who in the slang of the day understood the virtues of addition division and silence senator dilworthy introduced the petition into the senate with the remark that he knew personally the signers of it that they were men interested it was true in the improvement of the country but he believed without any selfish motive and that so far as he knew the signers were loyal it pleased him to see upon the roll the names of many colored citizens and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to know that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part in the development of the resources of their native land he moved the reference of the petition to the proper committee senator dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members as a person who was very well informed about the salt lick extension of the pacific and was one of the engineers who had made a careful survey of columbus river and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show the connection between the public treasury the city of napoleon and legislation for the benefit off the whole country harry was the guest of senator dilworthy there was scarcely any good movement in which the senator was not interested his house was open to all the laborers in the field of total abstinence and much of his time was taken up in attending the meetings of this cause he had a bible class in the sunday school of the church which he attended and he suggested to harry that he might take a class during the time he remained in washington mr washington hawkins had a class harry asked the senator if there was a class of young ladies for him to teach and after that the senator did not press the subject philip if the truth must be told was not well satisfied with his western prospects nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with the railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises opportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in missouri but for himself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of the profession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon during the summer he had made considerable practical advance in the science of engineering he had been diligent and made himself to a certain extent necessary to the work he was engaged on the contractors called him into their consultations frequently as to the character of the country he had been over and the cost of constructing the road the nature of the work etc still philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or money as an engineer he had a great deal of hard study before him and it is to his credit that he did not shrink from it while harry was in washington dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making the acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it philip devoted himself day and night with an energy and a concentration he was capable of to the learning and theory of his profession and to the science of railroad building he wrote some papers at this time for the plow the loom and the anvil upon the strength of materials and especially upon bridgebuilding which attracted considerable attention and were copied into the english practical magazine they served at any rate to raise philip in the opinion of his friends the contractors for practical men have a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen and though they may a little despise the talent they are quite ready to make use of it philip sent copies of his performances to ruths father and to other gentlemen whose good opinion he coveted but he did not rest upon his laurels indeed so diligently had he applied himself that when it came time for him to return to the west he felt himself at least in theory competent to take charge of a division in the field chapter xxiv the capital of the great republic was a new world to countrybred washington hawkins st louis was a greater city but its floating population did not hail from great distances and so it had the general family aspect of the permanent population but washington gathered its people from the four winds of heaven and so the manners the faces and the fashions there presented a variety that was infinite washington had never been in society in st louis and he knew nothing of the ways of its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their dwellings consequently everything in the nature of modern fashion and grandeur was a new and wonderful revelation to him washington is an interesting city to any of us it seems to become more and more interesting the oftener we visit it perhaps the reader has never been there very well you arrive either at night rather too late to do anything or see anything until morning or you arrive so early in the morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an hour or two while the sun bothers along over the atlantic you cannot well arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour because the railway corporation that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the town or out of it take care of that you arrive in tolerably good spirits because it is only thirtyeight miles from baltimore to the capital and so you have only been insulted three times provided you are not in a sleeping car the average is higher there once when you renewed your ticket after stopping over in baltimore once when you were about to enter the ladies car without knowing it was a ladys car and once when you asked the conductor at what hour you would reach washington you are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake their whips in your face as you step out upon the sidewalk you enter what they regard as a carriage in the capital and you wonder why they do not take it out of service and put it in the museum we have few enough antiquities and it is little to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve the few we have you reach your hotel presently and here let us draw the curtain of charity because of course you have gone to the wrong one you being a stranger how could you do otherwise there are a hundred and eighteen bad hotels and only one good one the most renowned and popular hotel of them all is perhaps the worst one known to history it is winter and night when you arrived it was snowing when you reached the hotel it was sleeting when you went to bed it was raining during the night it froze hard and the wind blew some chimneys down when you got up in the morning it was foggy when you finished your breakfast at ten oclock and went out the sunshine was brilliant the weather balmy and delicious and the mud and slush deep and allpervading you will like the climate when you get used to it you naturally wish to view the city so you take an umbrella an overcoat and a fan and go forth the prominent features you soon locate and get familiar with first you glimpse the ornamental upper works of a long snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees and a tall graceful white dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and pleasantly contrasting with the background of blue sky that building is the capitol gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was to cost and that the government did come within of building it for that sum you stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view and it is a very noble one you understand the capitol stands upon the verge of a high piece of table land a fine commanding position and its front looks out over this noble situation for a city but it dont see it for the reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon the property owners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures that the people went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh behind the temple of liberty so now the lordly front of the building with its imposing colonades its projecting graceful wings its picturesque groups of statuary and its long terraced ranges of steps flowing down in white marble waves to the ground merely looks out upon a sorrowful little desert of cheap boarding houses so you observe that you take your view from the back of the capitol and yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome by the way because to get there you must pass through the great rotunda and to do that you would have to see the marvelous historical paintings that hang there and the basreliefs and what have you done that you should suffer thus and besides you might have to pass through the old part of the building and you could not help seeing mr lincoln as petrified by a young lady artist for and you might take his marble emancipation proclamation which he holds out in his hand and contemplates for a folded napkin and you might conceive from his expression and his attitude that he is finding fault with the washing which is not the case nobody knows what is the matter with him but everybody feels for him well you ought not to go into the dome anyhow because it would be utterly impossible to go up there without seeing the frescoes in it and why should you be interested in the delirium tremens of art the capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building both within and without but you need not examine it now still if you greatly prefer going into the dome go now your general glance gives you picturesque stretches of gleaming water on your left with a sail here and there and a lunatic asylum on shore over beyond the water on a distant elevation you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells upon lovingly through a blur of unmanly moisture for it recalls your lost boyhood and the parthenons done in molasses candy which made it blest and beautiful still in the distance but on this side of the water and close to its edge the monument to the father of his country towers out of the mud sacred soil is the customary term it has the aspect of a factory chimney with the top broken off the skeleton of a decaying scaffolding lingers about its summit and tradition says that the spirit of washington often comes down and sits on those rafters to enjoy this tribute of respect which the nation has reared as the symbol of its unappeasable gratitude the monument is to be finished some day and at that time our washington will have risen still higher in the nations veneration and will be known as the greatgreatgrandfather of his country the memorial chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality that is full of reposeful expression with a glass you can see the cowsheds about its base and the contented sheep nimbling pebbles in the desert solitudes that surround it and the tired pigs dozing in the holy calm of its protecting shadow now you wrench your gaze loose and you look down in front of you and see the broad pennsylvania avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile or more till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared granite pile the treasury buildingan edifice that would command respect in any capital the stores and hotels that wall in this broad avenue are mean and cheap and dingy and are better left without comment beyond the treasury is a fine large white barn with wide unhandsome grounds about it the president lives there it is ugly enough outside but that is nothing to what it is inside dreariness flimsiness bad taste reduced to mathematical completeness is what the inside offers to the eye if it remains yet what it always has been the front and right hand views give you the city at large it is a wide stretch of cheap little brick houses with here and there a noble architectural pile lifting itself out of the midstgovernment buildings these if the thaw is still going on when you come down and go about town you will wonder at the shortsightedness of the city fathers when you come to inspect the streets in that they do not dilute the mud a little more and use them for canals if you inquire around a little you will find that there are more boardinghouses to the square acre in washington than there are in any other city in the land perhaps if you apply for a home in one of them it will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe eye and then ask you if you are a member of congress perhaps just as a pleasantry you will say yes and then she will tell you that she is full then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper and there she stands convicted and ashamed she will try to blush and it will be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed she shows you her rooms now and lets you take one but she makes you pay in advance for it that is what you will get for pretending to be a member of congress if you had been content to be merely a private citizen your trunk would have been sufficient security for your board if you are curious and inquire into this thing the chances are that your landlady will be illnatured enough to say that the person and property of a congressman are exempt from arrest or detention and that with the tears in her eyes she has seen several of the peoples representatives walk off to their several states and territories carrying her unreceipted board bills in their pockets for keepsakes and before you have been in washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe her too of course you contrive to see everything and find out everything and one of the first and most startling things you find out is that every individual you encounter in the city of washington almost and certainly every separate and distinct individual in the public employment from the highest bureau chief clear down to the maid who scrubs department halls the night watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy who purifies the department spittoons represents political influence unless you can get the ear of a senator or a congressman or a chief of a bureau or department and persuade him to use his influence in your behalf you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature in washington mere merit fitness and capability are useless baggage to you without influence the population of washington consists pretty much entirely of government employee and the people who board them there are thousands of these employees and they have gathered there from every corner of the union and got their berths through the intercession command is nearer the word of the senators and representatives of their respective states it would be an odd circumstance to see a girl get employment at three or four dollars a week in one of the great public cribs without any political grandee to back her but merely because she was worthy and competent and a good citizen of a free country that treats all persons alike washington would be mildly thunderstruck at such a thing as that if you are a member of congress no offence and one of your constituents who doesnt know anything and does not want to go into the bother of learning something and has no money and no employment and cant earn a living comes besieging you for help do you say come my friend if your services were valuable you could get employment elsewhere dont want you here oh no you take him to a department and say here give this person something to pass away the time at and a salary and the thing is done you throw him on his country he is his countrys child let his country support him there is something good and motherly about washington the grand old benevolent national asylum for the helpless the wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the liberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor such of them as are immediately employed about the two houses of congress are not only liberally paid also but are remembered in the customary extra compensation bill which slides neatly through annually with the general grab that signalizes the last night of a session and thus twenty per cent is added to their wages for for fun no doubt washington hawkins new life was an unceasing delight to him senator dilworthy lived sumptuously and washingtons quarters were charming gas running water hot and cold bathroom coalfires rich carpets beautiful pictures on the walls books on religion temperance public charities and financial schemes trim colored servants dainty food everything a body could wish for and as for stationery there was no end to it the government furnished it postage stamps were not needed the senators frank could convey a horse through the mails if necessary and then he saw such dazzling company renowned generals and admirals who had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west went in and out before him or sat at the senators table solidified into palpable flesh and blood famous statesmen crossed his path daily that once rare and aweinspiring being a congressman was become a common spectacle a spectacle so common indeed that he could contemplate it without excitement even without embarrassment foreign ministers were visible to the naked eye at happy intervals he had looked upon the president himself and lived and more this world of enchantment teemed with speculation the whole atmosphere was thick with hand that indeed was washington hawkins native air none other refreshed his lungs so gratefully he had found paradise at last the more he saw of his chief the senator the more he honored him and the more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to stand out to possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a man washington said in a letter to louise was a happy fortune for a young man whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his the weeks drifted by harry brierly flirted danced added lustre to the brilliant senatorial receptions and diligently buzzed and buttonholed congressmen in the interest of the columbus river scheme meantime senator dilworthy labored hard in the same interest and in others of equal national importance harry wrote frequently to sellers and always encouragingly and from these letters it was easy to see that harry was a pet with all washington and was likely to carry the thing through that the assistance rendered him by old dilworthy was pretty fair pretty fair and every little helps you know said harry washington wrote sellers officially now and then in one of his letters it appeared that whereas no member of the house committee favored the scheme at first there was now needed but one more vote to compass a majority report closing sentence providence seems to further our efforts signed abner dilworthy u s s per washington hawkins p s at the end of a week washington was able to send the happy news officially as usual that the needed vote had been added and the bill favorably reported from the committee other letters recorded its perils in committee of the whole and by and by its victory by just the skin of its teeth on third reading and final passage then came letters telling of mr dilworthys struggles with a stubborn majority in his own committee in the senate of how these gentlemen succumbed one by one till a majority was secured then there was a hiatus washington watched every move on the board and he was in a good position to do this for he was clerk of this committee and also one other he received no salary as private secretary but these two clerkships procured by his benefactor paid him an aggregate of twelve dollars a day without counting the twenty percent extra compensation which would of course be voted to him on the last night of the session he saw the bill go into committee of the whole and struggle for its life again and finally worry through in the fullness of time he noted its second reading and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal came and it was put upon its final passage washington listened with bated breath to the aye no no aye of the voters for a few dread minutes and then could bear the suspense no longer he ran down from the gallery and hurried home to wait at the end of two or three hours the senator arrived in the bosom of his family and dinner was waiting washington sprang forward with the eager question on his lips and the senator said we may rejoice freely now my son providence has crowned our efforts with success chapter xxv washington sent grand good news to col sellers that night to louise he wrote it is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart is full of thankfulness for some manifestation of the divine favor you shall know him some day my louise and knowing him you will honor him as i do harry wrote i pulled it through colonel but it was a tough job there is no question about that there was not a friend to the measure in the house committee when i began and not a friend in the senate committee except old dil himself but they were all fixed for a majority report when i hauled off my forces everybody here says you cant get a thing like this through congress without buying committees for straightout cash on delivery but i think ive taught them a thing or two if i could only make them believe it when i tell the old residenters that this thing went through without buying a vote or making a promise they say thats rather too thin and when i say thin or not thin its a fact anyway they say come now but do you really believe that and when i say i dont believe anything about it i know it they smile and say well you are pretty innocent or pretty blind one or the other theres no getting around that why they really do believe that votes have been bought they do indeed but let them keep on thinking so i have found out that if a man knows how to talk to women and has a little gift in the way of argument with men he can afford to play for an appropriation against a money bag and give the money bag odds in the game weve raked in of uncle sams money say what they will and there is more where this came from when we want it and i rather fancy i am the person that can go in and occupy it too if i do say it myself that shouldnt perhaps ill be with you within a week scare up all the men you can and put them to work at once when i get there i propose to make things hum the great news lifted sellers into the clouds he went to work on the instant he flew hither and thither making contracts engaging men and steeping his soul in the ecstasies of business he was the happiest man in missouri and louise was the happiest woman for presently came a letter from washington which said rejoice with me for the long agony is over we have waited patiently and faithfully all these years and now at last the reward is at hand a man is to pay our family for the tennessee land it is but a little sum compared to what we could get by waiting but i do so long to see the day when i can call you my own that i have said to myself better take this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best days in this miserable separation besides i can put this money into operations here that will increase it a hundred fold yes a thousand fold in a few months the air is full of such chances and i know our family would consent in a moment that i should put in their shares with mine without a doubt we shall be worth half a million dollars in a year from this time i put it at the very lowest figure because it is always best to be on the safe side half a million at the very lowest calculation and then your father will give his consent and we can marry at last oh that will be a glorious day tell our friends the good news i want all to share it and she did tell her father and mother but they said let it be kept still for the present the careful father also told her to write washington and warn him not to speculate with the money but to wait a little and advise with one or two wise old heads she did this and she managed to keep the good news to herself though it would seem that the most careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her radiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended upon her harry joined the colonel at stones landing and that dead place sprang into sudden life a swarm of men were hard at work and the dull air was filled with the cheery music of labor harry had been constituted engineeringeneral and he threw the full strength of his powers into his work he moved among his hirelings like a king authority seemed to invest him with a new splendor col sellers as general superintendent of a great public enterprise was all that a mere human being could be and more these two grandees went at their imposing improvement with the air of men who had been charged with the work of altering the foundations of the globe they turned their first attention to straightening the river just above the landing where it made a deep bend and where the maps and plans showed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance but increase the fall they started a cutoff canal across the peninsula formed by the bend and such another tearing up of the earth and slopping around in the mud as followed the order to the men had never been seen in that region before there was such a panic among the turtles that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found within three miles of stones landing they took the young and the aged the decrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tidewater in disorderly procession the tadpoles following and the bullfrogs bringing up the rear saturday night came but the men were obliged to wait because the appropriation had not come harry said he had written to hurry up the money and it would be along presently so the work continued on monday stones landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity by this time sellers threw a lot or two on the market as a feeler and they sold well he reclothed his family laid in a good stock of provisions and still had money left he started a bank account in a small way and mentioned the deposit casually to friends and to strangers too to everybody in fact but not as a new thing on the contrary as a matter of lifelong standing he could not keep from buying trifles every day that were not wholly necessary it was such a gaudy thing to get out his bankbook and draw a check instead of using his old customary formula charge it harry sold a lot or two also and had a dinner party or two at hawkeye and a general good time with the money both men held on pretty strenuously for the coming big prices however at the end of a month things were looking bad harry had besieged the new york headquarters of the columbus river slackwater navigation company with demands then commands and finally appeals but to no purpose the appropriation did not come the letters were not even answered the workmen were clamorous now the colonel and harry retired to consult whats to be done said the colonel hangd if i know company say anything not a word you telegraphed yesterday yes and the day before too no answer noneconfound them then there was a long pause finally both spoke at once ive got it ive got it whats yours said harry give the boys thirtyday orders on the company for the back pay thats itthats my own idea to a dot but then but then yes i know said the colonel i know they cant wait for the orders to go to new york and be cashed but whats the reason they cant get them discounted in hawkeye of course they can that solves the difficulty everybody knows the appropriations been made and the companys perfectly good so the orders were given and the men appeased though they grumbled a little at first the orders went well enough for groceries and such things at a fair discount and the work danced along gaily for a time two or three purchasers put up frame houses at the landing and moved in and of course a farsighted but easygoing journeyman printer wandered along and started the napoleon weekly telegraph and literary repository a paper with a latin motto from the unabridged dictionary and plenty of fat conversational tales and doubleleaded poetry all for two dollars a year strictly in advance of course the merchants forwarded the orders at once to new york and never heard of them again at the end of some weeks harrys orders were a drug in the market nobody would take them at any discount whatever the second month closed with a riot sellers was absent at the time and harry began an active absence himself with the mob at his heels but being on horseback he had the advantage he did not tarry in hawkeye but went on thus missing several appointments with creditors he was far on his flight eastward and well out of danger when the next morning dawned he telegraphed the colonel to go down and quiet the laborers he was bound east for money everything would be right in a week tell the men so tell them to rely on him and not be afraid sellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the landing they had gutted the navigation office then piled the beautiful engraved stockbooks and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the bonfire while it lasted they had a liking for the colonel but still they had some idea of hanging him as a sort of makeshift that might answer after a fashion in place of more satisfactory game but they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first within fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all rich men he gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of stones landing within a mile and a half of the future post office and railway station and they promised to resume work as soon as harry got east and started the money along now things were blooming and pleasant again but the men had no money and nothing to live on the colonel divided with them the money he still had in bank an act which had nothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide whatever he had with anybody that wanted it and it was owing to this very trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were pinched with famine when the mens minds had cooled and sellers was gone they hated themselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches but it was too late now they agreed to hang him another time such time as providence should appoint chapter xxvi rumors of ruths frivolity and worldliness at fallkill traveled to philadelphia in due time and occasioned no little undertalk among the bolton relatives hannah shoecraft told another cousin that for her part she never believed that ruth had so much more mind than other people and cousin hulda added that she always thought ruth was fond of admiration and that was the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend meeting the story that ruth was engaged to a young gentleman of fortune in fallkill came with the other news and helped to give point to the little satirical remarks that went round about ruths desire to be a doctor margaret bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these rumors they might be true she knew a womans nature too well to think them improbable but she also knew how steadfast ruth was in her purposes and that as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances and sports by the way and yet keeps on to the sea it was in ruths nature to give back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness and pleasure to appear idly delaying even and sporting in the sunshine while the current of her resolution flowed steadily on that ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she could for instance be interested in that somewhat serious byplay called flirtation or take any delight in the exercise of those little arts of pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and charming because they are not intellectual ruth herself had never suspected until she went to fallkill she had believed it her duty to subdue her gaiety of temperament and let nothing divert her from what are called serious pursuits in her limited experience she brought everything to the judgment of her own conscience and settled the affairs of all the world in her own serene judgment hall perhaps her mother saw this and saw also that there was nothing in the friends society to prevent her from growing more and more opinionated when ruth returned to philadelphia it must be confessed though it would not have been by her that a medical career did seem a little less necessary for her than formerly and coming back in a glow of triumph as it were and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a lively society and in new and sympathetic friendship she anticipated pleasure in an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the society at home and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle which were so agreeable at fallkill she expected visits from her new friends she would have company the new books and the periodicals about which all the world was talking and in short she would have life for a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought with her her mother was delighted with this change in her with the improvement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home affairs her father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he did few things besides he liked her mirthful and teasing ways and not less a keen battle over something she had read he had been a great reader all his life and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with encyclopaedic information it was one of ruths delights to cram herself with some out of the way subject and endeavor to catch her father but she almost always failed mr bolton liked company a house full of it and the mirth of young people and he would have willingly entered into any revolutionary plans ruth might have suggested in relation to friends society but custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic and rebellious young lady as ruth very soon found in spite of all her brave efforts her frequent correspondence and her determined animation her books and her music she found herself settling into the clutches of the old monotony and as she realized the hopelessness of her endeavors the medical scheme took new hold of her and seemed to her the only method of escape mother thee does not know how different it is in fallkill how much more interesting the people are one meets how much more life there is but thee will find the world child pretty much all the same when thee knows it better i thought once as thee does now and had as little thought of being a friend as thee has perhaps when thee has seen more thee will better appreciate a quiet life thee married young i shall not marry young and perhaps not at all said ruth with a look of vast experience perhaps thee doesnt know thee own mind i have known persons of thy age who did not did thee see anybody whom thee would like to live with always in fallkill not always replied ruth with a little laugh mother i think i wouldnt say always to any one until i have a profession and am as independent as he is then my love would be a free act and not in any way a necessity margaret bolton smiled at this newfangled philosophy thee will find that love ruth is a thing thee wont reason about when it comes nor make any bargains about thee wrote that philip sterling was at fallkill yes and henry brierly a friend of his a very amusing young fellow and not so seriousminded as philip but a bit of a fop maybe and thee preferred the fop to the seriousminded i didnt prefer anybody but henry brierly was good company which philip wasnt always did thee know thee father had been in correspondence with philip ruth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes oh its not about thee what then and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone probably ruth herself did not know it its about some land up in the country that man bigler has got father into another speculation that odious man why will father have anything to do with him is it that railroad yes father advanced money and took land as security and whatever has gone with the money and the bonds he has on his hands a large tract of wild land and what has philip to do with that it has good timber if it could ever be got out and father says that there must be coal in it its in a coal region he wants philip to survey it and examine it for indications of coal its another of fathers fortunes i suppose said ruth he has put away so many fortunes for us that im afraid we never shall find them ruth was interested in it nevertheless and perhaps mainly because philip was to be connected with the enterprise mr bigler came to dinner with her father next day and talked a great deal about mr boltons magnificent tract of land extolled the sagacity that led him to secure such a property and led the talk along to another railroad which would open a northern communication to this very land pennybacker says its full of coal hes no doubt of it and a railroad to strike the erie would make it a fortune suppose you take the land and work the thing up mr bigler you may have the tract for three dollars an acre youd throw it away then replied mr bigler and im not the man to take advantage of a friend but if youll put a mortgage on it for the northern road i wouldnt mind taking an interest if pennybacker is willing but pennybacker you know dont go much on land he sticks to the legislature and mr bigler laughed when mr bigler had gone ruth asked her father about philips connection with the land scheme theres nothing definite said mr bolton philip is showing aptitude for his profession i hear the best reports of him in new york though those sharpers dont intend to do anything but use him ive written and offered him employment in surveying and examining the land we want to know what it is and if there is anything in it that his enterprise can dig out he shall have an interest i should be glad to give the young fellow a lift all his life eli bolton had been giving young fellows a lift and shouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately his ledger takeitaltogether would not show a balance on the right side but perhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world where accounts are kept on a different basis the left hand of the ledger will appear the right looked at from the other side philip wrote to ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of the city of napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme of harrys flight and the colonels discomfiture harry left in such a hurry that he hadnt even time to bid miss laura hawkins goodbye but he had no doubt that harry would console himself with the next pretty face he saw a remark which was thrown in for ruths benefit col sellers had in all probability by this time some other equally brilliant speculation in his brain as to the railroad philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept on foot for speculative purposes in wall street and he was about to quit it would ruth be glad to hear he wondered that he was coming east for he was coming in spite of a letter from harry in new york advising him to hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard to contracts he to be a little careful about sellers who was somewhat visionary harry said the summer went on without much excitement for ruth she kept up a correspondence with alice who promised a visit in the fall she read she earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people as came to the house but she found herself falling more and more into reveries and growing weary of things as they were she felt that everybody might become in time like two relatives from a shaker establishment in ohio who visited the boltons about this time a father and son clad exactly alike and alike in manners the son however who was not of age was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father he always addressed his parent as brother plum and bore himself altogether in such a superior manner that ruth longed to put bent pins in his chair both father and son wore the long single breasted collarless coats of their society without buttons before or behind but with a row of hooks and eyes on either side in front it was ruths suggestion that the coats would be improved by a single hook and eye sewed on in the small of the back where the buttons usually are amusing as this shaker caricature of the friends was it oppressed ruth beyond measure and increased her feeling of being stifled it was a most unreasonable feeling no home could be pleasanter than ruths the house a little out of the city was one of those elegant country residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of philadelphia a modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth could suggest for comfort it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept lawns with groups of trees parterres of flowers massed in colors with greenhouse grapery and garden and on one side the garden sloped away in undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang under forest trees the country about teas the perfection of cultivated landscape dotted with cottages and stately mansions of revolutionary date and sweet as an english countryside whether seen in the soft bloom of may or in the mellow ripeness of late october it needed only the peace of the mind within to make it a paradise one riding by on the old germantown road and seeing a young girl swinging in the hammock on the piazza and intent upon some volume of old poetry or the latest novel would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic he could not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of reports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere ruth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her had been as unsubstantial as a dream perhaps she so thought it i feel she once said to her father as if i were living in a house of cards and thee would like to turn it into a hospital no but tell me father continued ruth not to be put off is thee still going on with that bigler and those other men who come here and entice thee mr bolton smiled as men do when they talk with women about business such men have their uses ruth they keep the world active and i owe a great many of my best operations to such men who knows ruth but this new land purchase which i confess i yielded a little too much to bigler in may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children ah father thee sees every thing in a rosecolored light i do believe thee wouldnt have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine if it hadnt had the novelty of an experiment to thee and is thee satisfied with it if thee means if i have had enough of it no i just begin to see what i can do in it and what a noble profession it is for a woman would thee have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to come and put me in a cage mr bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs and he did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that very day which was entirely characteristic of him ruth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of cards although the bolton household had no idea of the number of perils that hovered over them any more than thousands of families in america have of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity and luxury hang a sudden call upon mr bolton for a large sum of money which must be forthcoming at once had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures from no one of which a dollar could be realized it was in vain that he applied to his business acquaintances and friends it was a period of sudden panic and no money a hundred thousand mr bolton said plumly good god if you should ask me for ten i shouldnt know where to get it and yet that day mr small pennybacker bigler and small came to mr bolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation if he could not raise ten thousand dollars only ten and he was sure of a fortune without it he was a beggar mr bolton had already smalls notes for a large amount in his safe labeled doubtful he had helped him again and again and always with the same result but mr small spoke with a faltering voice of his family his daughter in school his wife ignorant of his calamity and drew such a picture of their agony that mr bolton put by his own more pressing necessity and devoted the day to scraping together here and there ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar who had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt beautiful credit the foundation of modern society who shall say that this is not the golden age of mutual trust of unlimited reliance upon human promises that is a peculiar condition of society which enables a whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar newspaper anecdote which puts into the mouth of a distinguished speculator in lands and mines this remark i wasnt worth a cent two years ago and now i owe two millions of dollars chapter xxvii it was a hard blow to poor sellers to see the work on his darling enterprise stop and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been such refreshment to his soul sicken and die out it was hard to come down to humdrum ordinary life again after being a general superintendent and the most conspicuous man in the community it was sad to see his name disappear from the newspapers sadder still to see it resurrected at intervals shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and clothed on with rhetorical tar and feathers but his friends suffered more on his account than he did he was a cork that could not be kept under the water many moments at a time he had to bolster up his wifes spirits every now and then on one of these occasions he said its all right my dear all right it will all come right in a little while theres coming and that will set things booming again harry seems to be having some difficulty but thats to be expected you cant move these big operations to the tune of fishers hornpipe you know but harry will get it started along presently and then youll see i expect the news every day now but beriah youve been expecting it every day all along havent you well yes yes i dont know but i have but anyway the longer its delayed the nearer it grows to the time when it will start same as every day you live brings you nearer to nearer the grave well no not that exactly but you cant understand these things polly dear women havent much head for business you know you make yourself perfectly comfortable old lady and youll see how well trot this right along why bless you let the appropriation lag if it wants to thats no great matter theres a bigger thing than that bigger than beriah bigger child why whats pocket money mere pocket money look at the railroad did you forget the railroad it aint many months till spring it will be coming right along and the railroad swimming right along behind it wherell it be by the middle of summer just stop and fancy a moment just think a little dont anything suggest itself bless your heart you dear women live right in the present all the time but a man why a man lives in the future beriah but dont we live in the future most too much beriah we do somehow seem to manage to live on next years crop of corn and potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along but sometimes its not a robust diet beriah but dont look that way dear dont mind what i say i dont mean to fret i dont mean to worry and i dont once a month do i dear but when i get a little low and feel bad i get a bit troubled and worrisome but it dont mean anything in the world it passes right away i know youre doing all you can and i dont want to seem repining and ungrateful for im not beriah you know im not dont you lord bless you child i know you are the very best little woman that ever lived that ever lived on the whole face of the earth and i know that i would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and scheme for you with all my might and ill bring things all right yet honey cheer up and dont you fear the railroad oh i had forgotten the railroad dear but when a body gets blue a body forgets everything yes the railroad tell me about the railroad aha my girl dont you see things aint so dark are they now i didnt forget the railroad now just think for a moment just figure up a little on the future dead moral certainties for instance call this waiter st louis and well lay this fork representing the railroad from st louis to this potato which is slouchburg then with this carving knife well continue the railroad from slouchburg to doodleville shown by the black pepper then we run along the yes the comb to the tumbler thats brimstone thence by the pipe to belshazzar which is the saltcellar thence to to that quill catfish hand me the pincushion marie antoinette thence right along these shears to this horse babylon then by the spoon to bloody run thank you the ink thence to hail columbia snuffers polly please move that cup and saucer close up thats hail columbia then let me open my knife to harkfromthetomb where well put the candlestick only a little distance from hail columbia to harkfromthetomb downgrade all the way and there we strike columbus river pass me two or throe skeins of thread to stand for the river the sugar bowl will do for hawkeye and the rat trap for stones landingnapoleon i mean and you can see how much better napoleon is located than hawkeye now here you are with your railroad complete and showing its continuation to hallelujah and thence to corruptionville now thenthem you are its a beautiful road beautiful jeff thompson can outengineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through an aneroid or a theodolite or whatever they call it he calls it sometimes one and sometimes the other just whichever levels off his sentence neatest i reckon but aint it a ripping toad though i tell you itll make a stir when it gets along just see what a country it goes through theres your onions at slouchburg noblest onion country that graces gods footstool and theres your turnip country all around doodleville bless my life what fortunes are going to be made there when they get that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of turnips if theres any in them and i reckon there is because congress has made an appropriation of money to test the thing and they wouldnt have done that just on conjecture of course and now we come to the brimstone region cattle raised there till you cant rest and corn and all that sort of thing then youve got a little stretch along through belshazzar that dont produce anything now at least nothing but rocks but irrigation will fetch it then from catfish to babylon its a little swampy but theres dead loads of peat down under there somewhere next is the bloody run and hail columbia country tobacco enough can be raised there to support two such railroads next is the sassparilla region i reckon theres enough of that truck along in there on the line of the pocketknife from hail columbia to harkfromthe tomb to fat up all the consumptives in all the hospitals from halifax to the holy land it just grows like weeds ive got a little belt of sassparilla land in there just tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my little universal expectorant to get into shape in my head and ill fix that you know one of these days ill have all the nations of the earth expecto but beriah dear dont interrupt me polly i dont want you to lose the run of the map well take your toyhorse james fitzjames if you must have it and run along with you here now the soap will do for babylon let me see where was i oh yes now we run down to stones lan napoleon now we run down to napoleon beautiful road look at that now perfectly straight linestraight as the way to the grave and see where it leaves hawkeyeclear out in the cold my dear clear out in the cold that towns as bound to die as well if i owned it id get its obituary ready now and notify the mourners polly mark my words in three years from this hawkeyell be a howling wilderness youll see and just look at that river noblest stream that meanders over the thirsty earth calmest gentlest artery that refreshes her weary bosom railroad goes all over it and all through it wades right along on stilts seventeen bridges in three miles and a half fortynine bridges from harkfromthetomb to stones landing altogether forty nine bridges and culverts enough to culvert creation itself hadnt skeins of thread enough to represent them all but you get an idea perfect trestlework of bridges for seventy two miles jeff thompson and i fixed all that you know hes to get the contracts and im to put them through on the divide just oceans of money in those bridges its the only part of the railroad im interested in down along the line and its all i want too its enough i should judge now here we are at napoleon good enough country plenty good enough all it wants is population thats all right that will come and its no bad country now for calmness and solitude i can tell you though theres no money in that of course no money but a man wants rest a man wants peace a man dont want to rip and tear around all the time and here we go now just as straight as a string for hallelujah its a beautiful angle handsome up grade all the way and then away you go to corruptionville the gaudiest country for early carrots and cauliflowers that ever good missionary field too there aint such another missionary field outside the jungles of central africa and patriotic why they named it after congress itself oh i warn you my dear theres a good time coming and itll be right along before you know what youre about too that railroads fetching it you see what it is as far as ive got and if i had enough bottles and soap and bootjacks and such things to carry it along to where it joins onto the union pacific fourteen hundred miles from here i should exhibit to you in that little internal improvement a spectacle of inconceivable sublimity so dont you see weve got the rail road to fall back on and in the meantime what are we worrying about that appropriation for thats all right id be willing to bet anything that the very next letter that comes from harry will the eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter warm from the postoffice things do look bright after all beriah im sorry i was blue but it did seem as if everything had been going against us for whole ages open the letter open it quick and lets know all about it before we stir out of our places i am all in a fidget to know what it says the letter was opened without any unnecessary delay chapter xxviii whatever may have been the language of harrys letter to the colonel the information it conveyed was condensed or expanded one or the other from the following episode of his visit to new york he called with official importance in his mien at no wall street where a great gilt sign betokened the presence of the headquarters of the columbus river slackwater navigation company he entered and gave a dressy porter his card and was requested to wait a moment in a sort of anteroom the porter returned in a minute and asked whom he would like to see the president of the company of course he is busy with some gentlemen sir says he will be done with them directly that a copperplate card with engineerinchief on it should be received with such tranquility as this annoyed mr brierly not a little but he had to submit indeed his annoyance had time to augment a good deal for he was allowed to cool his heels a frill half hour in the anteroom before those gentlemen emerged and he was ushered into the presence he found a stately dignitary occupying a very official chair behind a long green moroccocovered table in a room with sumptuously carpeted and furnished and well garnished with pictures good morning sir take a seat take a seat thank you sir said harry throwing as much chill into his manner as his ruffled dignity prompted we perceive by your reports and the reports of the chief superintendent that you have been making gratifying progress with the work we are all very much pleased indeed we did not discover it from your letters which we have not received nor by the treatment our drafts have met with which were not honored nor by the reception of any part of the appropriation no part of it having come to hand why my dear mr brierly there must be some mistake i am sure we wrote you and also mr sellers recently when my clerk comes he will show copies letters informing you of the ten per cent assessment oh certainly we got those letters but what we wanted was money to carry on the work money to pay the men certainly certainly true enough but we credited you both for a large part of your assessments i am sure that was in our letters of course that was in i remember that ah very well then now we begin to understand each other well i dont see that we do theres two months wages due the men and how havent you paid the men paid them how are we going to pay them when you dont honor our drafts why my dear sir i cannot see how you can find any fault with us i am sure we have acted in a perfectly straight forward business way now let us look at the thing a moment you subscribed for shares of the capital stock at a share i believe yes sir i did and mr sellers took a like amount yes sir very well no concern can get along without money we levied a ten per cent assessment it was the original understanding that you and mr sellers were to have the positions you now hold with salaries of a month each while in active service you were duly elected to these places and you accepted them am i right certainly very well you were given your instructions and put to work by your reports it appears that you have expended the sum of upon the said work two months salary to you two officers amounts altogether to about oneeighth of your ten per cent assessment you see which leaves you in debt to the company for the other seveneighths of the assessment viz something over apiece now instead of requiring you to forward this aggregate of or to new york the company voted unanimously to let you pay it over to the contractors laborers from time to time and give you credit on the books for it and they did it without a murmur too for they were pleased with the progress you had made and were glad to pay you that little compliment and a very neat one it was too i am sure the work you did fell short of a trifle let me see from salary added ah yes the balance due the company from yourself and mr sellers is which i will take the responsibility of allowing to stand for the present unless you prefer to draw a check now and thus confound it do you mean to say that instead of the company owing us we owe the company well yes and that we owe the men and the contractors nearly ten thousand dollars besides owe them oh bless my soul you cant mean that you have not paid these people but i do mean it the president rose and walked the floor like a man in bodily pain his brows contracted he put his hand up and clasped his forehead and kept saying oh it is too bad too bad too bad oh it is bound to be found out nothing can prevent it nothing then he threw himself into his chair and said my dear mr brierson this is dreadful perfectly dreadful it will be found out it is bound to tarnish the good name of the company our credit will be seriously most seriously impaired how could you be so thoughtless the men ought to have been paid though it beggared us all they ought ought they then why the devil my name is not bryerson by the way why the mischief didnt the compa why what in the nation ever became of the appropriation where is that appropriation if a stockholder may make so bold as to ask the appropriation that paltry do you mean of course but i didnt know that was so very paltry though i grant of course that it is not a large sum strictly speaking but where is it my dear sir you surprise me you surely cannot have had a large acquaintance with this sort of thing otherwise you would not have expected much of a result from a mere initial appropriation like that it was never intended for anything but a mere nest egg for the future and real appropriations to cluster around indeed well was it a myth or was it a reality whatever become of it why the matter is simple enough a congressional appropriation costs money just reflect for instance a majority of the house committee say apiece a majority of the senate committee the same each say a little extra to one or two chairman of one or two such committees say each and theres of the money gone to begin with then seven male lobbyists at each one female lobbyist a high moral congressman or senator here and there the high moral ones cost more because they give tone to a measure say ten of these at each is then a lot of smallfry country members who wont vote for anything whatever without pay say twenty at apiece is a lot of dinners to members say altogether lot of jimcracks for congressmens wives and children those go a long way you cant sped too much money in that line well those things cost in a lump say along there somewhere and then comes your printed documents your maps your tinted engravings your pamphlets your illuminated show cards your advertisements in a hundred and fifty papers at ever so much a line because youve got to keep the papers all light or you are gone up you know oh my dear sir printing bills are destruction itself ours so far amount to let me see and then theres well never mind the details the total in clean numbers foots up thus far what oh yes indeed printings no bagatelle i can tell you and then theres your contributions as a company to chicago fires and boston fires and orphan asylums and all that sort of thing head the list you see with the companys full name and a thousand dollars set opposite great card sir one of the finest advertisements in the world the preachers mention it in the pulpit when its a religious charity one of the happiest advertisements in the world is your benevolent donation ours have amounted to sixteen thousand dollars and some cents up to this time good heavens oh yes perhaps the biggest thing weve done in the advertising line was to get an officer of the u s government of perfectly himmalayan official altitude to write up our little internal improvement for a religious paper of enormous circulation i tell you that makes our bonds go handsomely among the pious poor your religious paper is by far the best vehicle for a thing of this kind because theyll lead your article and put it right in the midst of the reading matter and if its got a few scripture quotations in it and some temperance platitudes and a bit of gush here and there about sunday schools and a sentimental snuffle now and then about gods precious ones the honest hardhanded poor it works the nation like a charm my dear sir and never a man suspects that it is an advertisement but your secular paper sticks you right into the advertising columns and of course you dont take a trick give me a religious paper to advertise in every time and if youll just look at their advertising pages youll observe that other people think a good deal as i do especially people who have got little financial schemes to make everybody rich with of course i mean your great big metropolitan religious papers that know how to serve god and make money at the same time thats your sort sir thats your sort a religious paper that isnt run to make money is no use to us sir as an advertising medium no use to anybody in our line of business i guess our next best dodge was sending a pleasure trip of newspaper reporters out to napoleon never paid them a cent just filled them up with champagne and the fat of the land put pen ink and paper before them while they were redhot and bless your soul when you come to read their letters youd have supposed theyd been to heaven and if a sentimental squeamishness held one or two of them back from taking a less rosy view of napoleon our hospitalities tied his tongue at least and he said nothing at all and so did us no harm let me see have i stated all the expenses ive been at no i was near forgetting one or two items theres your official salaries you cant get good men for nothing salaries cost pretty lively and then theres your big highsounding millionaire names stuck into your advertisements as stockholders another card that and they are stockholders too but you have to give them the stock and nonassessable at that so theyre an expensive lot very very expensive thing take it all around is a big internal improvement concern but you see that yourself mr bryerman you see that yourself sir but look here i think you are a little mistaken about its ever having cost anything for congressional votes i happen to know something about that ive let you say your say now let me say mine i dont wish to seem to throw any suspicion on anybodys statements because we are all liable to be mistaken but how would it strike you if i were to say that i was in washington all the time this bill was pending and what if i added that i put the measure through myself yes sir i did that little thing and moreover i never paid a dollar for any mans vote and never promised one there are some ways of doing a thing that are as good as others which other people dont happen to think about or dont have the knack of succeeding in if they do happen to think of them my dear sir i am obliged to knock some of your expenses in the head for never a cent was paid a congressman or senator on the part of this navigation company the president smiled blandly even sweetly all through this harangue and then said is that so every word of it well it does seem to alter the complexion of things a little you are acquainted with the members down there of course else you could not have worked to such advantage i know them all sir i know their wives their children their babies i even made it a point to be on good terms with their lackeys i know every congressman well even familiarly very good do you know any of their signatures do you know their handwriting why i know their handwriting as well as i know my own have had correspondence enough with them i should think and their signatures why i can tell their initials even the president went to a private safe unlocked it and got out some letters and certain slips of paper then he said now here for instance do you believe that that is a genuine letter do you know this signature here and this one do you know who those initials represent and are they forgeries harry was stupefied there were things there that made his brain swim presently at the bottom of one of the letters he saw a signature that restored his equilibrium it even brought the sunshine of a smile to his face the president said that one amuses you you never suspected him of course i ought to have suspected him but i dont believe it ever really occurred to me well well well how did you ever have the nerve to approach him of all others why my friend we never think of accomplishing anything without his help he is our mainstay but how do those letters strike you they strike me dumb what a stoneblind idiot i have been well take it all around i suppose you had a pleasant time in washington said the president gathering up the letters of course you must have had very few men could go there and get a money bill through without buying a single come now mr president thats plenty of that i take back everything i said on that head im a wiser man today than i was yesterday i can tell you i think you are in fact i am satisfied you are but now i showed you these things in confidence you understand mention facts as much as you want to but dont mention names to anybody i can depend on you for that cant i oh of course i understand the necessity of that i will not betray the names but to go back a bit it begins to look as if you never saw any of that appropriation at all we saw nearly ten thousand dollars of it and that was all several of us took turns at logrolling in washington and if we had charged anything for that service none of that would ever have reached new york if you hadnt levied the assessment you would have been in a close place i judge close have you figured up the total of the disbursements i told you of no i didnt think of that well lets see spent in washington say printing advertising etc say charity say total the money to do that with comes from appropriation ten per cent assessment on capital of total which leaves us in debt some at this moment salaries of home officers are still going on also printing and advertising next month will show a state of things and then burst up i suppose by no means levy another assessment oh i see thats dismal by no means why isnt it whats the road out another appropriation dont you see bother the appropriations they cost more than they come to not the next one well call for half a million get it and go for a million the very next month yes but the cost of it the president smiled and patted his secret letters affectionately he said all these people are in the next congress we shant have to pay them a cent and what is more they will work like beavers for us perhaps it might be to their advantage harry reflected profoundly a while then he said we send many missionaries to lift up the benighted races of other lands how much cheaper and better it would be if those people could only come here and drink of our civilization at its fountain head i perfectly agree with you mr beverly must you go well good morning look in when you are passing and whenever i can give you any information about our affairs and prospects i shall be glad to do it harrys letter was not a long one but it contained at least the calamitous figures that came out in the above conversation the colonel found himself in a rather uncomfortable place no salary forthcoming and himself held responsible for half of the due the workmen to say nothing of being in debt to the company to the extent of nearly pollys heart was nearly broken the blues returned in fearful force and she had to go out of the room to hide the tears that nothing could keep back now there was mourning in another quarter too for louise had a letter washington had refused at the last moment to take for the tennessee land and had demanded so the trade fell through and now washington was wailing because he had been so foolish but he wrote that his man might probably return to the city soon and then he meant to sell to him sure even if he had to take louise had a good cryseveral of them indeed and the family charitably forebore to make any comments that would increase her grief spring blossomed summer came dragged its hot weeks by and the colonels spirits rose day by day for the railroad was making good progress but by and by something happened hawkeye had always declined to subscribe anything toward the railway imagining that her large business would be a sufficient compulsory influence but now hawkeye was frightened and before col sellers knew what he was about hawkeye in a panic had rushed to the front and subscribed such a sum that napoleons attractions suddenly sank into insignificance and the railroad concluded to follow a comparatively straight coarse instead of going miles out of its way to build up a metropolis in the muddy desert of stones landing the thunderbolt fell after all the colonels deep planning after all his brain work and tongue work in drawing public attention to his pet project and enlisting interest in it after all his faithful hard toil with his hands and running hither and thither on his busy feet after all his high hopes and splendid prophecies the fates had turned their backs on him at last and all in a moment his aircastles crumbled to ruins abort him hawkeye rose from her fright triumphant and rejoicing and down went stones landing one by one its meagre parcel of inhabitants packed up and moved away as the summer waned and fall approached town lots were no longer salable traffic ceased a deadly lethargy fell upon the place once more the weekly telegraph faded into an early grave the wary tadpole returned from exile the bullfrog resumed his ancient song the tranquil turtle sunned his back upon bank and log and drowsed his grateful life away as in the old sweet days of yore chapter xxix philip sterling was on his way to ilium in the state of pennsylvania ilium was the railway station nearest to the tract of wild land which mr bolton had commissioned him to examine on the last day of the journey as the railway train philip was on was leaving a large city a lady timidly entered the drawingroom car and hesitatingly took a chair that was at the moment unoccupied philip saw from the window that a gentleman had put her upon the car just as it was starting in a few moments the conductor entered and without waiting an explanation said roughly to the lady now you cant sit there that seats taken go into the other car i did not intend to take the seat said the lady rising i only sat down a moment till the conductor should come and give me a seat there aint any cars full youll have to leave but sir said the lady appealingly i thought cant help what you thought you must go into the other car the train is going very fast let me stand here till we stop the lady can have my seat cried philip springing up the conductor turned towards philip and coolly and deliberately surveyed him from head to foot with contempt in every line of his face turned his back upon him without a word and said to the lady come ive got no time to talk you must go now the lady entirely disconcerted by such rudeness and frightened moved towards the door opened it and stepped out the train was swinging along at a rapid rate jarring from side to side the step was a long one between the cars and there was no protecting grating the lady attempted it but lost her balance in the wind and the motion of the car and fell she would inevitably have gone down under the wheels if philip who had swiftly followed her had not caught her arm and drawn her up he then assisted her across found her a seat received her bewildered thanks and returned to his car the conductor was still there taking his tickets and growling something about imposition philip marched up to him and burst out with you are a brute an infernal brute to treat a woman that way perhaps youd like to make a fuss about it sneered the conductor philips reply was a blow given so suddenly and planted so squarely in the conductors face that it sent him reeling over a fat passenger who was looking up in mild wonder that any one should dare to dispute with a conductor and against the side of the car he recovered himself reached the bell rope damn you ill learn you stepped to the door and called a couple of brakemen and then as the speed slackened roared out get off this train i shall not get off i have as much right here as you well see said the conductor advancing with the brakemen the passengers protested and some of them said to each other thats too bad as they always do in such cases but none of them offered to take a hand with philip the men seized him wrenched him from his seat dragged him along the aisle tearing his clothes thrust him from the car and then flung his carpetbag overcoat and umbrella after him and the train went on the conductor red in the face and puffing from his exertion swaggered through the car muttering puppy ill learn him the passengers when he had gone were loud in their indignation and talked about signing a protest but they did nothing more than talk the next morning the hooverville patriot and clarion had this item slightually overboard we learn that as the down noon express was leaving h yesterday a lady god save the mark attempted to force herself into the already full palatial car conductor slum who is too old a bird to be caught with chaff courteously informed her that the car was full and when she insisted on remaining he persuaded her to go into the car where she belonged thereupon a young sprig from the east blustered like a shanghai rooster and began to sass the conductor with his chin music that gentleman delivered the young aspirant for a muss one of his elegant little lefthanders which so astonished him that he began to feel for his shooter whereupon mr slum gently raised the youth carried him forth and set him down just outside the car to cool off whether the young blood has yet made his way out of bascoms swamp we have not learned conductor slum is one of the most gentlemanly and efficient officers on the road but he aint trifled with not much we learn that the company have put a new engine on the seven oclock train and newly upholstered the drawingroom car throughout it spares no effort for the comfort of the traveling public philip never had been before in bascoms swamp and there was nothing inviting in it to detain him after the train got out of the way he crawled out of the briars and the mud and got upon the track he was somewhat bruised but he was too angry to mind that he plodded along over the ties in a very hot condition of mind and body in the scuffle his railway check had disappeared and he grimly wondered as he noticed the loss if the company would permit him to walk over their track if they should know he hadnt a ticket philip had to walk some five miles before he reached a little station where he could wait for a train and he had ample time for reflection at first he was full of vengeance on the company he would sue it he would make it pay roundly but then it occurred to him that he did not know the name of a witness he could summon and that a personal fight against a railway corporation was about the most hopeless in the world he then thought he would seek out that conductor lie in wait for him at some station and thrash him or get thrashed himself but as he got cooler that did not seem to him a project worthy of a gentleman exactly was it possible for a gentleman to get even with such a fellow as that conductor on the letters own plane and when he came to this point he began to ask himself if he had not acted very much like a fool he didnt regret striking the fellow he hoped he had left a mark on him but after all was that the best way here was he philip sterling calling himself a gentleman in a brawl with a vulgar conductor about a woman he had never seen before why should he have put himself in such a ridiculous position wasnt it enough to have offered the lady his seat to have rescued her from an accident perhaps from death suppose he had simply said to the conductor sir your conduct is brutal i shall report you the passengers who saw the affair might have joined in a report against the conductor and he might really have accomplished something and now philip looked at leis torn clothes and thought with disgust of his haste in getting into a fight with such an autocrat at the little station where philip waited for the next train he met a man who turned out to be a justice of the peace in that neighborhood and told him his adventure he was a kindly sort of man and seemed very much interested dum em said he when he had heard the story do you think any thing can be done sir wal i guess taint no use i haint a mite of doubt of every word you say but suins no use the railroad company owns all these people along here and the judges on the bench too spiled your clothes wal least saids soonest mended you haint no chance with the company when next morning he read the humorous account in the patriot and clarion he saw still more clearly what chance he would have had before the public in a fight with the railroad company still philips conscience told him that it was his plain duty to carry the matter into the courts even with the certainty of defeat he confessed that neither he nor any citizen had a right to consult his own feelings or conscience in a case where a law of the land had been violated before his own eyes he confessed that every citizens first duty in such case is to put aside his own business and devote his time and his best efforts to seeing that the infraction is promptly punished and he knew that no country can be well governed unless its citizens as a body keep religiously before their minds that they are the guardians of the law and that the law officers are only the machinery for its execution nothing more as a finality he was obliged to confess that he was a bad citizen and also that the general laxity of the time and the absence of a sense of duty toward any part of the community but the individual himself were ingrained in him am he was no better than the rest of the people the result of this little adventure was that philip did not reach ilium till daylight the next morning when he descended sleepy and sore from a way train and looked about him ilium was in a narrow mountain gorge through which a rapid stream ran it consisted of the plank platform on which he stood a wooden house half painted with a dirty piazza unroofed in front and a sign board hung on a slanting pole bearing the legend hotel p dusenheimer a sawmill further down the stream a blacksmithshop and a store and three or four unpainted dwellings of the slab variety as philip approached the hotel he saw what appeared to be a wild beast crouching on the piazza it did not stir however and he soon found that it was only a stuffed skin this cheerful invitation to the tavern was the remains of a huge panther which had been killed in the region a few weeks before philip examined his ugly visage and strong crooked forearm as he was waiting admittance having pounded upon the door yait a bit ill shoost put on my trowsers shouted a voice from the window and the door was soon opened by the yawning landlord morgen didnt hear d drain oncet dem boys geeps me up zo spate gom right in philip was shown into a dirty barroom it was a small room with a stove in the middle set in a long shallow box of sand for the benefit of the spitters a bar across one end a mere counter with a sliding glasscase behind it containing a few bottles having ambitious labels and a washsink in one corner on the walls were the bright yellow and black handbills of a traveling circus with pictures of acrobats in human pyramids horses flying in long leaps through the air and sylphlike women in a paradisaic costume balancing themselves upon the tips of their toes on the bare backs of frantic and plunging steeds and kissing their hands to the spectators meanwhile as philip did not desire a room at that hour he was invited to wash himself at the nasty sink a feat somewhat easier than drying his face for the towel that hung in a roller over the sink was evidently as much a fixture as the sink itself and belonged like the suspended brush and comb to the traveling public philip managed to complete his toilet by the use of his pockethandkerchief and declining the hospitality of the landlord implied in the remark you wond dake notin he went into the open air to wait for breakfast the country he saw was wild but not picturesque the mountain before him might be eight hundred feet high and was only a portion of a long unbroken range savagely wooded which followed the stream behind the hotel and across the brawling brook was another leveltopped wooded range exactly like it ilium itself seen at a glance was old enough to be dilapidated and if it had gained anything by being made a wood and water station of the new railroad it was only a new sort of grime and rawness p dusenheimer standing in the door of his uninviting groggery when the trains stopped for water never received from the traveling public any patronage except facetious remarks upon his personal appearance perhaps a thousand times he had heard the remark ilium fuit followed in most instances by a hail to himself as aeneas with the inquiry where is old anchises at first he had replied dere aint no such man but irritated by its senseless repetition he had latterly dropped into the formula of you be dam philip was recalled from the contemplation of ilium by the rolling and growling of the gong within the hotel the din and clamor increasing till the house was apparently unable to contain it when it burst out of the front door and informed the world that breakfast was on the table the dining room was long low and narrow and a narrow table extended its whole length upon this was spread a cloth which from appearance might have been as long in use as the towel in the barroom upon the table was the usual service the heavy much nicked stone ware the row of plated and rusty castors the sugar bowls with the zinc teaspoons sticking up in them the piles of yellow biscuits the discouragedlooking plates of butter the landlord waited and philip was pleased to observe the change in his manner in the barroom he was the conciliatory landlord standing behind his guests at table he had an air of peremptory patronage and the voice in which he shot out the inquiry as he seized philips plate beefsteak or liver quite took away philips power of choice he begged for a glass of milk after trying that green hued compound called coffee and made his breakfast out of that and some hard crackers which seemed to have been imported into ilium before the introduction of the iron horse and to have withstood a ten years siege of regular boarders greeks and others the land that philip had come to look at was at least five miles distant from ilium station a corner of it touched the railroad but the rest was pretty much an unbroken wilderness eight or ten thousand acres of rough country most of it such a mountain range as he saw at ilium his first step was to hire three woodsmen to accompany him by their help he built a log hut and established a camp on the land and then began his explorations mapping down his survey as he went along noting the timber and the lay of the land and making superficial observations as to the prospect of coal the landlord at ilium endeavored to persuade philip to hire the services of a witchhazel professor of that region who could walk over the land with his wand and tell him infallibly whether it contained coal and exactly where the strata ran but philip preferred to trust to his own study of the country and his knowledge of the geological formation he spent a month in traveling over the land and making calculations and made up his mind that a fine vein of coal ran through the mountain about a mile from the railroad and that the place to run in a tunnel was half way towards its summit acting with his usual promptness philip with the consent of mr bolton broke ground there at once and before snow came had some rude buildings up and was ready for active operations in the spring it was true that there were no outcroppings of coal at the place and the people at ilium said he mought as well dig for plug terbaccer there but philip had great faith in the uniformity of natures operations in ages past and he had no doubt that he should strike at this spot the rich vein that had made the fortune of the golden briar company chapter xxx once more louise had good news from her washington senator dilworthy was going to sell the tennessee land to the government louise told laura in confidence she had told her parents too and also several bosom friends but all of these people had simply looked sad when they heard the news except laura lauras face suddenly brightened under it only for an instant it is true but poor louise was grateful for even that fleeting ray of encouragement when next laura was alone she fell into a train of thought something like this if the senator has really taken hold of this matter i may look for that invitation to his house at any moment i am perishing to go i do long to know whether i am only simply a largesized pigmy among these pigmies here who tumble over so easily when one strikes them or whether i am really her thoughts drifted into other channels for a season then she continued he said i could be useful in the great cause of philanthropy and help in the blessed work of uplifting the poor and the ignorant if he found it feasible to take hold of our land well that is neither here nor there what i want is to go to washington and find out what i am i want money too and if one may judge by what she hears there are chances there for a for a fascinating woman she was going to say perhaps but she did not along in the fall the invitation came sure enough it came officially through brother washington the private secretary who appended a postscript that was brimming with delight over the prospect of seeing the duchess again he said it would be happiness enough to look upon her face once more it would be almost too much happiness when to it was added the fact that she would bring messages with her that were fresh from louises lips in washingtons letter were several important enclosures for instance there was the senators check for to buy suitable clothing in new york with it was a loan to be refunded when the land was sold two thousand this was fine indeed louises father was called rich but laura doubted if louise had ever had worth of new clothing at one time in her life with the check came two through tickets good on the railroad from hawkeye to washington via new york and they were deadhead tickets too which had been given to senator dilworthy by the railway companies senators and representatives were paid thousands of dollars by the government for traveling expenses but they always traveled deadhead both ways and then did as any honorable highminded men would naturally do declined to receive the mileage tendered them by the government the senator had plenty of railway passes and could easily spare two to laura one for herself and one for a male escort washington suggested that she get some old friend of the family to come with her and said the senator would deadhead him home again as soon as he had grown tired of the sights of the capital laura thought the thing over at first she was pleased with the idea but presently she began to feel differently about it finally she said no our staid steadygoing hawkeye friends notions and mine differ about some things they respect me now and i respect them better leave it so i will go alone i am not afraid to travel by myself and so communing with herself she left the house for an afternoon walk almost at the door she met col sellers she told him about her invitation to washington bless me said the colonel i have about made up my mind to go there myself you see weve got to get another appropriation through and the company want me to come east and put it through congress harrys there and hell do what he can of course and harrys a good fellow and always does the very best he knows how but then hes young rather young for some parts of such work you know and besides he talks too much talks a good deal too much and sometimes he appears to be a little bit visionary too i think the worst thing in the world for a business man a man like that always exposes his cards sooner or later this sort of thing wants an old quiet steady hand wants an old cool head you know that knows men through and through and is used to large operations im expecting my salary and also some dividends from the company and if they get along in time ill go along with you laura take you under my wing you mustnt travel alone lord i wish i had the money right now but therell be plenty soon plenty laura reasoned with herself that if the kindly simplehearted colonel was going anyhow what could she gain by traveling alone and throwing away his company so she told him she accepted his offer gladly gratefully she said it would be the greatest of favors if he would go with her and protect her not at his own expense as far as railway fares were concerned of course she could not expect him to put himself to so much trouble for her and pay his fare besides but he wouldnt hear of her paying his fare it would be only a pleasure to him to serve her laura insisted on furnishing the tickets and finally when argument failed she said the tickets cost neither her nor any one else a cent she had two of them she needed but one and if he would not take the other she would not go with him that settled the matter he took the ticket laura was glad that she had the check for new clothing for she felt very certain of being able to get the colonel to borrow a little of the money to pay hotel bills with here and there she wrote washington to look for her and col sellers toward the end of november and at about the time set the two travelers arrived safe in the capital of the nation sure enough chapter xxxi she the gracious lady yet no paines did spare to doe him ease or doe him remedy many restoratives of vertues rare and costly cordialles she did apply to mitigate his stubborne malady spensers faerie queens mr henry brierly was exceedingly busy in new york so he wrote col sellers but he would drop everything and go to washington the colonel believed that harry was the prince of lobbyists a little too sanguine may be and given to speculation but then he knew everybody the columbus river navigation scheme was got through almost entirely by his aid he was needed now to help through another scheme a benevolent scheme in which col sellers through the hawkinses had a deep interest i dont care you know he wrote to harry so much about the niggroes but if the government will buy this land it will set up the hawkins family make laura an heiress and i shouldnt wonder if beriah sellers would set up his carriage again dilworthy looks at it different of course hes all for philanthropy for benefiting the colored race theres old balsam was in the interior used to be the rev orson balsam of iowa hes made the riffle on the injun great injun pacificator and land dealer balaama got the injun to himself and i suppose that senator dilworthy feels that there is nothing left him but the colored man i do reckon he is the best friend the colored man has got in washington though harry was in a hurry to reach washington he stopped in philadelphia and prolonged his visit day after day greatly to the detriment of his business both in new york and washington the society at the boltons might have been a valid excuse for neglecting business much more important than his philip was there he was a partner with mr bolton now in the new coal venture concerning which there was much to be arranged in preparation for the spring work and philip lingered week after week in the hospitable house alice was making a winter visit ruth only went to town twice a week to attend lectures and the household was quite to mr boltons taste for he liked the cheer of company and something going on evenings harry was cordially asked to bring his travelingbag there and he did not need urging to do so not even the thought of seeing laura at the capital made him restless in the society of the two young ladies two birds in hand are worth one in the bush certainly philip was at home he sometimes wished he were not so much so he felt that too much or not enough was taken for granted ruth had met him when he first came with a cordial frankness and her manner continued entirely unrestrained she neither sought his company nor avoided it and this perfectly level treatment irritated him more than any other could have done it was impossible to advance much in lovemaking with one who offered no obstacles had no concealments and no embarrassments and whom any approach to sentimentality would be quite likely to set into a fit of laughter why phil she would say what puts you in the dumps to day you are as solemn as the upper bench in meeting i shall have to call alice to raise your spirits my presence seems to depress you its not your presence but your absence when you are present began philip dolefully with the idea that he was saying a rather deep thing but you wont understand me no i confess i cannot if you really are so low as to think i am absent when i am present its a frightful case of aberration i shall ask father to bring out dr jackson does alice appear to be present when she is absent alice has some human feeling anyway she cares for something besides musty books and dry bones i think ruth when i die said philip intending to be very grim and sarcastic ill leave you my skeleton you might like that it might be more cheerful than you are at times ruth replied with a laugh but you mustnt do it without consulting alice she might not like it i dont know why you should bring alice up on every occasion do you think i am in love with her bless you no it never entered my head are you the thought of philip sterling in love is too comical i thought you were only in love with the ilium coal mine which you and father talk about half the time this is a specimen of philips wooing confound the girl he would say to himself why does she never tease harry and that young shepley who comes here how differently alice treated him she at least never mocked him and it was a relief to talk with one who had some sympathy with him and he did talk to her by the hour about ruth the blundering fellow poured all his doubts and anxieties into her ear as if she had been the impassive occupant of one of those little wooden confessionals in the cathedral on logan square has a confessor if she is young and pretty any feeling does it mend the matter by calling her your sister philip called alice his good sister and talked to her about love and marriage meaning ruth as if sisters could by no possibility have any personal concern in such things did ruth ever speak of him did she think ruth cared for him did ruth care for anybody at fallkill did she care for anything except her profession and so on alice was loyal to ruth and if she knew anything she did not betray her friend she did not at any rate give philip too much encouragement what woman under the circumstances would i can tell you one thing philip she said if ever ruth bolton loves it will be with her whole soul in a depth of passion that will sweep everything before it and surprise even herself a remark that did not much console philip who imagined that only some grand heroism could unlock the sweetness of such a heart and philip feared that he wasnt a hero he did not know out of what materials a woman can construct a hero when she is in the creative mood harry skipped into this society with his usual lightness and gaiety his good nature was inexhaustible and though he liked to relate his own exploits he had a little tact in adapting himself to the tastes of his hearers he was not long in finding out that alice liked to hear about philip and harry launched out into the career of his friend in the west with a prodigality of invention that would have astonished the chief actor he was the most generous fellow in the world and picturesque conversation was the one thing in which he never was bankrupt with mr bolton he was the serious man of business enjoying the confidence of many of the monied men in new york whom mr bolton knew and engaged with them in railway schemes and government contracts philip who had so long known harry never could make up his mind that harry did not himself believe that he was a chief actor in all these large operations of which he talked so much harry did not neglect to endeavor to make himself agreeable to mrs bolton by paying great attention to the children and by professing the warmest interest in the friends faith it always seemed to him the most peaceful religion he thought it must be much easier to live by an internal light than by a lot of outward rules he had a dear quaker aunt in providence of whom mrs bolton constantly reminded him he insisted upon going with mrs bolton and the children to the friends meeting on first day when ruth and alice and philip worlds people went to a church in town and he sat through the hour of silence with his hat on in most exemplary patience in short this amazing actor succeeded so well with mrs bolton that she said to philip one day thy friend henry brierly appears to be a very worldly minded young man does he believe in anything oh yes said philip laughing he believes in more things than any other person i ever saw to ruth harry seemed to be very congenial he was never moody for one thing but lent himself with alacrity to whatever her fancy was he was gay or grave as the need might be no one apparently could enter more fully into her plans for an independent career my father said harry was bred a physician and practiced a little before he went into wall street i always had a leaning to the study there was a skeleton hanging in the closet of my fathers study when i was a boy that i used to dress up in old clothes oh i got quite familiar with the human frame you must have said philip was that where you learned to play the bones he is a master of those musical instruments ruth he plays well enough to go on the stage philip hates science of any kind and steady application retorted harry he didnt fancy philips banter and when the latter had gone out and ruth asked why dont you take up medicine mr brierly harry said i have it in mind i believe i would begin attending lectures this winter if it werent for being wanted in washington but medicine is particularly womens province why so asked ruth rather amused well the treatment of disease is a good deal a matter of sympathy a womans intuition is better than a mans nobody knows anything really you know and a woman can guess a good deal nearer than a man you are very complimentary to my sex but said harry frankly i should want to choose my doctor an ugly woman would ruin me the disease would be sure to strike in and kill me at sight of her i think a pretty physician with engaging manners would coax a fellow to live through almost anything i am afraid you are a scoffer mr brierly on the contrary i am quite sincere wasnt it old whats his name that said only the beautiful is useful whether ruth was anything more than diverted with harrys company philip could not determine he scorned at any rate to advance his own interest by any disparaging communications about harry both because he could not help liking the fellow himself and because he may have known that he could not more surely create a sympathy for him in ruths mind that ruth was in no danger of any serious impression he felt pretty sure felt certain of it when he reflected upon her severe occupation with her profession hang it he would say to himself she is nothing but pure intellect anyway and he only felt uncertain of it when she was in one of her moods of raillery with mocking mischief in her eyes at such times she seemed to prefer harrys society to his when philip was miserable about this he always took refuge with alice who was never moody and who generally laughed him out of his sentimental nonsense he felt at his ease with alice and was never in want of something to talk about and he could not account for the fact that he was so often dull with ruth with whom of all persons in the world he wanted to appear at his best harry was entirely satisfied with his own situation a bird of passage is always at its ease having no house to build and no responsibility he talked freely with philip about ruth an almighty fine girl he said but what the deuce she wanted to study medicine for he couldnt see there was a concert one night at the musical fund hall and the four had arranged to go in and return by the germantown cars it was philips plan who had engaged the seats and promised himself an evening with ruth walking with her sitting by her in the hall and enjoying the feeling of protecting that a man always has of a woman in a public place he was fond of music too in a sympathetic way at least he knew that ruths delight in it would be enough for him perhaps he meant to take advantage of the occasion to say some very serious things his love for ruth was no secret to mrs bolton and he felt almost sure that he should have no opposition in the family mrs bolton had been cautious in what she said but philip inferred everything from her reply to his own questions one day has thee ever spoken thy mind to ruth why shouldnt he speak his mind and end his doubts ruth had been more tricksy than usual that day and in a flow of spirits quite inconsistent it would seem in a young lady devoted to grave studies had ruth a premonition of philips intention in his manner it may be for when the girls came down stairs ready to walk to the cars and met philip and harry in the hall ruth said laughing the two tallest must walk together and before philip knew how it happened ruth had taken harrys arm and his evening was spoiled he had too much politeness and good sense and kindness to show in his manner that he was hit so he said to harry thats your disadvantage in being short and he gave alice no reason to feel during the evening that she would not have been his first choice for the excursion but he was none the less chagrined and not a little angry at the turn the affair took the hall was crowded with the fashion of the town the concert was one of those fragmentary drearinesses that people endure because they are fashionable tours de force on the piano and fragments from operas which have no meaning without the setting with weary pauses of waiting between there is the comic basso who is so amusing and on such familiar terms with the audience and always sings the barber the attitudinizing tenor with his languishing oh summer night the soprano with her batti batti who warbles and trills and runs and fetches her breath and ends with a noble scream that brings down a tempest of applause in the midst of which she backs off the stage smiling and bowing it was this sort of concert and philip was thinking that it was the most stupid one he ever sat through when just as the soprano was in the midst of that touching ballad comin thro the rye the soprano always sings comin thro the rye on an encore the black swan used to make it irresistible philip remembered with her arch if a body kiss a body there was a cry of fire the hall is long and narrow and there is only one place of egress instantly the audience was on its feet and a rush began for the door men shouted women screamed and panic seized the swaying mass a seconds thought would have convinced every one that getting out was impossible and that the only effect of a rush would be to crash people to death but a seconds thought was not given a few cried sit down sit down but the mass was turned towards the door women were down and trampled on in the aisles and stout men utterly lost to selfcontrol were mounting the benches as if to run a race over the mass to the entrance philip who had forced the girls to keep their seats saw in a flash the new danger and sprang to avert it in a second more those infuriated men would be over the benches and crushing ruth and alice under their boots he leaped upon the bench in front of them and struck out before him with all his might felling one man who was rushing on him and checking for an instant the movement or rather parting it and causing it to flow on either side of him but it was only for an instant the pressure behind was too great and the next philip was dashed backwards over the seat and yet that instant of arrest had probably saved the girls for as philip fell the orchestra struck up yankee doodle in the liveliest manner the familiar tune caught the ear of the mass which paused in wonder and gave the conductors voice a chance to be heard its a false alarm the tumult was over in a minute and the next laughter was heard and not a few said i knew it wasnt anything what fools people are at such a time the concert was over however a good many people were hurt some of them seriously and among them philip sterling was found bent across the seat insensible with his left arm hanging limp and a bleeding wound on his head when he was carried into the air he revived and said it was nothing a surgeon was called and it was thought best to drive at once to the boltons the surgeon supporting philip who did not speak the whole way his arm was set and his head dressed and the surgeon said he would come round all right in his mind by morning he was very weak alice who was not much frightened while the panic lasted in the hall was very much unnerved by seeing philip so pale and bloody ruth assisted the surgeon with the utmost coolness and with skillful hands helped to dress philips wounds and there was a certain intentness and fierce energy in what she did that might have revealed something to philip if he had been in his senses but he was not or he would not have murmured let alice do it she is not too tall it was ruths first case chapter xxxii washingtons delight in his beautiful sister was measureless he said that she had always been the queenliest creature in the land but that she was only commonplace before compared to what she was now so extraordinary was the improvement wrought by rich fashionable attire but your criticisms are too full of brotherly partiality to be depended on washington other people will judge differently indeed they wont youll see there will never be a woman in washington that can compare with you youll be famous within a fortnight laura everybody will want to know you you wait youll see laura wished in her heart that the prophecy might come true and privately she even believed it might for she had brought all the women whom she had seen since she left home under sharp inspection and the result had not been unsatisfactory to her during a week or two washington drove about the city every day with her and familiarized her with all of its salient features she was beginning to feel very much at home with the town itself and she was also fast acquiring ease with the distinguished people she met at the dilworthy table and losing what little of country timidity she had brought with her from hawkeye she noticed with secret pleasure the little start of admiration that always manifested itself in the faces of the guests when she entered the drawingroom arrayed in evening costume she took comforting note of the fact that these guests directed a very liberal share of their conversation toward her she observed with surprise that famous statesmen and soldiers did not talk like gods as a general thing but said rather commonplace things for the most part and she was filled with gratification to discover that she on the contrary was making a good many shrewd speeches and now and then a really brilliant one and furthermore that they were beginning to be repeated in social circles about the town congress began its sittings and every day or two washington escorted her to the galleries set apart for lady members of the households of senators and representatives here was a larger field and a wider competition but still she saw that many eyes were uplifted toward her face and that first one person and then another called a neighbors attention to her she was not too dull to perceive that the speeches of some of the younger statesmen were delivered about as much and perhaps more at her than to the presiding officer and she was not sorry to see that the dapper young senator from iowa came at once and stood in the open space before the presidents desk to exhibit his feet as soon as she entered the gallery whereas she had early learned from common report that his usual custom was to prop them on his desk and enjoy them himself with a selfish disregard of other peoples longings invitations began to flow in upon her and soon she was fairly in society the season was now in full bloom and the first select reception was at hand that is to say a reception confined to invited guests senator dilworthy had become well convinced by this time that his judgment of the countrybred missouri girl had not deceived him it was plain that she was going to be a peerless missionary in the field of labor he designed her for and therefore it would be perfectly safe and likewise judicious to send her forth well panoplied for her work so he had added new and still richer costumes to her wardrobe and assisted their attractions with costly jewelryloans on the future land sale this first select reception took place at a cabinet ministers or rather a cabinet secretarys mansion when laura and the senator arrived about half past nine or ten in the evening the place was already pretty well crowded and the whitegloved negro servant at the door was still receiving streams of guests the drawingrooms were brilliant with gaslight and as hot as ovens the host and hostess stood just within the door of entrance laura was presented and then she passed on into the maelstrom of bejeweled and richly attired lownecked ladies and whitekidgloved and steel pencoated gentlemen and wherever she moved she was followed by a buzz of admiration that was grateful to all her senses so grateful indeed that her white face was tinged and its beauty heightened by a perceptible suffusion of color she caught such remarks as who is she superb woman that is the new beauty from the west etc etc whenever she halted she was presently surrounded by ministers generals congressmen and all manner of aristocratic people introductions followed and then the usual original question how do you like washington miss hawkins supplemented by that other usual original question is this your first visit these two exciting topics being exhausted conversation generally drifted into calmer channels only to be interrupted at frequent intervals by new introductions and new inquiries as to how laura liked the capital and whether it was her first visit or not and thus for an hour or more the duchess moved through the crush in a rapture of happiness for her doubts were dead and gone now she knew she could conquer here a familiar face appeared in the midst of the multitude and harry brierly fought his difficult way to her side his eyes shouting their gratification so to speak oh this is a happiness tell me my dear miss hawkins sh i know what you are going to ask i do like washington i like it ever so much no but i was going to ask yes i am coming to it coming to it as fast as i can it is my first visit i think you should know that yourself and straightway a wave of the crowd swept her beyond his reach now what can the girl mean of course she likes washington im not such a dummy as to have to ask her that and as to its being her first visit why bang it she knows that i knew it was does she think i have turned idiot curious girl anyway but how they do swarm about her she is the reigning belle of washington after this night shell know five hundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this nights nonsense is over and this isnt even the beginning just as i used to say shell be a card in the matter of yes sir she shall turn the mens heads and ill turn the womens what a team that will be in politics here i wouldnt take a quarter of a million for what i can do in this present session no indeed i wouldnt now here i dont altogether like this that insignificant secretary of legation is why shes smiling on him as if he and now on the admiral now shes illuminating that stuffy congressman from massachusetts vulgar ungrammatcal shovelmaker greasy knave of spades i dont like this sort of thing she doesnt appear to be much distressed about me she hasnt looked this way once all right my bird of paradise if it suits you go on but i think i know your sex ill go to smiling around a little too and see what effect that will have on you and he did smile around a little and got as near to her as he could to watch the effect but the scheme was a failure he could not get her attention she seemed wholly unconscious of him and so he could not flirt with any spirit he could only talk disjointedly he could not keep his eyes on the charmers he talked to he grew irritable jealous and very unhappy he gave up his enterprise leaned his shoulder against a fluted pilaster and pouted while he kept watch upon lauras every movement his other shoulder stole the bloom from many a lovely cheek that brushed him in the surging crush but he noted it not he was too busy cursing himself inwardly for being an egotistical imbecile an hour ago he had thought to take this country lass under his protection and show her life and enjoy her wonder and delight and here she was immersed in the marvel up to her eyes and just a trifle more at home in it than he was himself and now his angry comments ran on again now shes sweetening old brother balaam and he well he is inviting her to the congressional prayermeeting no doubt better let old dilworthy alone to see that she doesnt overlook that and now its splurge of new york and now its batters of new hampshire and now the vice president well i may as well adjourn ive got enough but he hadnt he got as far as the door and then struggled back to take one more look hating himself all the while for his weakness toward midnight when supper was announced the crowd thronged to the supper room where a long table was decked out with what seemed a rare repast but which consisted of things better calculated to feast the eye than the appetite the ladies were soon seated in files along the wall and in groups here and there and the colored waiters filled the plates and glasses and the male guests moved hither and thither conveying them to the privileged sex harry took an ice and stood up by the table with other gentlemen and listened to the buzz of conversation while he ate from these remarks he learned a good deal about laura that was news to him for instance that she was of a distinguished western family that she was highly educated that she was very rich and a great landed heiress that she was not a professor of religion and yet was a christian in the truest and best sense of the word for her whole heart was devoted to the accomplishment of a great and noble enterprise none other than the sacrificing of her landed estates to the uplifting of the downtrodden negro and the turning of his erring feet into the way of light and righteousness harry observed that as soon as one listener had absorbed the story he turned about and delivered it to his next neighbor and the latter individual straightway passed it on and thus he saw it travel the round of the gentlemen and overflow rearward among the ladies he could not trace it backward to its fountain head and so he could not tell who it was that started it one thing annoyed harry a great deal and that was the reflection that he might have been in washington days and days ago and thrown his fascinations about laura with permanent effect while she was new and strange to the capital instead of dawdling in philadelphia to no purpose he feared he had missed a trick as he expressed it he only found one little opportunity of speaking again with laura before the evenings festivities ended and then for the first time in years his airy selfcomplacency failed him his tongues easy confidence forsook it in a great measure and he was conscious of an unheroic timidity he was glad to get away and find a place where he could despise himself in private and try to grow his clipped plumes again when laura reached home she was tired but exultant and senator dilworthy was pleased and satisfied he called laura my daughter next morning and gave her some pin money as he termed it and she sent a hundred and fifty dollars of it to her mother and loaned a trifle to col sellers then the senator had a long private conference with laura and unfolded certain plans of his for the good of the country and religion and the poor and temperance and showed her how she could assist him in developing these worthy and noble enterprises chapter xxxiii laura soon discovered that there were three distinct aristocracies in washington one of these nicknamed the antiques consisted of cultivated highbred old families who looked back with pride upon an ancestry that had been always great in the nations councils and its wars from the birth of the republic downward into this select circle it was difficult to gain admission no was the aristocracy of the middle ground of which more anon no lay beyond of it we will say a word here we will call it the aristocracy of the parvenus as indeed the general public did official position no matter how obtained entitled a man to a place in it and carried his family with him no matter whence they sprang great wealth gave a man a still higher and nobler place in it than did official position if this wealth had been acquired by conspicuous ingenuity with just a pleasant little spice of illegality about it all the better this aristocracy was fast and not averse to ostentation the aristocracy of the antiques ignored the aristocracy of the parvenus the parvenus laughed at the antiques and secretly envied them there were certain important society customs which one in lauras position needed to understand for instance when a lady of any prominence comes to one of our cities and takes up her residence all the ladies of her grade favor her in turn with an initial call giving their cards to the servant at the door by way of introduction they come singly sometimes sometimes in couples and always in elaborate full dress they talk two minutes and a quarter and then go if the lady receiving the call desires a further acquaintance she must return the visit within two weeks to neglect it beyond that time means let the matter drop but if she does return the visit within two weeks it then becomes the other partys privilege to continue the acquaintance or drop it she signifies her willingness to continue it by calling again any time within twelvemonths after that if the parties go on calling upon each other once a year in our large cities that is sufficient and the acquaintanceship holds good the thing goes along smoothly now the annual visits are made and returned with peaceful regularity and bland satisfaction although it is not necessary that the two ladies shall actually see each other oftener than once every few years their cards preserve the intimacy and keep the acquaintanceship intact for instance mrs a pays her annual visit sits in her carriage and sends in her card with the lower right hand corner turned down which signifies that she has called in person mrs b sends down word that she is engaged or wishes to be excused or if she is a parvenu and lowbred she perhaps sends word that she is not at home very good mrs a drives on happy and content if mrs as daughter marries or a child is born to the family mrs b calls sends in her card with the upper left hand corner turned down and then goes along about her affairs for that inverted corner means congratulations if mrs bs husband falls downstairs and breaks his neck mrs a calls leaves her card with the upper right hand corner turned down and then takes her departure this corner means condolence it is very necessary to get the corners right else one may unintentionally condole with a friend on a wedding or congratulate her upon a funeral if either lady is about to leave the city she goes to the others house and leaves her card with p p c engraved under the name which signifies pay parting call but enough of etiquette laura was early instructed in the mysteries of society life by a competent mentor and thus was preserved from troublesome mistakes the first fashionable call she received from a member of the ancient nobility otherwise the antiques was of a pattern with all she received from that limb of the aristocracy afterward this call was paid by mrs majorgeneral fulkefulkerson and daughter they drove up at one in the afternoon in a rather antiquated vehicle with a faded coat of arms on the panels an aged whitewooled negro coachman on the box and a younger darkey beside him the footman both of these servants were dressed in dull brown livery that had seen considerable service the ladies entered the drawingroom in full character that is to say with elizabethan stateliness on the part of the dowager and an easy grace and dignity on the part of the young lady that had a nameless something about it that suggested conscious superiority the dresses of both ladies were exceedingly rich as to material but as notably modest as to color and ornament all parties having seated themselves the dowager delivered herself of a remark that was not unusual in its form and yet it came from her lips with the impressiveness of scripture the weather has been unpropitious of late miss hawkins it has indeed said laura the climate seems to be variable it is its nature of old here said the daughter stating it apparently as a fact only and by her manner waving aside all personal responsibility on account of it is it not so mamma quite so my child do you like winter miss hawkins she said like as if she had an idea that its dictionary meaning was approve of not as well as summer though i think all seasons have their charms it is a very just remark the general held similar views he considered snow in winter proper sultriness in summer legitimate frosts in the autumn the same and rains in spring not objectionable he was not an exacting man and i call to mind now that he always admired thunder you remember child your father always admired thunder he adored it no doubt it reminded him of battle said laura yes i think perhaps it did he had a great respect for nature he often said there was something striking about the ocean you remember his saying that daughter yes often mother i remember it very well and hurricanes he took a great interest in hurricanes and animals dogs especially hunting dogs also comets i think we all have our predilections i think it is this that gives variety to our tastes laura coincided with this view do you find it hard and lonely to be so far from your home and friends miss hawkins i do find it depressing sometimes but then there is so much about me here that is novel and interesting that my days are made up more of sunshine than shadow washington is not a dull city in the season said the young lady we have some very good society indeed and one need not be at a loss for means to pass the time pleasantly are you fond of wateringplaces miss hawkins i have really had no experience of them but i have always felt a strong desire to see something of fashionable wateringplace life we of washington are unfortunately situated in that respect said the dowager it is a tedious distance to newport but there is no help for it laura said to herself long branch and cape may are nearer than newport doubtless these places are low ill feel my way a little and see then she said aloud why i thought that long branch there was no need to feel any further there was that in both faces before her which made that truth apparent the dowager said nobody goes there miss hawkins at least only persons of no position in society and the president she added that with tranquility newport is damp and cold and windy and excessively disagreeable said the daughter but it is very select one cannot be fastidious about minor matters when one has no choice the visit had spun out nearly three minutes now both ladies rose with grave dignity conferred upon laura a formal invitation to call aid then retired from the conference laura remained in the drawingroom and left them to pilot themselves out of the house an inhospitable thing it seemed to her but then she was following her instructions she stood steeped in reverie a while and then she said i think i could always enjoy icebergs as scenery but not as company still she knew these two people by reputation and was aware that they were not icebergs when they were in their own waters and amid their legitimate surroundings but on the contrary were people to be respected for their stainless characters and esteemed for their social virtues and their benevolent impulses she thought it a pity that they had to be such changed and dreary creatures on occasions of state the first call laura received from the other extremity of the washington aristocracy followed close upon the heels of the one we have just been describing the callers this time were the hon mrs oliver higgins the hon mrs patrique oreille pronounced orelay miss bridget pronounced breezhay oreille mrs peter gashly miss gashly and miss emmeline gashly the three carriages arrived at the same moment from different directions they were new and wonderfully shiny and the brasses on the harness were highly polished and bore complicated monograms there were showy coats of arms too with latin mottoes the coachmen and footmen were clad in bright new livery of striking colors and they had black rosettes with shavingbrushes projecting above them on the sides of their stovepipe hats when the visitors swept into the drawingroom they filled the place with a suffocating sweetness procured at the perfumers their costumes as to architecture were the latest fashion intensified they were rainbowhued they were hung with jewels chiefly diamonds it would have been plain to any eye that it had cost something to upholster these women the hon mrs oliver higgins was the wife of a delegate from a distant territory a gentleman who had kept the principal saloon and sold the best whiskey in the principal village in his wilderness and so of course was recognized as the first man of his commonwealth and its fittest representative he was a man of paramount influence at home for he was public spirited he was chief of the fire department he had an admirable command of profane language and had killed several parties his shirt fronts were always immaculate his boots daintily polished and no man could lift a foot and fire a dead shot at a stray speck of dirt on it with a white handkerchief with a finer grace than he his watch chain weighed a pound the gold in his finger ring was worth forty five dollars he wore a diamond clusterpin and he parted his hair behind he had always been regarded as the most elegant gentleman in his territory and it was conceded by all that no man thereabouts was anywhere near his equal in the telling of an obscene story except the venerable whitehaired governor himself the hon higgins had not come to serve his country in washington for nothing the appropriation which he had engineered through congress for the maintenance of the indians in his territory would have made all those savages rich if it had ever got to them the hon mrs higgins was a picturesque woman and a fluent talker and she held a tolerably high station among the parvenus her english was fair enough as a general thing though being of new york origin she had the fashion peculiar to many natives of that city of pronouncing saw and law as if they were spelt sawr and lawr petroleum was the agent that had suddenly transformed the gashlys from modest hardworking country village folk into loud aristocrats and ornaments of the city the hon patrique oreille was a wealthy frenchman from cork not that he was wealthy when he first came from cork but just the reverse when he first landed in new york with his wife he had only halted at castle garden for a few minutes to receive and exhibit papers showing that he had resided in this country two years and then he voted the democratic ticket and went up town to hunt a house he found one and then went to work as assistant to an architect and builder carrying a hod all day and studying politics evenings industry and economy soon enabled him to start a low rum shop in a foul locality and this gave him political influence in our country it is always our first care to see that our people have the opportunity of voting for their choice of men to represent and govern them we do not permit our great officials to appoint the little officials we prefer to have so tremendous a power as that in our own hands we hold it safest to elect our judges and everybody else in our cities the ward meetings elect delegates to the nominating conventions and instruct them whom to nominate the publicans and their retainers rule the ward meetings for every body else hates the worry of politics and stays at home the delegates from the ward meetings organize as a nominating convention and make up a list of candidates one convention offering a democratic and another a republican list of incorruptibles and then the great meek public come forward at the proper time and make unhampered choice and bless heaven that they live in a free land where no form of despotism can ever intrude patrick oriley as his name then stood created friends and influence very fast for he was always on hand at the police courts to give straw bail for his customers or establish an alibi for them in case they had been beating anybody to death on his premises consequently he presently became a political leader and was elected to a petty office under the city government out of a meager salary he soon saved money enough to open quite a stylish liquor saloon higher up town with a faro bank attached and plenty of capital to conduct it with this gave him fame and great respectability the position of alderman was forced upon him and it was just the same as presenting him a gold mine he had fine horses and carriages now and closed up his whiskey mill by and by he became a large contractor for city work and was a bosom friend of the great and good wm m weed himself who had stolen from the city and was a man so envied so honored so adored indeed that when the sheriff went to his office to arrest him as a felon that sheriff blushed and apologized and one of the illustrated papers made a picture of the scene and spoke of the matter in such a way as to show that the editor regretted that the offense of an arrest had been offered to so exalted a personage as mr weed mr oriley furnished shingle nails to the new court house at three thousand dollars a keg and eighteen gross of cent thermometers at fifteen hundred dollars a dozen the controller and the board of audit passed the bills and a mayor who was simply ignorant but not criminal signed them when they were paid mr orileys admirers gave him a solitaire diamond pin of the size of a filbert in imitation of the liberality of mr weeds friends and then mr oriley retired from active service and amused himself with buying real estate at enormous figures and holding it in other peoples names by and by the newspapers came out with exposures and called weed and oriley thieves whereupon the people rose as one man voting repeatedly and elected the two gentlemen to their proper theatre of action the new york legislature the newspapers clamored and the courts proceeded to try the new legislators for their small irregularities our admirable jury system enabled the persecuted exofficials to secure a jury of nine gentlemen from a neighboring asylum and three graduates from singsing and presently they walked forth with characters vindicated the legislature was called upon to spew them forth a thing which the legislature declined to do it was like asking children to repudiate their own father it was a legislature of the modern pattern being now wealthy and distinguished mr oriley still bearing the legislative hon attached to his name for titles never die in america although we do take a republican pride in poking fun at such trifles sailed for europe with his family they traveled all about turning their noses up at every thing and not finding it a difficult thing to do either because nature had originally given those features a cast in that direction and finally they established themselves in paris that paradise of americans of their sort they staid there two years and learned to speak english with a foreign accent not that it hadnt always had a foreign accent which was indeed the case but now the nature of it was changed finally they returned home and became ultra fashionables they landed here as the hon patrique oreille and family and so are known unto this day laura provided seats for her visitors and they immediately launched forth into a breezy sparkling conversation with that easy confidence which is to be found only among persons accustomed to high life ive been intending to call sooner miss hawkins said the hon mrs oreille but the weathers been so horrid how do you like washington laura liked it very well indeed mrs gashly is it your first visit yea it was her first all indeed mrs oreille im afraid youll despise the weather miss hawkins its perfectly awful it always is i tell mr oreille i cant and i wont put up with any such a climate if we were obliged to do it i wouldnt mind it but we are not obliged to and so i dont see the use of it sometimes its real pitiful the way the childern pine for parry dont look so sad bridget ma chere poor child she cant hear parry mentioned without getting the blues mrs gashly well i should think so mrs oreille a body lives in paris but a body only stays here i dote on paris id druther scrimp along on ten thousand dollars a year there than suffer and worry here on a real decent income miss gashly well then i wish youd take us back mother im sure i hate this stoopid country enough even if it is our dear native land miss emmeline gashly what and leave poor johnny peterson behind an airy genial laugh applauded this sally miss gashly sister i should think youd be ashamed of yourself miss emmeline oh you neednt ruffle your feathers so i was only joking he dont mean anything by coming to the house every evening only comes to see mother of course thats all general laughter miss g prettily confused emmeline how can you mrs g let your sister alone emmeline i never saw such a tease mrs oreille what lovely corals you have miss hawkins just look at them bridget dear ive a great passion for corals its a pity theyre getting a little common i have some elegant ones not as elegant as yours though but of course i dont wear them now laura i suppose they are rather common but still i have a great affection for these because they were given to me by a dear old friend of our family named murphy he was a very charming man but very eccentric we always supposed he was an irishman but after be got rich he went abroad for a year or two and when he came back you would have been amused to see how interested he was in a potato he asked what it was now you know that when providence shapes a mouth especially for the accommodation of a potato you can detect that fact at a glance when that mouth is in repose foreign travel can never remove that sign but he was a very delightful gentleman and his little foible did not hurt him at all we all have our shams i suppose there is a sham somewhere about every individual if we could manage to ferret it out i would so like to go to france i suppose our society here compares very favorably with french society does it not mrs oreille mrs o not by any means miss hawkins french society is much more elegant much more so laura i am sorry to hear that i suppose ours has deteriorated of late mrs o very much indeed there are people in society here that have really no more money to live on than what some of us pay for servant hire still i wont say but what some of them are very good people and respectable too laura the old families seem to be holding themselves aloof from what i hear i suppose you seldom meet in society now the people you used to be familiar with twelve or fifteen years ago mrs o oh nohardly ever mr oriley kept his first rummill and protected his customers from the law in those days and this turn of the conversation was rather uncomfortable to madame than otherwise hon mrs higgins is francois health good now mrs oreille mrs o thankful for the intervention not very a body couldnt expect it he was always delicate especially his lungs and this odious climate tells on him strong now after parry which is so mild mrs h i should think so husband says percyll die if he dont have a change and so im going to swap round a little and see what can be done i saw a lady from florida last week and she recommended key west i told her percy couldnt abide winds as he was threatened with a pulmonary affection and then she said try st augustine its an awful distance ten or twelve hundred mile they say but then in a case of this kind a body cant stand back for trouble you know mrs o no of course thats off if francois dont get better soon weve got to look out for some other place or else europe weve thought some of the hot springs but i dont know its a great responsibility and a body wants to go cautious is hildebrand about again mrs gashly mrs g yes but thats about all it was indigestion you know and it looks as if it was chronic and you know i do dread dyspepsia weve all been worried a good deal about him the doctor recommended baked apple and spoiled meat and i think it done him good its about the only thing that will stay on his stomach nowadays we have dr shovel now whos your doctor mrs higgins mrs h well we had dr spooner a good while but he runs so much to emetics which i think are weakening that we changed off and took dr leathers we like him very much he has a fine european reputation too the first thing he suggested for percy was to have him taken out in the back yard for an airing every afternoon with nothing at all on mrs o and mrs g what mrs h as true as im sitting here and it actually helped him for two or three days it did indeed but after that the doctor said it seemed to be too severe and so he has fell back on hot footbaths at night and cold showers in the morning but i dont think there can be any good sound help for him in such a climate as this i believe we are going to lose him if we dont make a change mrs o i suppose you heard of the fright we had two weeks ago last saturday no why that is strange but come to remember youve all been away to richmond francois tumbled from the sky light in the secondstory hall clean down to the first floor everybody mercy mrs o yes indeed and broke two of his ribs everybody what mrs o just as true as you live first we thought he must be injured internally it was fifteen minutes past in the evening of course we were all distracted in a moment everybody was flying everywhere and nobody doing anything worth anything by and by i flung out next door and dragged in dr sprague president of the medical university no time to go for our own doctor of course and the minute he saw francois he said send for your own physician madam said it as cross as a bear too and turned right on his heel and cleared out without doing a thing everybody the mean contemptible brute mrs o well you may say it i was nearly out of my wits by this time but we hurried off the servants after our own doctor and telegraphed mother she was in new york and rushed down on the first train and when the doctor got there lo and behold you he found francois had broke one of his legs too everybody goodness mrs o yes so he set his leg and bandaged it up and fixed his ribs and gave him a dose of something to quiet down his excitement and put him to sleep poor thing he was trembling and frightened to death and it was pitiful to see him we had him in my bed mr oreille slept in the guest room and i laid down beside francois but not to sleep bless you no bridget and i set up all night and the doctor staid till two in the morning bless his old heart when mother got there she was so used up with anxiety that she had to go to bed and have the doctor but when she found that francois was not in immediate danger she rallied and by night she was able to take a watch herself well for three days and nights we three never left that bedside only to take an hours nap at a time and then the doctor said francois was out of danger and if ever there was a thankful set in this world it was us lauras respect for these women had augmented during this conversation naturally enough affection and devotion are qualities that are able to adorn and render beautiful a character that is otherwise unattractive and even repulsive mrs gashly i do believe i would a died if i had been in your place mrs oreille the time hildebrand was so low with the pneumonia emmeline and me were all alone with him most of the time and we never took a minutes sleep for as much as two days and nights it was at newport and we wouldnt trust hired nurses one afternoon he had a fit and jumped up and run out on the portico of the hotel with nothing in the world on and the wind a blowing liken ice and we after him scared to death and when the ladies and gentlemen saw that he had a fit every lady scattered for her room and not a gentleman lifted his hand to help the wretches well after that his life hung by a thread for as much as ten days and the minute he was out of danger emmeline and me just went to bed sick and worn out i never want to pass through such a time again poor dear francois which leg did he break mrs oreille mrs o it was his right hand hind leg jump down francois dear and show the ladies what a cruel limp youve got yet francois demurred but being coaxed and delivered gently upon the floor he performed very satisfactorily with his right hand hind leg in the air all were affected even laura but hers was an affection of the stomach the countrybred girl had not suspected that the little whining tenounce black and tan reptile clad in a red embroidered pigmy blanket and reposing in mrs oreilles lap all through the visit was the individual whose sufferings had been stirring the dormant generosities of her nature she said poor little creature you might have lost him mrs o o pray dont mention it miss hawkins it gives me such a turn laura and hildebrand and percy are theyare they like this one mrs g no hilly has considerable skye blood in him i believe mrs h percys the same only he is two months and ten days older and has his ears cropped his father martin farquhar tupper was sickly and died young but he was the sweetest disposition his mother had heart disease but was very gentle and resigned and a wonderful ratter as impossible and exasperating as this conversation may sound to a person who is not an idiot it is scarcely in any respect an exaggeration of one which one of us actually listened to in an american drawing room otherwise we could not venture to put such a chapter into a book which professes to deal with social possibilities the authors so carried away had the visitors become by their interest attaching to this discussion of family matters that their stay had been prolonged to a very improper and unfashionable length but they suddenly recollected themselves now and took their departure lauras scorn was boundless the more she thought of these people and their extraordinary talk the more offensive they seemed to her and yet she confessed that if one must choose between the two extreme aristocracies it might be best on the whole looking at things from a strictly business point of view to herd with the parvenus she was in washington solely to compass a certain matter and to do it at any cost and these people might be useful to her while it was plain that her purposes and her schemes for pushing them would not find favor in the eyes of the antiques if it came to choice and it might come to that sooner or later she believed she could come to a decision without much difficulty or many pangs but the best aristocracy of the three washington castes and really the most powerful by far was that of the middle ground it was made up of the families of public men from nearly every state in the union men who held positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the government and whose characters had been for years blemishless both at home and at the capital these gentlemen and their households were unostentatious people they were educated and refined they troubled themselves but little about the two other orders of nobility but moved serenely in their wide orbit confident in their own strength and well aware of the potency of their influence they had no troublesome appearances to keep up no rivalries which they cared to distress themselves about no jealousies to fret over they could afford to mind their own affairs and leave other combinations to do the same or do otherwise just as they chose they were people who were beyond reproach and that was sufficient senator dilworthy never came into collision with any of these factions he labored for them all and with them all he said that all men were brethren and all were entitled to the honest unselfish help and countenance of a christian laborer in the public vineyard laura concluded after reflection to let circumstances determine the course it might be best for her to pursue as regarded the several aristocracies now it might occur to the reader that perhaps laura had been somewhat rudely suggestive in her remarks to mrs oreille when the subject of corals was under discussion but it did not occur to laura herself she was not a person of exaggerated refinement indeed the society and the influences that had formed her character had not been of a nature calculated to make her so she thought that give and take was fair play and that to parry an offensive thrust with a sarcasm was a neat and legitimate thing to do she some times talked to people in a way which some ladies would consider actually shocking but laura rather prided herself upon some of her exploits of that character we are sorry we cannot make her a faultless heroine but we cannot for the reason that she was human she considered herself a superior conversationist long ago when the possibility had first been brought before her mind that some day she might move in washington society she had recognized the fact that practiced conversational powers would be a necessary weapon in that field she had also recognized the fact that since her dealings there must be mainly with men and men whom she supposed to be exceptionally cultivated and able she would need heavier shot in her magazine than mere brilliant society nothings whereupon she had at once entered upon a tireless and elaborate course of reading and had never since ceased to devote every unoccupied moment to this sort of preparation having now acquired a happy smattering of various information she used it with good effect she passed for a singularly well informed woman in washington the quality of her literary tastes had necessarily undergone constant improvement under this regimen and as necessarily also the duality of her language had improved though it cannot be denied that now and then her former condition of life betrayed itself in just perceptible inelegancies of expression and lapses of grammar chapter xxxiv when laura had been in washington three months she was still the same person in one respect that she was when she first arrived there that is to say she still bore the name of laura hawkins otherwise she was perceptibly changed she had arrived in a state of grievous uncertainty as to what manner of woman she was physically and intellectually as compared with eastern women she was well satisfied now that her beauty was confessed her mind a grade above the average and her powers of fascination rather extraordinary so she was at ease upon those points when she arrived she was possessed of habits of economy and not possessed of money now she dressed elaborately gave but little thought to the cost of things and was very well fortified financially she kept her mother and washington freely supplied with money and did the same by col sellers who always insisted upon giving his note for loans with interest he was rigid upon that she must take interest and one of the colonels greatest satisfactions was to go over his accounts and note what a handsome sum this accruing interest amounted to and what a comfortable though modest support it would yield laura in case reverses should overtake her in truth he could not help feeling that he was an efficient shield for her against poverty and so if her expensive ways ever troubled him for a brief moment he presently dismissed the thought and said to himself let her go on even if she loses everything she is still safe this interest will always afford her a good easy income laura was on excellent terms with a great many members of congress and there was an undercurrent of suspicion in some quarters that she was one of that detested class known as lobbyists but what belle could escape slander in such a city fairminded people declined to condemn her on mere suspicion and so the injurious talk made no very damaging headway she was very gay now and very celebrated and she might well expect to be assailed by many kinds of gossip she was growing used to celebrity and could already sit calm and seemingly unconscious under the fire of fifty lorgnettes in a theatre or even overhear the low voice thats she as she passed along the street without betraying annoyance the whole air was full of a vague vast scheme which was to eventuate in filling lauras pockets with millions of money some had one idea of the scheme and some another but nobody had any exact knowledge upon the subject all that any one felt sure about was that lauras landed estates were princely in value and extent and that the government was anxious to get hold of them for public purposes and that laura was willing to make the sale but not at all anxious about the matter and not at all in a hurry it was whispered that senator dilworthy was a stumbling block in the way of an immediate sale because he was resolved that the government should not have the lands except with the understanding that they should be devoted to the uplifting of the negro race laura did not care what they were devoted to it was said a world of very different gossip to the contrary notwithstanding but there were several other heirs and they would be guided entirely by the senators wishes and finally many people averred that while it would be easy to sell the lands to the government for the benefit of the negro by resorting to the usual methods of influencing votes senator dilworthy was unwilling to have so noble a charity sullied by any taint of corruption he was resolved that not a vote should be bought nobody could get anything definite from laura about these matters and so gossip had to feed itself chiefly upon guesses but the effect of it all was that laura was considered to be very wealthy and likely to be vastly more so in a little while consequently she was much courted and as much envied her wealth attracted many suitors perhaps they came to worship her riches but they remained to worship her some of the noblest men of the time succumbed to her fascinations she frowned upon no lover when he made his first advances but by and by when she was hopelessly enthralled he learned from her own lips that she had formed a resolution never to marry then he would go away hating and cursing the whole sex and she would calmly add his scalp to her string while she mused upon the bitter day that col selby trampled her love and her pride in the dust in time it came to be said that her way was paved with broken hearts poor washington gradually woke up to the fact that he too was an intellectual marvel as well as his gifted sister he could not conceive how it had come about it did not occur to him that the gossip about his familys great wealth had any thing to do with it he could not account for it by any process of reasoning and was simply obliged to accept the fact and give up trying to solve the riddle he found himself dragged into society and courted wondered at and envied very much as if he were one of those foreign barbers who flit over here now and then with a selfconferred title of nobility and marry some rich fools absurd daughter sometimes at a dinner party or a reception he would find himself the centre of interest and feel unutterably uncomfortable in the discovery being obliged to say something he would mine his brain and put in a blast and when the smoke and flying debris had cleared away the result would be what seemed to him but a poor little intellectual clod of dirt or two and then he would be astonished to see everybody as lost in admiration as if he had brought up a ton or two of virgin gold every remark he made delighted his hearers and compelled their applause he overheard people say he was exceedingly bright they were chiefly mammas and marriageable young ladies he found that some of his good things were being repeated about the town whenever he heard of an instance of this kind he would keep that particular remark in mind and analyze it at home in private at first he could not see that the remark was anything better than a parrot might originate but by and by he began to feel that perhaps he underrated his powers and after that he used to analyze his good things with a deal of comfort and find in them a brilliancy which would have been unapparent to him in earlier days and then he would make a note of that good thing and say it again the first time he found himself in a new company presently he had saved up quite a repertoire of brilliancies and after that he confined himself to repeating these and ceased to originate any more lest he might injure his reputation by an unlucky effort he was constantly having young ladies thrust upon his notice at receptions or left upon his hands at parties and in time he began to feel that he was being deliberately persecuted in this way and after that he could not enjoy society because of his constant dread of these female ambushes and surprises he was distressed to find that nearly every time he showed a young lady a polite attention he was straightway reported to be engaged to her and as some of these reports got into the newspapers occasionally he had to keep writing to louise that they were lies and she must believe in him and not mind them or allow them to grieve her washington was as much in the dark as anybody with regard to the great wealth that was hovering in the air and seemingly on the point of tumbling into the family pocket laura would give him no satisfaction all she would say was wait be patient you will see but will it be soon laura it will not be very long i think but what makes you think so i have reasons and good ones just wait and be patient but is it going to be as much as people say it is what do they say it is oh ever so much millions yes it will be a great sum but how great laura will it be millions yes you may call it that yes it will be millions there now does that satisfy you splendid i can wait i can wait patiently ever so patiently once i was near selling the land for twenty thousand dollars once for thirty thousand dollars once after that for seven thousand dollars and once for forty thousand dollars but something always told me not to do it what a fool i would have been to sell it for such a beggarly trifle it is the land thats to bring the money isnt it laura you can tell me that much cant you yes i dont mind saying that much it is the land but mind dont ever hint that you got it from me dont mention me in the matter at all washington all right i wont millions isnt it splendid i mean to look around for a building lot a lot with fine ornamental shrubbery and all that sort of thing i will do it today and i might as well see an architect too and get him to go to work at a plan for a house i dont intend to spare and expense i mean to have the noblest house that money can build then after a pause he did not notice lauras smiles laura would you lay the main hall in encaustic tiles or just in fancy patterns of hard wood laura laughed a good oldfashioned laugh that had more of her former natural self about it than any sound that had issued from her mouth in many weeks she said you dont change washington you still begin to squander a fortune right and left the instant you hear of it in the distance you never wait till the foremost dollar of it arrives within a hundred miles of you and she kissed her brother good bye and left him weltering in his dreams so to speak he got up and walked the floor feverishly during two hours and when he sat down he had married louise built a house reared a family married them off spent upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars on mere luxuries and died worth twelve millions chapter xxxv laura went down stairs knocked atthe study door and entered scarcely waiting for the response senator dilworthy was alone with an open bible in his hand upside down laura smiled and said forgetting her acquired correctness of speech it is only me ah come in sit down and the senator closed the book and laid it down i wanted to see you time to report progress from the committee of the whole and the senator beamed with his own congressional wit in the committee of the whole things are working very well we have made ever so much progress in a week i believe that you and i together could run this government beautifully uncle the senator beamed again he liked to be called uncle by this beautiful woman did you see hopperson last night after the congressional prayer meeting yes he came hes a kind of eh he is one of my friends laura hes a fine man a very fine man i dont know any man in congress id sooner go to for help in any christian work what did he say oh he beat around a little he said he should like to help the negro his heart went out to the negro and all that plenty of them say that but he was a little afraid of the tennessee land bill if senator dilworthy wasnt in it he should suspect there was a fraud on the government he said that did he yes and he said he felt he couldnt vote for it he was shy not shy child cautious hes a very cautious man i have been with him a great deal on conference committees he wants reasons good ones didnt you show him he was in error about the bill i did i went over the whole thing i had to tell him some of the side arrangements some of the you didnt mention me oh no i told him you were daft about the negro and the philanthropy part of it as you are daft is a little strong laura but you know that i wouldnt touch this bill if it were not for the public good and for the good of the colored race much as i am interested in the heirs of this property and would like to have them succeed laura looked a little incredulous and the senator proceeded dont misunderstand me i dont deny that it is for the interest of all of us that this bill should go through and it will i have no concealments from you but i have one principle in my public life which i should like you to keep in mind it has always been my guide i never push a private interest if it is not justified and ennobled by some larger public good i doubt christian would be justified in working for his own salvation if it was not to aid in the salvation of his fellow men the senator spoke with feeling and then added i hope you showed hopperson that our motives were pure yes and he seemed to have a new light on the measure i think will vote for it i hope so his name will give tone and strength to it i knew you would only have to show him that it was just and pure in order to secure his cordial support i think i convinced him yes i am perfectly sure he will vote right now thats good thats good said the senator smiling and rubbing his hands is there anything more youll find some changes in that i guess handing the senator a printed list of names those checked off are all right ah m m running his eye down the list thats encouraging what is the c before some of the names and the b b those are my private marks that c stands for convinced with argument the b b is a general sign for a relative you see it stands before three of the hon committee i expect to see the chairman of the committee today mr buckstone so you must he ought to be seen without any delay buckstone is a worldly sort of a fellow but he has charitable impulses if we secure him we shall have a favorable report by the committee and it will be a great thing to be able to state that fact quietly where it will do good oh i saw senator balloon he will help us i suppose balloon is a wholehearted fellow i cant help loving that man for all his drollery and waggishness he puts on an air of levity sometimes but there aint a man in the senate knows the scriptures as he does he did not make any objections not exactly he said shall i tell you what he said asked laura glancing furtively at him certainly he said he had no doubt it was a good thing if senator dilworthy was in it it would pay to look into it the senator laughed but rather feebly and said balloon is always full of his jokes i explained it to him he said it was all right he only wanted a word with you continued laura he is a handsome old gentleman and he is gallant for an old man my daughter said the senator with a grave look i trust there was nothing free in his manner free repeated laura with indignation in her face with me there there child i meant nothing balloon talks a little freely sometimes with men but he is right at heart his term expires next year and i fear we shall lose him he seemed to be packing the day i was there his rooms were full of dry goods boxes into which his servant was crowding all manner of old clothes and stuff i suppose he will paint pub docs on them and frank them home thats good economy isnt it yes yes but child all congressmen do that it may not be strictly honest indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in with the clothes its a funny world goodbye uncle im going to see that chairman and humming a cheery opera air she departed to her room to dress for going out before she did that however she took out her note book and was soon deep in its contents marking dashing erasing figuring and talking to herself free i wonder what dilworthy does think of me anyway one two eight seventeen twentyone mm it takes a heap for a majority wouldnt dilworthy open his eyes if he knew some of the things balloon did say to me there hoppersons influence ought to count twenty the sanctimonious old curmudgeon soninlaw sinecure in the negro institution that about gauges him the three committeemen sonsinlaw nothing like a soninlaw here in washington or a brotherinlaw and everybody has em lets see sixtyone with places twentyfive persuaded it is getting on well have twothirds of congress in time dilworthy must surely know i understand him uncle dilworthy uncle balloon tells very amusing stories when ladies are not present i should think so m m eightyfive there i must find that chairman queer buckstone acts seemed to be in love i was sure of it he promised to come here and he hasnt strange very strange i must chance to meet him today laura dressed and went out thinking she was perhaps too early for mr buckstone to come from the house but as he lodged near the bookstore she would drop in there and keep a look out for him while laura is on her errand to find mr buckstone it may not be out of the way to remark that she knew quite as much of washington life as senator dilworthy gave her credit for and more than she thought proper to tell him she was acquainted by this time with a good many of the young fellows of newspaper row and exchanged gossip with them to their mutual advantage they were always talking in the row everlastingly gossiping bantering and sarcastically praising things and going on in a style which was a curious commingling of earnest and persiflage col sellers liked this talk amazingly though he was sometimes a little at sea in it and perhaps that didnt lessen the relish of the conversation to the correspondents it seems that they had got hold of the drygoods box packing story about balloon one day and were talking it over when the colonel came in the colonel wanted to know all about it and hicks told him and then hicks went on with a serious air colonel if you register a letter it means that it is of value doesnt it and if you pay fifteen cents for registering it the government will have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its full value if it is lost isnt that so yes i suppose its so well senator balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those seven huge boxes of old clothes and shipped that ton of secondhand rubbish old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as registered matter it was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch of humor about it too i think there is more real talent among our public men of today than there was among those of old times a far more fertile fancy a much happier ingenuity now colonel can you picture jefferson or washington or john adams franking their wardrobes through the mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government responsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents statesmen were dull creatures in those days i have a much greater admiration for senator balloon yes balloon is a man of parts there is no denying it i think so he is spoken of for the post of minister to china or austria and i hope will be appointed what we want abroad is good examples of the national character john jay and benjamin franklin were well enough in their day but the nation has made progress since then balloon is a man we know and can depend on to be true to himself yes and balloon has had a good deal of public experience he is an old friend of mine he was governor of one of the territories a while and was very satisfactory indeed he was he was exofficio indian agent too many a man would have taken the indian appropriation and devoted the money to feeding and clothing the helpless savages whose land had been taken from them by the white man in the interests of civilization but balloon knew their needs better he built a government sawmill on the reservation with the money and the lumber sold for enormous prices a relative of his did all the work free of charge that is to say he charged nothing more than the lumber world bring but the poor injuns not that i care much for injuns what did he do for them gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with governor balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor indians but balloon is not alone we have many truly noble statesmen in our countrys service like balloon the senate is full of them dont you think so colonel well i dunno i honor my countrys public servants as much as any one can i meet them sir every day and the more i see of them the more i esteem them and the more grateful i am that our institutions give us the opportunity of securing their services few lands are so blest that is true colonel to be sure you can buy now and then a senator or a representative but they do not know it is wrong and so they are not ashamed of it they are gentle and confiding and childlike and in my opinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount of sinful sagacity could i quite agree with you col sellers well hesitated the colonel i am afraid some of them do buy their seats yes i am afraid they do but as senator dilworthy himself said to me it is sinful it is very wrong it is shameful heaven protect me from such a charge that is what dilworthy said and yet when you come to look at it you cannot deny that we would have to go without the services of some of our ablest men sir if the country were opposed to to bribery it is a harsh term i do not like to use it the colonel interrupted himself at this point to meet an engagement with the austrian minister and took his leave with his usual courtly bow chapter xxxvi in due time laura alighted at the book store and began to look at the titles of the handsome array of books on the counter a dapper clerk of perhaps nineteen or twenty years with hair accurately parted and surprisingly slick came bustling up and leaned over with a pretty smile and an affable can i was there any particular book you wished to see have you taines england beg pardon taines notes on england the young gentleman scratched the side of his nose with a cedar pencil which he took down from its bracket on the side of his head and reflected a moment ah i see with a bright smile train you mean not taine george francis train no mam we i mean taine if i may take the liberty the clerk reflected again then taine taine is it hymns no it isnt hymns it is a volume that is making a deal of talk just now and is very widely known except among parties who sell it the clerk glanced at her face to see if a sarcasm might not lurk somewhere in that obscure speech but the gentle simplicity of the beautiful eyes that met his banished that suspicion he went away and conferred with the proprietor both appeared to be nonplussed they thought and talked and talked and thought by turns then both came forward and the proprietor said is it an american book mam no it is an american reprint of an english translation oh yes yes i remember now we are expecting it every day it isnt out yet i think you must be mistaken because you advertised it a week ago why no can that be so yes i am sure of it and besides here is the book itself on the counter she bought it and the proprietor retired from the field then she asked the clerk for the autocrat of the breakfast table and was pained to see the admiration her beauty had inspired in him fade out of his face he said with cold dignity that cook books were somewhat out of their line but he would order it if she desired it she said no never mind then she fell to conning the titles again finding a delight in the inspection of the hawthornes the longfellows the tennysons and other favorites of her idle hours meantime the clerks eyes were busy and no doubt his admiration was returning again or may be he was only gauging her probable literary tastes by some sagacious system of admeasurement only known to his guild now he began to assist her in making a selection but his efforts met with no success indeed they only annoyed her and unpleasantly interrupted her meditations presently while she was holding a copy of venetian life in her hand and running over a familiar passage here and there the clerk said briskly snatching up a papercovered volume and striking the counter a smart blow with it to dislodge the dust now here is a work that weve sold a lot of everybody thats read it likes it and he intruded it under her nose its a book that i can recommend the pirates doom or the last of the buccaneers i think its one of the best things thats come out this season laura pushed it gently aside her hand and went on and went on filching from venetian life i believe i do not want it she said the clerk hunted around awhile glancing at one title and then another but apparently not finding what he wanted however he succeeded at last said he have you ever read this mam i am sure youll like it its by the author of the hooligans of hackensack it is full of love troubles and mysteries and all sorts of such things the heroine strangles her own mother just glance at the title please gonderil the vampire or the dance of death and here is the jokists own treasury or the phunny phellows bosom phriend the funniest thing ive read it four times mam and i can laugh at the very sight of it yet and gonderil i assure you it is the most splendid book i ever read i know you will like these books mam because ive read them myself and i know what they are oh i was perplexed but i see how it is now you must have thought i asked you to tell me what sort of books i wanted for i am apt to say things which i dont really mean when i am absent minded i suppose i did ask you didnt i no mam but i yes i must have done it else you would not have offered your services for fear it might be rude but dont be troubled it was all my fault i ought not to have been so heedless i ought not to have asked you but you didnt ask me mam we always help customers all we can you see our experience living right among books all the time that sort of thing makes us able to help a customer make a selection you know now does it indeed it is part of your business then yesm we always help how good it is of you some people would think it rather obtrusive perhaps but i dont i think it is real kindness even charity some people jump to conclusions without any thought you have noticed that o yes said the clerk a little perplexed as to whether to feel comfortable or the reverse oh yes indeed ive often noticed that mam yes they jump to conclusions with an absurd heedlessness now some people would think it odd that because you with the budding tastes and the innocent enthusiasms natural to your time of life enjoyed the vampires and the volume of nursery jokes you should imagine that an older person would delight in them too but i do not think it odd at all i think it natural perfectly natural in you and kind too you look like a person who not only finds a deep pleasure in any little thing in the way of literature that strikes you forcibly but is willing and glad to share that pleasure with others and that i think is noble and admirable very noble and admirable i think we ought all to share our pleasures with others and do what we can to make each other happy do not you oh yes oh yes indeed yes you are quite right mam but he was getting unmistakably uncomfortable now notwithstanding lauras confiding sociability and almost affectionate tone yes indeed many people would think that what a bookseller or perhaps his clerk knows about literature as literature in contradistinction to its character as merchandise would hardly be of much assistance to a person that is to an adult of course in the selection of food for the mind except of course wrapping paper or twine or wafers or something like that but i never feel that way i feel that whatever service you offer me you offer with a good heart and i am as grateful for it as if it were the greatest boon to me and it is useful to me it is bound to be so it cannot be otherwise if you show me a book which you have read not skimmed over or merely glanced at but read and you tell me that you enjoyed it and that you could read it three or four times then i know what book i want thank you th to avoid yes indeed i think that no information ever comes amiss in this world once or twice i have traveled in the cars and there you know the peanut boy always measures you with his eye and hands you out a book of murders if you are fond of theology or tupper or a dictionary or t s arthur if you are fond of poetry or he hands you a volume of distressing jokes or a copy of the american miscellany if you particularly dislike that sort of literary fatty degeneration of the heart just for the world like a pleasant spoken wellmeaning gentleman in any bookstore but here i am running on as if business men had nothing to do but listen to women talk you must pardon me for i was not thinking and you must let me thank you again for helping me i read a good deal and shall be in nearly every day and i would be sorry to have you think me a customer who talks too much and buys too little might i ask you to give me the time ahtwotwentytwo thank you very much i will set mine while i have the opportunity but she could not get her watch open apparently she tried and tried again then the clerk trembling at his own audacity begged to be allowed to assist she allowed him he succeeded and was radiant under the sweet influences of her pleased face and her seductively worded acknowledgements with gratification then he gave her the exact time again and anxiously watched her turn the hands slowly till they reached the precise spot without accident or loss of life and then he looked as happy as a man who had helped a fellow being through a momentous undertaking and was grateful to know that he had not lived in vain laura thanked him once more the words were music to his ear but what were they compared to the ravishing smile with which she flooded his whole system when she bowed her adieu and turned away he was no longer suffering torture in the pillory where she had had him trussed up during so many distressing moments but he belonged to the list of her conquests and was a flattered and happy thrall with the dawnlight of love breaking over the eastern elevations of his heart it was about the hour now for the chairman of the house committee on benevolent appropriations to make his appearance and laura stepped to the door to reconnoiter she glanced up the street and sure enough chapter xxxvii that chairman was nowhere in sight such disappointments seldom occur in novels but are always happening in real life she was obliged to make a new plan she sent him a note and asked him to call in the evening which he did she received the hon mr buckstone with a sunny smile and said i dont know how i ever dared to send you a note mr buckstone for you have the reputation of not being very partial to our sex why i am sure my reputation does me wrong then miss hawkins i have been married once is that nothing in my favor oh yes that is it may be and it may not be if you have known what perfection is in woman it is fair to argue that inferiority cannot interest you now even if that were the case it could not affect you miss hawkins said the chairman gallantly fame does not place you in the list of ladies who rank below perfection this happy speech delighted mr buckstone as much as it seemed to delight laura but it did not confuse him as much as it apparently did her i wish in all sincerity that i could be worthy of such a felicitous compliment as that but i am a woman and so i am gratified for it just as it is and would not have it altered but it is not merely a compliment that is an empty complement it is the truth all men will endorse that laura looked pleased and said it is very kind of you to say it it is a distinction indeed for a countrybred girl like me to be so spoken of by people of brains and culture you are so kind that i know you will pardon my putting you to the trouble to come this evening indeed it was no trouble it was a pleasure i am alone in the world since i lost my wife and i often long for the society of your sex miss hawkins notwithstanding what people may say to the contrary it is pleasant to hear you say that i am sure it must be so if i feel lonely at times because of my exile from old friends although surrounded by new ones who are already very dear to me how much more lonely must you feel bereft as you are and with no wholesome relief from the cares of state that weigh you down for your own sake as well as for the sake of others you ought to go into society oftener i seldom see you at a reception and when i do you do not usually give me very much of your attention i never imagined that you wished it or i would have been very glad to make myself happy in that way but one seldom gets an opportunity to say more than a sentence to you in a place like that you are always the centre of a group a fact which you may have noticed yourself but if one might come here indeed you would always find a hearty welcome mr buckstone i have often wished you would come and tell me more about cairo and the pyramids as you once promised me you would why do you remember that yet miss hawkins i thought ladies memories were more fickle than that oh they are not so fickle as gentlemens promises and besides if i had been inclined to forget i did you not give me something by way of a remembrancer did i think it does seem to me that i did but i have forgotten what it was now never never call a ladys memory fickle again do you recognize this a little spray of box i am beaten i surrender but have you kept that all this time lauras confusion was very pretty she tried to hide it but the more she tried the more manifest it became and withal the more captivating to look upon presently she threw the spray of box from her with an annoyed air and said i forgot myself i have been very foolish i beg that you will forget this absurd thing mr buckstone picked up the spray and sitting down by lauras side on the sofa said please let me keep it miss hawkins i set a very high value upon it now give it to me mr buckstone and do not speak so i have been sufficiently punished for my thoughtlessness you cannot take pleasure in adding to my distress please give it to me indeed i do not wish to distress you but do not consider the matter so gravely you have done yourself no wrong you probably forgot that you had it but if you had given it to me i would have kept it and not forgotten it do not talk so mr buckstone give it to me please and forget the matter it would not be kind to refuse since it troubles you so and so i restore it but if you would give me part of it and keep the rest so that you might have something to remind you of me when you wished to laugh at my foolishness oh by no means no simply that i might remember that i had once assisted to discomfort you and be reminded to do so no more laura looked up and scanned his face a moment she was about to break the twig but she hesitated and said if i were sure that you she threw the spray away and continued this is silly we will change the subject no do not insist i must have my way in this then mr buckstone drew off his forces and proceeded to make a wily advance upon the fortress under cover of carefully contrived artifices and stratagems of war but he contended with an alert and suspicious enemy and so at the end of two hours it was manifest to him that he had made but little progress still he had made some he was sure of that laura sat alone and communed with herself he is fairly hooked poor thing i can play him at my leisure and land him when i choose he was all ready to be caught days and days ago i saw that very well he will vote for our bill no fear about that and moreover he will work for it too before i am done with him if he had a womans eyes he would have noticed that the spray of box had grown three inches since he first gave it to me but a man never sees anything and never suspects if i had shown him a whole bush he would have thought it was the same well it is a good nights work the committee is safe but this is a desperate game i am playing in these days a wearing sordid heartless game if i lose i lose everything even myself and if i win the game will it be worth its cost after all i do not know sometimes i doubt sometimes i half wish i had not begun but no matter i have begun and i will never turn back never while i live mr buckstone indulged in a reverie as he walked homeward she is shrewd and deep and plays her cards with considerable discretion but she will lose for all that there is no hurry i shall come out winner all in good time she is the most beautiful woman in the world and she surpassed herself tonight i suppose i must vote for that bill in the end maybe but that is not a matter of much consequence the government can stand it she is bent on capturing me that is plain but she will find by and by that what she took for a sleeping garrison was an ambuscade chapter xxxviii now this surprising news causd her fall in a trance life as she were dead no limbs she could advance then her dear brother came her from the ground he took and she spake up and said o my poor heart is broke the barnardcastle tragedy dont you think he is distinguished looking what that gawky looking person with miss hawkins there hes just speaking to mrs schoonmaker such highbred negligence and unconsciousness nothing studied see his fine eyes very they are moving this way now maybe he is coming here but he looks as helpless as a rag baby who is he blanche who is he and youve been here a week grace and dont know hes the catch of the season thats washington hawkins her brother no is it very old family old kentucky family i believe hes got enormous landed property in tennessee i think the family lost everything slaves and that sort of thing you know in the war but they have a great deal of land minerals mines and all that mr hawkins and his sister too are very much interested in the amelioration of the condition of the colored race they have some plan with senator dilworthy to convert a large part of their property to something another for the freedmen you dont say so i thought he was some guy from pennsylvania but he is different from others probably he has lived all his life on his plantation it was a day reception of mrs representative schoonmaker a sweet woman of simple and sincere manners her house was one of the most popular in washington there was less ostentation there than in some others and people liked to go where the atmosphere reminded them of the peace and purity of home mrs schoonmaker was as natural and unaffected in washington society as she was in her own new york house and kept up the spirit of homelife there with her husband and children and that was the reason probably why people of refinement liked to go there washington is a microcosm and one can suit himself with any sort of society within a radius of a mile to a large portion of the people who frequent washington or dwell where the ultra fashion the shoddy the jobbery are as utterly distasteful as they would he in a refined new england city schoonmaker was not exactly a leader in the house but he was greatly respected for his fine talents and his honesty no one would have thought of offering to carry national improvement directors relief stock for him these day receptions were attended by more women than men and those interested in the problem might have studied the costumes of the ladies present in view of this fact to discover whether women dress more for the eyes of women or for effect upon men it is a very important problem and has been a good deal discussed and its solution would form one fixed philosophical basis upon which to estimate womans character we are inclined to take a medium ground and aver that woman dresses to please herself and in obedience to a law of her own nature they are coming this way said blanche people who made way for them to pass turned to look at them washington began to feel that the eyes of the public were on him also and his eyes rolled about now towards the ceiling now towards the floor in an effort to look unconscious good morning miss hawkins delighted mr hawkins my friend miss medlar mr hawkins who was endeavoring to square himself for a bow put his foot through the train of mrs senator poplin who looked round with a scowl which turned into a smile as she saw who it was in extricating himself mr hawkins who had the care of his hat as well as the introduction on his mind shambled against miss blanche who said pardon with the prettiest accent as if the awkwardness were her own and mr hawkins righted himself dont you find it very warm today mr hawkins said blanche by way of a remark its awful hot said washington its warm for the season continued blanche pleasantly but i suppose you are accustomed to it she added with a general idea that the thermometer always stands at deg in all parts of the late slave states washington weather generally cannot be very congenial to you its congenial said washington brightening up when its not congealed thats very good did you hear grace mr hawkins says its congenial when its not congealed what is dear said grace who was talking with laura the conversation was now finely under way washington launched out an observation of his own did you see those japs miss leavitt oh yes arent they queer but so highbred so picturesque do you think that color makes any difference mr hawkins i used to be so prejudiced against color did you i never was i used to think my old mammy was handsome how interesting your life must have been i should like to hear about it washington was about settling himself into his narrative style when mrs gen mcfingal caught his eye have you been at the capitol today mr hawkins washington had not is anything uncommon going on they say it was very exciting the alabama business you know gen sutler of massachusetts defied england and they say he wants war he wants to make himself conspicuous more like said laura he always you have noticed talks with one eye on the gallery while the other is on the speaker well my husband says its nonsense to talk of war and wicked he knows what war is if we do have war i hope it will be for the patriots of cuba dont you think we want cuba mr hawkins i think we want it bad said washington and santo domingo senator dilworthy says we are bound to extend our religion over the isles of the sea weve got to round out our territory and washingtons further observations were broken off by laura who whisked him off to another part of the room and reminded him that they must make their adieux how stupid and tiresome these people are she said lets go they were turning to say goodby to the hostess when lauras attention was arrested by the sight of a gentleman who was just speaking to mrs schoonmaker for a second her heart stopped beating he was a handsome man of forty and perhaps more with grayish hair and whiskers and he walked with a cane as if he were slightly lame he might be less than forty for his face was worn into hard lines and he was pale no it could not be she said to herself it is only a resemblance but as the gentleman turned and she saw his full face laura put out her hand and clutched washingtons arm to prevent herself from falling washington who was not minding anything as usual looked round in wonder lauras eyes were blazing fire and hatred he had never seen her look so before and her face was livid why what is it sis your face is as white as paper its he its he come come and she dragged him away its who asked washington when they had gained the carriage its nobody its nothing did i say he i was faint with the heat dont mention it dont you speak of it she added earnestly grasping his arm when she had gained her room she went to the glass and saw a pallid and haggard face my god she cried this will never do i should have killed him if i could the scoundrel still lives and dares to come here i ought to kill him he has no right to live how i hate him and yet i loved him oh heavens how i did love that man and why didnt he kill me he might better he did kill all that was good in me oh but he shall not escape he shall not escape this time he may have forgotten he will find that a womans hate doesnt forget the law what would the law do but protect him and make me an outcast how all washington would gather up its virtuous skirts and avoid me if it knew i wonder if he hates me as i do him so laura raved in tears and in rage by turns tossed in a tumult of passion which she gave way to with little effort to control a servant came to summon her to dinner she had a headache the hour came for the presidents reception she had a raving headache and the senator must go without her that night of agony was like another night she recalled how vividly it all came back to her and at that time she remembered she thought she might be mistaken he might come back to her perhaps he loved her a little after all now she knew he did not now she knew he was a coldblooded scoundrel without pity never a word in all these years she had hoped he was dead did his wife live she wondered she caught at that and it gave a new current to her thoughts perhaps after all she must see him she could not live without seeing him would he smile as in the old days when she loved him so or would he sneer as when she last saw him if be looked so she hated him if he should call her laura darling and look so she must find him she must end her doubts laura kept her room for two days on one excuse and another a nervous headache a cold to the great anxiety of the senators household callers who went away said she had been too gay they did not say fast though some of them may have thought it one so conspicuous and successful in society as laura could not be out of the way two days without remarks being made and not all of them complimentary when she came down she appeared as usual a little pale may be but unchanged in manner if there were any deepened lines about the eyes they had been concealed her course of action was quite determined at breakfast she asked if any one had heard any unusual noise during the night nobody had washington never heard any noise of any kind after his eyes were shut some people thought he never did when they were open either senator dilworthy said he had come in late he was detained in a little consultation after the congressional prayer meeting perhaps it was his entrance no laura said she heard that it was later she might have been nervous but she fancied somebody was trying to get into the house mr brierly humorously suggested that it might be as none of the members were occupied in night session the senator frowned and said he did not like to hear that kind of newspaper slang there might be burglars about laura said that very likely it was only her nervousness but she thought she world feel safer if washington would let her take one of his pistols washington brought her one of his revolvers and instructed her in the art of loading and firing it during the morning laura drove down to mrs schoonmakers to pay a friendly call your receptions are always delightful she said to that lady the pleasant people all seem to come here its pleasant to hear you say so miss hawkins i believe my friends like to come here though society in washington is mixed we have a little of everything i suppose though you dont see much of the old rebel element said laura with a smile if this seemed to mrs schoonmaker a singular remark for a lady to make who was meeting rebels in society every day she did not express it in any way but only said you know we dont say rebel anymore before we came to washington i thought rebels would look unlike other people i find we are very much alike and that kindness and good nature wear away prejudice and then you know there are all sorts of common interests my husband sometimes says that he doesnt see but confederates are just as eager to get at the treasury as unionists you know that mr schoonmaker is on the appropriations does he know many southerners oh yes there were several at my reception the other day among others a confederate colonel a stranger handsome man with gray hair probably you didnt notice him uses a cane in walking a very agreeable man i wondered why he called when my husband came home and looked over the cards he said he had a cotton claim a real southerner perhaps you might know him if i could think of his name yes heres his card louisiana laura took the card looked at it intently till she was sure of the address and then laid it down with no he is no friend of ours that afternoon laura wrote and dispatched the following note it was in a round hand unlike her flowing style and it was directed to a number and street in georgetown a lady at senator dilworthys would like to see col george selby on business connected with the cotton claims can he call wednesday at three oclock p m on wednesday at p m no one of the family was likely to be in the house except laura chapter xxxix col selby had just come to washington and taken lodgings in georgetown his business was to get pay for some cotton that was destroyed during the war there were many others in washington on the same errand some of them with claims as difficult to establish as his a concert of action was necessary and he was not therefore at all surprised to receive the note from a lady asking him to call at senator dilworthys at a little after three on wednesday he rang the bell of the senators residence it was a handsome mansion on the square opposite the presidents house the owner must be a man of great wealth the colonel thought perhaps who knows said he with a smile he may have got some of my cotton in exchange for salt and quinine after the capture of new orleans as this thought passed through his mind he was looking at the remarkable figure of the hero of new orleans holding itself by main strength from sliding off the back of the rearing bronze horse and lifting its hat in the manner of one who acknowledges the playing of that martial air see the conquering hero comes gad said the colonel to himself old hickory ought to get down and give his seat to gen sutler but theyd have to tie him on laura was in the drawing room she heard the bell she heard the steps in the hall and the emphatic thud of the supporting cane she had risen from her chair and was leaning against the piano pressing her left hand against the violent beating of her heart the door opened and the colonel entered standing in the full light of the opposite window laura was more in the shadow and stood for an instant long enough for the colonel to make the inward observation that she was a magnificent woman she then advanced a step col selby is it not the colonel staggered back caught himself by a chair and turned towards her a look of terror laura my god yes your wife oh no it cant be how came you here i thought you were you thought i was dead you thought you were rid of me not so long as you live col selby not so long as you live laura in her passion was hurried on to say no man had ever accused col selby of cowardice but he was a coward before this woman may be he was not the man he once was where was his coolness where was his sneering imperturbable manner with which he could have met and would have met any woman he had wronged if he had only been forewarned he felt now that he must temporize that he must gain time there was danger in lauras tone there was something frightful in her calmness her steady eyes seemed to devour him you have ruined my life she said and i was so young so ignorant and loved you so you betrayed me and left me mocking me and trampling me into the dust a soiled castoff you might better have killed me then then i should not have hated you laura said the colonel nerving himself but still pale and speaking appealingly dont say that reproach me i deserve it i was a scoundrel i was everything monstrous but your beauty made me crazy you are right i was a brute in leaving you as i did but what could i do i was married and and your wife still lives asked laura bending a little forward in her eagerness the colonel noticed the action and he almost said no but he thought of the folly of attempting concealment yes she is here what little color had wandered back into lauras face forsook it again her heart stood still her strength seemed going from her limbs her last hope was gone the room swam before her for a moment and the colonel stepped towards her but she waved him back as hot anger again coursed through her veins and said and you dare come with her here and tell me of it here and mock me with it and you think i will have it george you think i will let you live with that woman you think i am as powerless as that day i fell dead at your feet she raged now she was in a tempest of excitement and she advanced towards him with a threatening mien she would kill me if she could thought the colonel but he thought at the same moment how beautiful she is he had recovered his head now she was lovely when he knew her then a simple country girl now she was dazzling in the fullness of ripe womanhood a superb creature with all the fascination that a woman of the world has for such a man as col selby nothing of this was lost on him he stepped quickly to her grasped both her hands in his and said laura stop think suppose i loved you yet suppose i hated my fate what can i do i am broken by the war i have lost everything almost i had as lief be dead and done with it the colonel spoke with a low remembered voice that thrilled through laura he was looking into her eyes as he had looked in those old days when no birds of all those that sang in the groves where they walked sang a note of warning he was wounded he had been punished her strength forsook her with her rage and she sank upon a chair sobbing oh my god i thought i hated him the colonel knelt beside her he took her hand and she let him keep it she looked down into his face with a pitiable tenderness and said in a weak voice and you do love me a little the colonel vowed and protested he kissed her hand and her lips he swore his false soul into perdition she wanted love this woman was not her love for george selby deeper than any other womans could be had she not a right to him did he not belong to her by virtue of her overmastering passion his wife she was not his wife except by the law she could not be even with the law she could have no right to stand between two souls that were one it was an infamous condition in society that george should be tied to her laura thought this believed it because she desired to believe it she came to it as an original propositions founded an the requirements of her own nature she may have heard doubtless she had similar theories that were prevalent at that day theories of the tyranny of marriage and of the freedom of marriage she had even heard women lecturers say that marriage should only continue so long as it pleased either party to it for a year or a month or a day she had not given much heed to this but she saw its justice now in a dash of revealing desire it must be right god would not have permitted her to love george selby as she did and him to love her if it was right for society to raise up a barrier between them he belonged to her had he not confessed it himself not even the religious atmosphere of senator dilworthys house had been sufficient to instill into laura that deep christian principle which had been somehow omitted in her training indeed in that very house had she not heard women prominent before the country and besieging congress utter sentiments that fully justified the course she was marking out for herself they were seated now side by side talking with more calmness laura was happy or thought she was but it was that feverish sort of happiness which is snatched out of the black shadow of falsehood and is at the moment recognized as fleeting and perilous and indulged tremblingly she loved she was loved that is happiness certainly and the black past and the troubled present and the uncertain future could not snatch that from her what did they say as they sat there what nothings do people usually say in such circumstances even if they are threescore and ten it was enough for laura to hear his voice and be near him it was enough for him to be near her and avoid committing himself as much as he could enough for him was the present also had there not always been some way out of such scrapes and yet laura could not be quite content without prying into tomorrow how could the colonel manage to free himself from his wife would it be long could he not go into some state where it would not take much time he could not say exactly that they must think of that they must talk over and so on did this seem like a damnable plot to laura against the life maybe of a sister a woman like herself probably not it was right that this man should be hers and there were some obstacles in the way that was all there are as good reasons for bad actions as for good ones to those who commit them when one has broken the tenth commandment the others are not of much account was it unnatural therefore that when george selby departed laura should watch him from the window with an almost joyful heart as he went down the sunny square i shall see him tomorrow she said and the next day and the next he is mine now damn the woman said the colonel as he picked his way down the steps or he added as his thoughts took a new turn i wish my wife was in new orleans chapter xl open your ears for which of you will stop the vent of hearing when loud rumor speaks i from the orient to the drooping west making the wind my posthorse still unfold the acts commenced on this ball of earth upon my tongues continual slanders ride the which in every language i pronounce stuffing the ears of men with false reports king henry iv as may be readily believed col beriah sellers was by this time one of the best known men in washington for the first time in his life his talents had a fair field he was now at the centre of the manufacture of gigantic schemes of speculations of all sorts of political and social gossip the atmosphere was full of little and big rumors and of vast undefined expectations everybody was in haste too to push on his private plan and feverish in his haste as if in constant apprehension that tomorrow would be judgment day work while congress is in session said the uneasy spirit for in the recess there is no work and no device the colonel enjoyed this bustle and confusion amazingly he thrived in the air ofindefinite expectation all his own schemes took larger shape and more misty and majestic proportions and in this congenial air the colonel seemed even to himself to expand into something large and mysterious if he respected himself before he almost worshipped beriah sellers now as a superior being if he could have chosen an official position out of the highest he would have been embarrassed in the selection the presidency of the republic seemed too limited and cramped in the constitutional restrictions if he could have been grand llama of the united states that might have come the nearest to his idea of a position and next to that he would have luxuriated in the irresponsible omniscience of the special correspondent col sellers knew the president very well and had access to his presence when officials were kept cooling their heels in the waitingroom the president liked to hear the colonel talk his voluble ease was a refreshment after the decorous dullness of men who only talked business and government and everlastingly expounded their notions of justice and the distribution of patronage the colonel was as much a lover of farming and of horses as thomas jefferson was he talked to the president by the hour about his magnificent stud and his plantation at hawkeye a kind of principality he represented it he urged the president to pay him a visit during the recess and see his stock farm the presidents table is well enough he used to say to the loafers who gathered about him at willards well enough for a man on a salary but god bless my soul i should like him to see a little oldfashioned hospitality open house you know a person seeing me at home might think i paid no attention to what was in the house just let things flow in and out hed be mistaken what i look to is quality sir the president has variety enough but the quality vegetables of course you cant expect here im very particular about mine take celery now theres only one spot in this country where celery will grow but i an surprised about the wines i should think they were manufactured in the new york custom house i must send the president some from my cellar i was really mortified the other day at dinner to see blacque bey leave his standing in the glasses when the colonel first came to washington he had thoughts of taking the mission to constantinople in order to be on the spot to look after the dissemination of his eye water but as that invention was not yet quite ready the project shrank a little in the presence of vaster schemes besides he felt that he could do the country more good by remaining at home he was one of the southerners who were constantly quoted as heartily accepting the situation im whipped he used to say with a jolly laugh the government was too many for me im cleaned out done for except my plantation and private mansion we played for a big thing and lost it and i dont whine for one i go for putting the old flag on all the vacant lots i said to the president says i grant why dont you take santo domingo annex the whole thing and settle the bill afterwards thats my way id take the job to manage congress the south would come into it youve got to conciliate the south consolidate the two debts pay em off in greenbacks and go ahead thats my notion boutwells got the right notion about the value of paper but he lacks courage i should like to run the treasury department about six months id make things plenty and business look up the colonel had access to the departments he knew all the senators and representatives and especially the lobby he was consequently a great favorite in newspaper row and was often lounging in the offices there dropping bits of private official information which were immediately caught up and telegraphed all over the country but it need to surprise even the colonel when he read it it was embellished to that degree that he hardly recognized it and the hint was not lost on him he began to exaggerate his heretofore simple conversation to suit the newspaper demand people used to wonder in the winters of and where the specials got that remarkable information with which they every morning surprised the country revealing the most secret intentions of the president and his cabinet the private thoughts of political leaders the hidden meaning of every movement this information was furnished by col sellers when he was asked afterwards about the stolen copy of the alabama treaty which got into the new york tribune he only looked mysterious and said that neither he nor senator dilworthy knew anything about it but those whom he was in the habit of meeting occasionally felt almost certain that he did know it must not be supposed that the colonel in his general patriotic labors neglected his own affairs the columbus river navigation scheme absorbed only a part of his time so he was enabled to throw quite a strong reserve force of energy into the tennessee land plan a vast enterprise commensurate with his abilities and in the prosecution of which he was greatly aided by mr henry brierly who was buzzing about the capitol and the hotels day and night and making capital for it in some mysterious way we must create a public opinion said senator dilworthy my only interest in it is a public one and if the country wants the institution congress will have to yield it may have been after a conversation between the colonel and senator dilworthy that the following special despatch was sent to a new york newspaper we understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to the colored race that will if successful revolutionize the whole character of southern industry an experimental institution is in contemplation in tennessee which will do for that state what the industrial school at zurich did for switzerland we learn that approaches have been made to the heirs of the late hon silas hawkins of missouri in reference to a lease of a portion of their valuable property in east tennessee senator dilworthy it is understood is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement that will not give the government absolute control private interests must give way to the public good it is to be hoped that col sellers who represents the heirs will be led to see the matter in this light when washington hawkins read this despatch he went to the colonel in some anxiety he was for a lease he didnt want to surrender anything what did he think the government would offer two millions may be three may be four said the colonel its worth more than the bank of england if they will not lease said washington let em make it two millions for an undivided half im not going to throw it away not the whole of it harry told the colonel that they must drive the thing through he couldnt be dallying round washington when spring opened phil wanted him phil had a great thing on hand up in pennsylvania what is that inquired the colonel always ready to interest himself in anything large a mountain of coal thats all hes going to run a tunnel into it in the spring does he want any capital asked the colonel in the tone of a man who is given to calculating carefully before he makes an investment no old man boltons behind him he has capital but i judged that he wanted my experience in starting if he wants me tell him ill come after congress adjourns i should like to give him a little lift he lacks enterprise now about that columbus river he doesnt see his chances but hes a good fellow and you can tell him that sellers wont go back on him by the way asked harry who is that rather handsome party thats hanging round laura i see him with her everywhere at the capitol in the horse cars and he comes to dilworthys if he werent lame i should think he was going to run off with her oh thats nothing laura knows her business he has a cotton claim used to be at hawkeye during the war selbys his name was a colonel got a wife and family very respectable people the selbys well thats all right said harry if its business but if a woman looked at me as ive seen her at selby i should understand it and its talked about i can tell you jealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentlemans observation laura could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she had been the queen of sheba on a royal visit to the great republic and he resented it and was huffy when he was with her and ran her errands and brought her gossip and bragged of his intimacy with the lovely creature among the fellows at newspaper row lauras life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and fashionable dissipation she was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest set and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that began late and ended early if senator dilworthy remonstrated about appearances she had a way of silencing him perhaps she had some hold on him perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the condition the tube colored race she saw col selby when the public knew and when it did not know she would see him whatever excuses he made and however he avoided her she was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy which alternately possessed her sometimes she petted him and coaxed him and tried all her fascinations and again she threatened him and reproached him what was he doing why had he taken no steps to free himself why didnt he send his wife home she should have money soon they could go to europe anywhere what did she care for talk and he promised and lied and invented fresh excuses for delay like a cowardly gambler and roue as he was fearing to break with her and half the time unwilling to give her up that woman doesnt know what fear is he said to himself and she watches me like a hawk he told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist whom he had to tolerate and use in getting through his claims and that he should pay her and have done with her when he succeeded chapter xli henry brierly was at the dilworthys constantly and on such terms of intimacy that he came and went without question the senator was not an inhospitable man he liked to have guests in his house and harrys gay humor and rattling way entertained him for even the most devout men and busy statesmen must have hours of relaxation harry himself believed that he was of great service in the university business and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a great degree he spent many hours in talking it over with the senator after dinner he went so far as to consider whether it would be worth his while to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new institution but it was not the senators society nor his dinners at which this scapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little wine which attracted him to the horse the fact was the poor fellow hung around there day after day for the chance of seeing laura for five minutes at a time for her presence at dinner he would endure the long bore of the senators talk afterwards while laura was off at some assembly or excused herself on the plea of fatigue now and then he accompanied her to some reception and rarely on off nights he was blessed with her company in the parlor when he sang and was chatty and vivacious and performed a hundred little tricks of imitation and ventriloquism and made himself as entertaining as a man could be it puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for so little with laura it was beyond his experience with women sometimes laura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little and took the trouble to exert her powers of pleasing and to entangle him deeper and deeper but this it angered him afterwards to think was in private in public she was beyond his reach and never gave occasion to the suspicion that she had any affair with him he was never permitted to achieve the dignity of a serious flirtation with her in public why do you treat me so he once said reproachfully treat you how asked laura in a sweet voice lifting her eyebrows you know well enough you let other fellows monopolize you in society and you are as indifferent to me as if we were strangers can i help it if they are attentive can i be rude but we are such old friends mr brierly that i didnt suppose you would be jealous i think i must be a very old friend then by your conduct towards me by the same rule i should judge that col selby must be very new laura looked up quickly as if about to return an indignant answer to such impertinence but she only said well what of col selby saucebox nothing probably youll care for your being with him so much is the town talk thats all what do people say asked laura calmly oh they say a good many things you are offended though to have me speak of it not in the least you are my true friend i feel that i can trust you you wouldnt deceive me harry throwing into her eyes a look of trust and tenderness that melted away all his petulance and distrust what do they say some say that youve lost your head about him others that you dont care any more for him than you do for a dozen others but that he is completely fascinated with you and about to desert his wife and others say it is nonsense to suppose you would entangle yourself with a married man and that your intimacy only arises from the matter of the cotton claims for which he wants your influence with dilworthy but you know everybody is talked about more or less in washington i shouldnt care but i wish you wouldnt have so much to do with selby laura continued harry fancying that he was now upon such terms that his advice would be heeded and you believed these slanders i dont believe anything against you laura but col selby does not mean you any good i know you wouldnt be seen with him if you knew his reputation do you know him laura asked as indifferently as she could only a little i was at his lodgings in georgetown a day or two ago with col sellers sellers wanted to talk with him about some patent remedy he has eye water or something of that sort which he wants to introduce into europe selby is going abroad very soon laura started in spite of her selfcontrol and his wife does he take his family did you see his wife yes a dark little woman rather worn must have been pretty once though has three or four children one of them a baby theyll all go of course she said she should be glad enough to get away from washington you know selby has got his claim allowed and they say he has had a run of luck lately at morrisseys laura heard all this in a kind of stupor looking straight at harry without seeing him is it possible she was thinking that this base wretch after all his promises will take his wife and children and leave me is it possible the town is saying all these things about me and a look of bitterness coming into her face does the fool think he can escape so you are angry with me laura said harry not comprehending in the least what was going on in her mind angry she said forcing herself to come back to his presence with you oh no im angry with the cruel world which pursues an independent woman as it never does a man im grateful to you harry im grateful to you for telling me of that odious man and she rose from her chair and gave him her pretty hand which the silly fellow took and kissed and clung to and he said many silly things before she disengaged herself gently and left him saying it was time to dress for dinner and harry went away excited and a little hopeful but only a little the happiness was only a gleam which departed and left him thoroughly miserable she never would love him and she was going to the devil besides he couldnt shut his eyes to what he saw nor his ears to what he heard of her what had come over this thrilling young ladykiller it was a pity to see such a gay butterfly broken on a wheel was there something good in him after all that had been touched he was in fact madly in love with this woman it is not for us to analyze the passion and say whether it was a worthy one it absorbed his whole nature and made him wretched enough if he deserved punishment what more would you have perhaps this love was kindling a new heroism in him he saw the road on which laura was going clearly enough though he did not believe the worst he heard of her he loved her too passionately to credit that for a moment and it seemed to him that if he could compel her to recognize her position and his own devotion she might love him and that he could save her his love was so far ennobled and become a very different thing from its beginning in hawkeye whether he ever thought that if he could save her from ruin he could give her up himself is doubtful such a pitch of virtue does not occur often in real life especially in such natures as harrys whose generosity and unselfishness were matters of temperament rather than habits or principles he wrote a long letter to laura an incoherent passionate letter pouring out his love as he could not do in her presence and warning her as plainly as he dared of the dangers that surrounded her and the risks she ran of compromising herself in many ways laura read the letter with a little sigh may be as she thought of other days but with contempt also and she put it into the fire with the thought they are all alike harry was in the habit of writing to philip freely and boasting also about his doings as he could not help doing and remain himself mixed up with his own exploits and his daily triumphs as a lobbyist especially in the matter of the new university in which harry was to have something handsome were amusing sketches of washington society hints about dilworthy stories about col sellers who had become a wellknown character and wise remarks upon the machinery of private legislation for the publicgood which greatly entertained philip in his convalescence lauras name occurred very often in these letters at first in casual mention as the belle of the season carrying everything before her with her wit and beauty and then more seriously as if harry did not exactly like so much general admiration of her and was a little nettled by her treatment of him this was so different from harrys usual tone about women that philip wondered a good deal over it could it be possible that he was seriously affected then came stories about laura town talk gossip which harry denied the truth of indignantly but he was evidently uneasy and at length wrote in such miserable spirits that philip asked him squarely what the trouble was was he in love upon this harry made a clean breast of it and told philip all he knew about the selby affair and lauras treatment of him sometimes encouraging him and then throwing him off and finally his belief that she would go to the bad if something was not done to arouse her from her infatuation he wished philip was in washington he knew laura and she had a great respect for his character his opinions his judgment perhaps he as an uninterested person whom she would have some confidence and as one of the public could say some thing to her that would show her where she stood philip saw the situation clearly enough of laura he knew not much except that she was a woman of uncommon fascination and he thought from what he had seen of her in hawkeye her conduct towards him and towards harry of not too much principle of course he knew nothing of her history he knew nothing seriously against her and if harry was desperately enamored of her why should he not win her if he could if however she had already become what harry uneasily felt she might become was it not his duty to go to the rescue of his friend and try to save him from any rash act on account of a woman that might prove to be entirely unworthy of him for trifler and visionary as he was harry deserved a better fate than this philip determined to go to washington and see for himself he had other reasons also he began to know enough of mr boltons affairs to be uneasy pennybacker had been there several times during the winter and he suspected that he was involving mr bolton in some doubtful scheme pennybacker was in washington and philip thought he might perhaps find out something about him and his plans that would be of service to mr bolton philip had enjoyed his winter very well for a man with his arm broken and his head smashed with two such nurses as ruth and alice illness seemed to him rather a nice holiday and every moment of his convalescence had been precious and all too fleeting with a young fellow of the habits of philip such injuries cannot be counted on to tarry long even for the purpose of lovemaking and philip found himself getting strong with even disagreeable rapidity during his first weeks of pain and weakness ruth was unceasing in her ministrations she quietly took charge of him and with a gentle firmness resisted all attempts of alice or any one else to share to any great extent the burden with her she was clear decisive and peremptory in whatever she did but often when philip opened his eyes in those first days of suffering and found her standing by his bedside he saw a look of tenderness in her anxious face that quickened his already feverish pulse a look that remained in his heart long after he closed his eyes sometimes he felt her hand on his forehead and did not open his eyes for fear she world take it away he watched for her coming to his chamber he could distinguish her light footstep from all others if this is what is meant by women practicing medicine thought philip to himself i like it ruth said he one day when he was getting to be quite himself i believe in it believe in what why in women physicians then id better call in mrs dr longstreet oh no one will do one at a time i think i should be well tomorrow if i thought i should never have any other thy physician thinks thee mustnt talk philip said ruth putting her finger on his lips but ruth i want to tell you that i should wish i never had got well if there there thee must not talk thee is wandering again and ruth closed his lips with a smile on her own that broadened into a merry laugh as she ran away philip was not weary however of making these attempts he rather enjoyed it but whenever he inclined to be sentimental ruth would cut him off with some such gravely conceived speech as does thee think that thy physician will take advantage of the condition of a man who is as weak as thee is i will call alice if thee has any dying confessions to make as philip convalesced alice more and more took ruths place as his entertainer and read to him by the hour when he did not want to talk to talk about ruth as he did a good deal of the time nor was this altogether unsatisfactory to philip he was always happy and contented with alice she was the most restful person he knew better informed than ruth and with a much more varied culture and bright and sympathetic he was never weary of her company if he was not greatly excited by it she had upon his mind that peaceful influence that mrs bolton had when occasionally she sat by his bedside with her work some people have this influence which is like an emanation they bring peace to a house they diffuse serene content in a room full of mixed company though they may say very little and are apparently unconscious of their own power not that philip did not long for ruths presence all the same since he was well enough to be about the house she was busy again with her studies now and then her teasing humor came again she always had a playful shield against his sentiment philip used sometimes to declare that she had no sentiment and then he doubted if he should be pleased with her after all if she were at all sentimental and he rejoiced that she had in such matters what he called the airy grace of sanity she was the most gay serious person he ever saw perhaps he waw not so much at rest or so contented with her as with alice but then he loved her and what have rest and contentment to do with love chapter xlii mr buckstones campaign was brief much briefer than he supposed it would be he began it purposing to win laura without being won himself but his experience was that of all who had fought on that field before him he diligently continued his effort to win her but he presently found that while as yet he could not feel entirely certain of having won her it was very manifest that she had won him he had made an able fight brief as it was and that at least was to his credit he was in good company now he walked in a leash of conspicuous captives these unfortunates followed laura helplessly for whenever she took a prisoner he remained her slave henceforth sometimes they chafed in their bondage sometimes they tore themselves free and said their serfdom was ended but sooner or later they always came back penitent and worshiping laura pursued her usual course she encouraged mr buckstone by turns and by turns she harassed him she exalted him to the clouds at one time and at another she dragged him down again she constituted him chief champion of the knobs university bill and he accepted the position at first reluctantly but later as a valued means of serving her he even came to look upon it as a piece of great good fortune since it brought him into such frequent contact with her through him she learned that the hon mr trollop was a bitter enemy of her bill he urged her not to attempt to influence mr trollop in any way and explained that whatever she might attempt in that direction would surely be used against her and with damaging effect she at first said she knew mr trollop and was aware that he had a blankblank her private figure of speech for brother or soninlaw but mr buckstone said that he was not able to conceive what so curious a phrase as blankblank might mean and had no wish to pry into the matter since it was probably private he would nevertheless venture the blind assertion that nothing would answer in this particular case and during this particular session but to be exceedingly wary and keep clear away from mr trollop any other course would be fatal it seemed that nothing could be done laura was seriously troubled everything was looking well and yet it was plain that one vigorous and determined enemy might eventually succeed in overthrowing all her plans a suggestion came into her mind presently and she said cant you fight against his great pension bill and bring him to terms oh never he and i are sworn brothers on that measure we work in harness and are very loving i do everything i possibly can for him there but i work with might and main against his immigration bill as pertinaciously and as vindictively indeed as he works against our university we hate each other through half a conversation and are all affection through the other half we understand each other he is an admirable worker outside the capitol he will do more for the pension bill than any other man could do i wish he would make the great speech on it which he wants to make and then i would make another and we would be safe well if he wants to make a great speech why doesnt he do it visitors interrupted the conversation and mr buckstone took his leave it was not of the least moment to laura that her question had not been answered inasmuch as it concerned a thing which did not interest her and yet human being like she thought she would have liked to know an opportunity occurring presently she put the same question to another person and got an answer that satisfied her she pondered a good while that night after she had gone to bed and when she finally turned over to go to sleep she had thought out a new scheme the next evening at mrs gloversons party she said to mr buckstone i want mr trollop to make his great speech on the pension bill do you but you remember i was interrupted and did not explain to you never mind i know you must make him make that speech i very particularly desire it oh it is easy to say make him do it but how am i to make him it is perfectly easy i have thought it all out she then went into the details at length mr buckstone said i see now i can manage it i am sure indeed i wonder he never thought of it himself there are no end of precedents but how is this going to benefit you after i have managed it there is where the mystery lies but i will take care of that it will benefit me a great deal i only wish i could see how it is the oddest freak you seem to go the furthest around to get at a thing but you are in earnest arent you yes i am indeed very well i will do it but why not tell me how you imagine it is going to help you i will by and by now there is nobody talking to him go straight and do it theres a good fellow a moment or two later the two sworn friends of the pension bill were talking together earnestly and seemingly unconscious of the moving throng about them they talked an hour and then mr buckstone came back and said he hardly fancied it at first but he fell in love with it after a bit and we have made a compact too i am to keep his secret and he is to spare me in future when he gets ready to denounce the supporters of the university bill and i can easily believe he will keep his word on this occasion a fortnight elapsed and the university bill had gathered to itself many friends meantime senator dilworthy began to think the harvest was ripe he conferred with laura privately she was able to tell him exactly how the house would vote there was a majority the bill would pass unless weak members got frightened at the last and deserted a thing pretty likely to occur the senator said i wish we had one more good strong man now trollop ought to be on our side for he is a friend of the negro but he is against us and is our bitterest opponent if he would simply vote no but keep quiet and not molest us i would feel perfectly cheerful and content but perhaps there is no use in thinking of that why i laid a little plan for his benefit two weeks ago i think he will be tractable maybe he is to come here tonight look out for him my child he means mischief sure it is said that he claims to know of improper practices having been used in the interest of this bill and he thinks be sees a chance to make a great sensation when the bill comes up be wary be very very careful my dear do your veryablest talking now you can convince a man of anything when you try you must convince him that if anything improper has been done you at least are ignorant of it and sorry for it and if you could only persuade him out of his hostility to the bill too but dont overdo the thing dont seem too anxious dear i wont ill be ever so careful ill talk as sweetly to him as if he were my own child you may trust me indeed you may the doorbell rang that is the gentleman now said laura senator dilworthy retired to his study laura welcomed mr trollop a grave carefully dressed and very respectable looking man with a bald head standing collar and old fashioned watch seals promptness is a virtue mr trollop and i perceive that you have it you are always prompt with me i always meet my engagements of every kind miss hawkins it is a quality which is rarer in the world than it has been i believe i wished to see you on business mr trollop i judged so what can i do for you you know my bill the knobs university bill ah i believe it is your bill i had forgotten yes i know the bill well would you mind telling me your opinion of it indeed since you seem to ask it without reserve i am obliged to say that i do not regard it favorably i have not seen the bill itself but from what i can hear it it well it has a bad look about it it speak it out never fear well it they say it contemplates a fraud upon the government well said laura tranquilly well i say well too well suppose it were a fraud which i feel able to deny would it be the first one you take a bodys breath away would you did you wish me to vote for it was that what you wanted to see me about your instinct is correct i did want you i do want you to vote for it vote for a fr for a measure which is generally believed to be at least questionable i am afraid we cannot come to an understanding miss hawkins no i am afraid not if you have resumed your principles mr trollop did you send for we merely to insult me it is time for me to take my leave miss hawkins nowait a moment dont be offended at a trifle do not be offish and unsociable the steamship subsidy bill was a fraud on the government you voted for it mr trollop though you always opposed the measure until after you had an interview one evening with a certain mrs mccarter at her house she was my agent she was acting for me ah that is right sit down again you can be sociable easily enough if you have a mind to well i am waiting have you nothing to say miss hawkins i voted for that bill because when i came to examine into it ah yes when you came to examine into it well i only want you to examine into my bill mr trollop you would not sell your vote on that subsidy bill which was perfectly right but you accepted of some of the stock with the understanding that it was to stand in your brotherinlaws name there is no pr i mean this is utterly groundless miss hawkins but the gentleman seemed somewhat uneasy nevertheless well not entirely so perhaps i and a person whom we will call miss blank never mind the real name were in a closet at your elbow all the while mr trollop winced then he said with dignity miss hawkins is it possible that you were capable of such a thing as that it was bad i confess that it was bad almost as bad as selling ones vote for but i forget you did not sell your vote you only accepted a little trifle a small token of esteem for your brotherinlaw oh let us come out and be frank with each other i know you mr trollop i have met you on business three or four times true i never offered to corrupt your principles never hinted such a thing but always when i had finished sounding you i manipulated you through an agent let us be frank wear this comely disguise of virtue before the public it will count there but here it is out of place my dear sir by and by there is going to be an investigation into that national internal improvement directors relief measure of a few years ago and you know very well that you will be a crippled man as likely as not when it is completed it cannot be shown that a man is a knave merely for owning that stock i am not distressed about the national improvement relief measure oh indeed i am not trying to distress you i only wished to make good my assertion that i knew you several of you gentlemen bought of that stack without paying a penny down received dividends from it think of the happy idea of receiving dividends and very large ones too from stock one hasnt paid for and all the while your names never appeared in the transaction if ever you took the stock at all you took it in other peoples names now you see you had to know one of two things namely you either knew that the idea of all this preposterous generosity was to bribe you into future legislative friendship or you didnt know it that is to say you had to be either a knave or a well a fool there was no middle ground you are not a fool mr trollop miss hawking you flatter me but seriously you do not forget that some of the best and purest men in congress took that stock in that way did senator bland well no i believe not of course you believe not do you suppose he was ever approached on the subject perhaps not if you had approached him for instance fortified with the fact that some of the best men in congress and the purest etc etc what would have been the result well what would have been the result he would have shown you the door for mr blank is neither a knave nor a fool there are other men in the senate and the house whom no one would have been hardy enough to approach with that relief stock in that peculiarly generous way but they are not of the class that you regard as the best and purest no i say i know you mr trollop that is to say one may suggest a thing to mr trollop which it would not do to suggest to mr blank mr trollop you are pledged to support the indigent congressmens retroactive appropriation which is to come up either in this or the next session you do not deny that even in public the man that will vote for that bill will break the eighth commandment in any other way sir but he will not vote for your corrupt measure nevertheless madam exclaimed mr trollop rising from his seat in a passion ah but he will sit down again and let me explain why oh come dont behave so it is very unpleasant now be good and you shall have the missing page of your great speech here it is and she displayed a sheet of manuscript mr trollop turned immediately back from the threshold it might have been gladness that flashed into his face it might have been something else but at any rate there was much astonishment mixed with it good where did you get it give it me now there is no hurry sit down sit down and let us talk and be friendly the gentleman wavered then he said no this is only a subterfuge i will go it is not the missing page laura tore off a couple of lines from the bottom of the sheet now she said you will know whether this is the handwriting or not you know it is the handwriting now if you will listen you will know that this must be the list of statistics which was to be the nub of your great effort and the accompanying blast the beginning of the burst of eloquence which was continued on the next page and you will recognize that there was where you broke down she read the page mr trollop said this is perfectly astounding still what is all this to me it is nothing it does not concern me the speech is made and there an end i did break down for a moment and in a rather uncomfortable place since i had led up to those statistics with some grandeur the hiatus was pleasanter to the house and the galleries than it was to me but it is no matter now a week has passed the jests about it ceased three or four days ago the whole thing is a matter of indifference to me miss hawkins but you apologized and promised the statistics for next day why didnt you keep your promise the matter was not of sufficient consequence the time was gone by to produce an effect with them but i hear that other friends of the soldiers pension bill desire them very much i think you ought to let them have them miss hawkins this silly blunder of my copyist evidently has more interest for you than it has for me i will send my private secretary to you and let him discuss the subject with you at length did he copy your speech for you of course he did why all these questions tell me how did you get hold of that page of manuscript that is the only thing that stirs a passing interest in my mind im coming to that then she said much as if she were talking to herself it does seem like taking a deal of unnecessary pains for a body to hire another body to construct a great speech for him and then go and get still another body to copy it before it can be read in the house miss hawkins what do yo mean by such talk as that why i am sure i mean no harm no harm to anybody in the world i am certain that i overheard the hon mr buckstone either promise to write your great speech for you or else get some other competent person to do it this is perfectly absurd madam perfectly absurd and mr trollop affected a laugh of derision why the thing has occurred before now i mean that i have heard that congressmen have sometimes hired literary grubs to build speeches for them now didnt i overhear a conversation like that i spoke of pshaw why of course you may have overheard some such jesting nonsense but would one be in earnest about so farcical a thing well if it was only a joke why did you make a serious matter of it why did you get the speech written for you and then read it in the house without ever having it copied mr trollop did not laugh this time he seemed seriously perplexed he said come play out your jest miss hawkins i cant understand what you are contriving but it seems to entertain you so please go on i will i assure you but i hope to make the matter entertaining to you too your private secretary never copied your speech indeed really you seem to know my affairs better than i do myself i believe i do you cant name your own amanuensis mr trollop that is sad indeed perhaps miss hawkins can yes i can i wrote your speech myself and you read it from my manuscript there now mr trollop did not spring to his feet and smite his brow with his hand while a cold sweat broke out all over him and the color forsook his face no he only said good god and looked greatly astonished laura handed him her commonplacebook and called his attention to the fact that the handwriting there and the handwriting of this speech were the same he was shortly convinced he laid the book aside and said composedly well the wonderful tragedy is done and it transpires that i am indebted to you for my late eloquence what of it what was all this for and what does it amount to after all what do you propose to do about it oh nothing it is only a bit of pleasantry when i overheard that conversation i took an early opportunity to ask mr buckstone if he knew of anybody who might want a speech written i had a friend and so forth and so on i was the friend myself i thought i might do you a good turn then and depend on you to do me one by and by i never let mr buckstone have the speech till the last moment and when you hurried off to the house with it you did not know there was a missing page of course but i did and now perhaps you think that if i refuse to support your bill you will make a grand exposure well i had not thought of that i only kept back the page for the mere fun of the thing but since you mention it i dont know but i might do something if i were angry my dear miss hawkins if you were to give out that you composed my speech you know very well that people would say it was only your raillery your fondness for putting a victim in the pillory and amusing the public at his expense it is too flimsy miss hawkins for a person of your fine inventive talent contrive an abler device than that come it is easily done mr trollop i will hire a man and pin this page on his breast and label it the missing fragment of the hon mr trollops great speech which speech was written and composed by miss laura hawkins under a secret understanding for one hundred dollars and the money has not been paid and i will pin round about it notes in my handwriting which i will procure from prominent friends of mine for the occasion also your printed speech in the globe showing the connection between its bracketed hiatus and my fragment and i give you my word of honor that i will stand that human bulletin board in the rotunda of the capitol and make him stay there a week you see you are premature mr trollop the wonderful tragedy is not done yet by any means come now doesnt it improve mr trollop opened his eyes rather widely at this novel aspect of the case he got up and walked the floor and gave himself a moment for reflection then he stopped and studied lauras face a while and ended by saying well i am obliged to believe you would be reckless enough to do that then dont put me to the test mr trollop but lets drop the matter i have had my joke and youve borne the infliction becomingly enough it spoils a jest to harp on it after one has had ones laugh i would much rather talk about my bill so would i now my clandestine amanuensis compared with some other subjects even your bill is a pleasant topic to discuss very good indeed i thought i could persuade you now i am sure you will be generous to the poor negro and vote for that bill yes i feel more tenderly toward the oppressed colored man than i did shall we bury the hatchet and be good friends and respect each others little secrets on condition that i vote aye on the measure with all my heart mr trollop i give you my word of that it is a bargain but isnt there something else you could give me too laura looked at him inquiringly a moment and then she comprehended oh yes you may have it now i havent any more use for it she picked up the page of manuscript but she reconsidered her intention of handing it to him and said but never mind i will keep it close no one shall see it you shall have it as soon as your vote is recorded mr trollop looked disappointed but presently made his adieux and had got as far as the hall when something occurred to laura she said to herself i dont simply want his vote under compulsion he might vote aye but work against the bill in secret for revenge that man is unscrupulous enough to do anything i must have his hearty cooperation as well as his vote there is only one way to get that she called him back and said i value your vote mr trollop but i value your influence more you are able to help a measure along in many ways if you choose i want to ask you to work for the bill as well as vote for it it takes so much of ones time miss hawkins and time is money you know yes i know it is especially in congress now there is no use in you and i dealing in pretenses and going at matters in roundabout ways we know each other disguises are nonsense let us be plain i will make it an object to you to work for the bill dont make it unnecessarily plain please there are little proprieties that are best preserved what do you propose well this she mentioned the names of several prominent congressmen now said she these gentlemen are to vote and work for the bill simply out of love for the negro and out of pure generosity i have put in a relative of each as a member of the university incorporation they will handle a million or so of money officially but will receive no salaries a larger number of statesmen are to vote and work for the bill also out of love for the negro gentlemen of but moderate influence these and out of pure generosity i am to see that relatives of theirs have positions in the university with salaries and good ones too you will vote and work for the bill from mere affection for the negro and i desire to testify my gratitude becomingly make free choice have you any friend whom you would like to present with a salaried or unsalaried position in our institution well i have a brotherinlaw that same old brotherinlaw you good unselfish provider i have heard of him often through my agents how regularly he does turn up to be sure he could deal with those millions virtuously and withal with ability too but of course you would rather he had a salaried position oh no said the gentleman facetiously we are very humble very humble in our desires we want no money we labor solely for our country and require no reward but the luxury of an applauding conscience make him one of those poor hard working unsalaried corporators and let him do every body good with those millions and go hungry himself i will try to exert a little influence in favor of the bill arrived at home mr trollop sat down and thought it all over something after this fashion it is about the shape it might have taken if he had spoken it aloud my reputation is getting a little damaged and i meant to clear it up brilliantly with an exposure of this bill at the supreme moment and ride back into congress on the eclat of it and if i had that bit of manuscript i would do it yet it would be more money in my pocket in the end than my brotherinlaw will get out of that incorporatorship fat as it is but that sheet of paper is out of my reach she will never let that get out of her hands and what a mountain it is it blocks up my road completely she was going to hand it to me once why didnt she must be a deep woman deep devil that is what she is a beautiful devil and perfectly fearless too the idea of her pinning that paper on a man and standing him up in the rotunda looks absurd at a first glance but she would do it she is capable of doing anything i went there hoping she would try to bribe me good solid capital that would be in the exposure well my prayer was answered she did try to bribe me and i made the best of a bad bargain and let her i am checkmated i must contrive something fresh to get back to congress on very well a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush i will work for the bill the incorporatorship will be a very good thing as soon as mr trollop had taken his leave laura ran to senator dilworthy and began to speak but he interrupted her and said distressfully without even turning from his writing to look at her only half an hour you gave it up early child however it was best it was best im sure it was best and safest give it up i the senator sprang up all aglow my child you cant mean that you ive made him promise on honor to think about a compromise tonight and come and tell me his decision in the morning good theres hope yet that nonsense uncle ive made him engage to let the tennessee land bill utterly alone impossible you ive made him promise to vote with us incredible abso ive made him swear that hell work for us preposterous utterly pre break a window child before i suffocate no matter its true anyway now we can march into congress with drums beating and colors flying well well well im sadly bewildered sadly bewildered i cant understand it at all the most extraordinary woman that ever its a great day its a great day there there let me put my hand in benediction on this precious head ah my child the poor negro will bless oh bother the poor negro uncle put it in your speech goodnight goodbye well marshal our forces and march with the dawn laura reflected a while when she was alone and then fell to laughing peacefully everybody works for me so ran her thought it was a good idea to make buckstone lead mr trollop on to get a great speech written for him and it was a happy part of the same idea for me to copy the speech after mr buckstone had written it and then keep back a page mr b was very complimentary to me when trollops breakdown in the house showed him the object of my mysterious scheme i think he will say still finer things when i tell him the triumph the sequel to it has gained for us but what a coward the man was to believe i would have exposed that page in the rotunda and so exposed myself however i dont know i dont know i will think a moment suppose he voted no suppose the bill failed that is to suppose this stupendous game lost forever that i have played so desperately for suppose people came around pitying me odious and he could have saved me by his single voice yes i would have exposed him what would i care for the talk that that would have made about me when i was gone to europe with selby and all the world was busy with my history and my dishonor it would be almost happiness to spite somebody at such a time chapter xliii the very next day sure enough the campaign opened in due course the speaker of the house reached that order of business which is termed notices of bills and then the hon mr buckstone rose in his place and gave notice of a bill to found and incorporate the knobs industrial university and then sat down without saying anything further the busy gentlemen in the reporters gallery jotted a line in their notebooks ran to the telegraphic desk in a room which communicated with their own writingparlor and then hurried back to their places in the gallery and by the time they had resumed their seats the line which they had delivered to the operator had been read in telegraphic offices in towns and cities hundreds of miles away it was distinguished by frankness of language as well as by brevity the child is born buckstone gives notice of the thieving knobs university job it is said the noses have been counted and enough votes have been bought to pass it for some time the correspondents had been posting their several journals upon the alleged disreputable nature of the bill and furnishing daily reports of the washington gossip concerning it so the next morning nearly every newspaper of character in the land assailed the measure and hurled broadsides of invective at mr buckstone the washington papers were more respectful as usual and conciliatory also as usual they generally supported measures when it was possible but when they could not they deprecated violent expressions of opinion in other journalistic quarters they always deprecated when there was trouble ahead however the washington daily lovefeast hailed the bill with warm approbation this was senator balaams paper or rather brother balaam as he was popularly called for he had been a clergyman in his day and he himself and all that he did still emitted an odor of sanctity now that he had diverged into journalism and politics he was a power in the congressional prayer meeting and in all movements that looked to the spread of religion and temperance his paper supported the new bill with gushing affection it was a noble measure it was a just measure it was a generous measure it was a pure measure and that surely should recommend it in these corrupt times and finally if the nature of the bill were not known at all the love feast would support it anyway and unhesitatingly for the fact that senator dilworthy was the originator of the measure was a guaranty that it contemplated a worthy and righteous work senator dilworthy was so anxious to know what the new york papers would say about the bill that he had arranged to have synopses of their editorials telegraphed to him he could not wait for the papers themselves to crawl along down to washington by a mail train which has never run over a cow since the road was built for the reason that it has never been able to overtake one it carries the usual cowcatcher in front of the locomotive but this is mere ostentation it ought to be attached to the rear car where it could do some good but instead no provision is made there for the protection of the traveling public and hence it is not a matter of surprise that cows so frequently climb aboard that train and among the passengers the senator read his dispatches aloud at the breakfast table laura was troubled beyond measure at their tone and said that that sort of comment would defeat the bill but the senator said oh not at all not at all my child it is just what we want persecution is the one thing needful now all the other forces are secured give us newspaper persecution enough and we are safe vigorous persecution will alone carry a bill sometimes dear and when you start with a strong vote in the first place persecution comes in with double effect it scares off some of the weak supporters true but it soon turns strong ones into stubborn ones and then presently it changes the tide of public opinion the great public is weakminded the great public is sentimental the great public always turns around and weeps for an odious murderer and prays forhim and carries flowers to his prison and besieges the governor with appeals to his clemency as soon as the papers begin to howl for that mans blood in a word the great puttyhearted public loves to gush and there is no such darling opportunity to gush as a case of persecution affords well uncle dear if your theory is right let us go into raptures for nobody can ask a heartier persecution than these editorials are furnishing i am not so sure of that my daughter i dont entirely like the tone of some of these remarks they lack vim they lack venom here is one calls it a questionable measure bah there is no strength in that this one is better it calls it highway robbery that sounds something like but now this one seems satisfied to call it an iniquitous scheme iniquitous does not exasperate anybody it is weak puerile the ignorant will imagine it to be intended for a compliment but this other one the one i read last has the true ring this vile dirty effort to rob the public treasury by the kites and vultures that now infest the filthy den called congress that is admirable admirable we must have more of that sort but it will come no fear of that theyre not warmed up yet a week from now youll see uncle you and brother balaam are bosom friends why dont you get his paper to persecute us too it isnt worth while my daughter his support doesnt hurt a bill nobody reads his editorials but himself but i wish the new york papers would talk a little plainer it is annoying to have to wait a week for them to warm up i expected better things at their hands and time is precious now at the proper hour according to his previous notice mr buckstone duly introduced his bill entitled an act to found and incorporate the knobs industrial university moved its proper reference and sat down the speaker of the house rattled off this observation fnobjectionbilltakuzhlcoixrssoreferred habitues of the house comprehended that this long lightningheeled word signified that if there was no objection the bill would take the customary course of a measure of its nature and be referred to the committee on benevolent appropriations and that it was accordingly so referred strangers merely supposed that the speaker was taking a gargle for some affection of the throat the reporters immediately telegraphed the introduction of the bill and they added the assertion that the bill will pass was premature it is said that many favorers of it will desert when the storm breaks upon them from the public press the storm came and during ten days it waxed more and more violent day by day the great negro university swindle became the one absorbing topic of conversation throughout the union individuals denounced it journals denounced it public meetings denounced it the pictorial papers caricatured its friends the whole nation seemed to be growing frantic over it meantime the washington correspondents were sending such telegrams as these abroad in the land under date of saturday congressmen jex and fluke are wavering it is believed they will desert the execrable bill monday jex and fluke have deserted thursday tubbs and huffy left the sinking ship last night later on three desertions the university thieves are getting scared though they will not own it later the leaders are growing stubborn they swear they can carry it but it is now almost certain that they no longer have a majority after a day or two of reluctant and ambiguous telegrams public sentiment seems changing a trifle in favor of the bill but only a trifle and still later it is whispered that the hon mr trollop has gone over to the pirates it is probably a canard mr trollop has all along been the bravest and most efficient champion of virtue and the people against the bill and the report is without doubt a shameless invention next day with characteristic treachery the truckling and pusillanimous reptile crippledspeech trollop has gone over to the enemy it is contended now that he has been a friend to the bill in secret since the day it was introduced and has had bankable reasons for being so but he himself declares that he has gone over because the malignant persecution of the bill by the newspapers caused him to study its provisions with more care than he had previously done and this close examination revealed the fact that the measure is one in every way worthy of support pretty thin it cannot be denied that this desertion has had a damaging effect jex and fluke have returned to their iniquitous allegiance with six or eight others of lesser calibre and it is reported and believed that tubbs and huffy are ready to go back it is feared that the university swindle is stronger today than it has ever been before latermidnight it is said that the committee will report the bill back tomorrow both sides are marshaling their forces and the fight on this bill is evidently going to be the hottest of the session all washington is boiling chapter xliv its easy enough for another fellow to talk said harry despondingly after he had put philip in possession of his view of the case its easy enough to say give her up if you dont care for her what am i going to do to give her up it seemed to harry that it was a situation requiring some active measures he couldnt realize that he had fallen hopelessly in love without some rights accruing to him for the possession of the object of his passion quiet resignation under relinquishment of any thing he wanted was not in his line and when it appeared to him that his surrender of laura would be the withdrawal of the one barrier that kept her from ruin it was unreasonable to expect that he could see how to give her up harry had the most buoyant confidence in his own projects always he saw everything connected with himself in a large way and in rosy lines this predominance of the imagination over the judgment gave that appearance of exaggeration to his conversation and to his communications with regard to himself which sometimes conveyed the impression that he was not speaking the truth his acquaintances had been known to say that they invariably allowed a half for shrinkage in his statements and held the other half under advisement for confirmation philip in this case could not tell from harrys story exactly how much encouragement laura had given him nor what hopes he might justly have of winning her he had never seen him desponding before the brag appeared to be all taken out of him and his airy manner only asserted itself now and then in a comical imitation of its old self philip wanted time to look about him before he decided what to do he was not familiar with washington and it was difficult to adjust his feelings and perceptions to its peculiarities coming out of the sweet sanity of the bolton household this was by contrast the maddest vanity fair one could conceive it seemed to him a feverish unhealthy atmosphere in which lunacy would be easily developed he fancied that everybody attached to himself an exaggerated importance from the fact of being at the national capital the center of political influence the fountain of patronage preferment jobs and opportunities people were introduced to each other as from this or that state not from cities or towns and this gave a largeness to their representative feeling all the women talked politics as naturally and glibly as they talk fashion or literature elsewhere there was always some exciting topic at the capitol or some huge slander was rising up like a miasmatic exhalation from the potomac threatening to settle no one knew exactly where every other person was an aspirant for a place or if he had one for a better place or more pay almost every other one had some claim or interest or remedy to urge even the women were all advocates for the advancement of some person and they violently espoused or denounced this or that measure as it would affect some relative acquaintance or friend love travel even death itself waited on the chances of the dies daily thrown in the two houses and the committee rooms there if the measure went through love could afford to ripen into marriage and longing for foreign travel would have fruition and it must have been only eternal hope springing in the breast that kept alive numerous old claimants who for years and years had besieged the doors of congress and who looked as if they needed not so much an appropriation of money as six feet of ground and those who stood so long waiting for success to bring them death were usually those who had a just claim representing states and talking of national and even international affairs as familiarly as neighbors at home talk of poor crops and the extravagance of their ministers was likely at first to impose upon philip as to the importance of the people gathered here there was a little newspaper editor from phils native town the assistant on a peddletonian weekly who made his little annual joke about the first egg laid on our table and who was the menial of every tradesman in the village and under bonds to him for frequent puffs except the undertaker about whose employment he was recklessly facetious in washington he was an important man correspondent and clerk of two house committees a worker in politics and a confident critic of every woman and every man in washington he would be a consul no doubt by and by at some foreign port of the language of which he was ignorant though if ignorance of language were a qualification he might have been a consul at home his easy familiarity with great men was beautiful to see and when philip learned what a tremendous underground influence this little ignoramus had he no longer wondered at the queer appointments and the queerer legislation philip was not long in discovering that people in washington did not differ much from other people they had the same meannesses generosities and tastes a washington boarding house had the odor of a boarding house the world over col sellers was as unchanged as any one philip saw whom he had known elsewhere washington appeared to be the native element of this man his pretentions were equal to any he encountered there he saw nothing in its society that equalled that of hawkeye he sat down to no table that could not be unfavorably contrasted with his own at home the most airy scheme inflated in the hot air of the capital only reached in magnitude some of his lesser fancies the byplay of his constructive imagination the country is getting along very well he said to philip but our public men are too timid what we want is more money ive told boutwell so talk about basing the currency on gold you might as well base it on pork gold is only one product base it on everything youve got to do something for the west how am i to move my crops we must have improvements grants got the idea we want a canal from the james river to the mississippi government ought to build it it was difficult to get the colonel off from these large themes when he was once started but philip brought the conversation round to laura and her reputation in the city no he said i havent noticed much weve been so busy about this university it will make laura rich with the rest of us and she has done nearly as much as if she were a man she has great talent and will make a big match i see the foreign ministers and that sort after her yes there is talk always will be about a pretty woman so much in public as she is tough stories come to me but i putem away taint likely one of si hawkinss children would do that for she is the same as a child of his i told her though to go slow added the colonel as if that mysterious admonition from him would set everything right do you know anything about a col selby know all about him fine fellow but hes got a wife and i told him as a friend hed better sheer off from laura i reckon he thought better of it and did but philip was not long in learning the truth courted as laura was by a certain class and still admitted into society that nevertheless buzzed with disreputable stories about her she had lost character with the best people her intimacy with selby was open gossip and there were winks and thrustings of the tongue in any group of men when she passed by it was clear enough that harrys delusion must be broken up and that no such feeble obstacle as his passion could interpose would turn laura from her fate philip determined to see her and put himself in possession of the truth as he suspected it in order to show harry his folly laura after her last conversation with harry had a new sense of her position she had noticed before the signs of a change in manner towards her a little less respect perhaps from men and an avoidance by women she had attributed this latter partly to jealousy of her for no one is willing to acknowledge a fault in himself when a more agreeable motive can be found for the estrangement of his acquaintances but now if society had turned on her she would defy it it was not in her nature to shrink she knew she had been wronged and she knew that she had no remedy what she heard of col selbys proposed departure alarmed her more than anything else and she calmly determined that if he was deceiving her the second time it should be the last let society finish the tragedy if it liked she was indifferent what came after at the first opportunity she charged selby with his intention to abandon her he unblushingly denied it he had not thought of going to europe he had only been amusing himself with sellers schemes he swore that as soon as she succeeded with her bill he would fly with her to any part of the world she did not quite believe him for she saw that he feared her and she began to suspect that his were the protestations of a coward to gain time but she showed him no doubts she only watched his movements day by day and always held herself ready to act promptly when philip came into the presence of this attractive woman he could not realize that she was the subject of all the scandal he had heard she received him with quite the old hawkeye openness and cordiality and fell to talking at once of their little acquaintance there and it seemed impossible that he could ever say to her what he had come determined to say such a man as philip has only one standard by which to judge women laura recognized that fact no doubt the better part of her womans nature saw it such a man might years ago not now have changed her nature and made the issue of her life so different even after her cruel abandonment she had a dim feeling of this and she would like now to stand well with him the spark of truth and honor that was left in her was elicited by his presence it was this influence that governed her conduct in this interview i have come said philip in his direct manner from my friend mr brierly you are not ignorant of his feeling towards you perhaps not but perhaps you do not know you who have so much admiration how sincere and overmastering his love is for you philip would not have spoken so plainly if he had in mind anything except to draw from laura something that would end harrys passion and is sincere love so rare mr sterling asked laura moving her foot a little and speaking with a shade of sarcasm perhaps not in washington replied philip tempted into a similar tone excuse my bluntness he continued but would the knowledge of his love would his devotion make any difference to you in your washington life in respect to what asked laura quickly well to others i wont equivocate to col selby lauras face flushed with anger or shame she looked steadily at philip and began by what right sir by the right of friendship interrupted philip stoutly it may matter little to you it is everything to him he has a quixotic notion that you would turn back from what is before you for his sake you cannot be ignorant of what all the city is talking of philip said this determinedly and with some bitterness it was a full minute before laura spoke both had risen philip as if to go and laura in suppressed excitement when she spoke her voice was very unsteady and she looked down yes i know i perfectly understand what you mean mr brierly is nothing simply nothing he is a moth singed that is all the trifler with women thought he was a wasp i have no pity for him not the least you may tell him not to make a fool of himself and to keep away i say this on your account not his you are not like him it is enough for me that you want it so mr sterling she continued looking up and there were tears in her eyes that contradicted the hardness of her language you might not pity him if you knew my history perhaps you would not wonder at some things you hear no it is useless to ask me why it must be so you cant make a life over society wouldnt let you if you would and mine must be lived as it is there sir im not offended but it is useless for you to say anything more philip went away with his heart lightened about harry but profoundly saddened by the glimpse of what this woman might have been he told harry all that was necessary of the conversation she was bent on going her own way he had not the ghost of a chance he was a fool she had said for thinking he had and harry accepted it meekly and made up his own mind that philip didnt know much about women chapter xlv the galleries of the house were packed on the momentous day not because the reporting of an important bill back by a committee was a thing to be excited about if the bill were going to take the ordinary course afterward it would be like getting excited over the empaneling of a coroners jury in a murder case instead of saving up ones emotions for the grander occasion of the hanging of the accused two years later after all the tedious forms of law had been gone through with but suppose you understand that this coroners jury is going to turn out to be a vigilance committee in disguise who will hear testimony for an hour and then hang the murderer on the spot that puts a different aspect upon the matter now it was whispered that the legitimate forms of procedure usual in the house and which keep a bill hanging along for days and even weeks before it is finally passed upon were going to be overruled in this case and short work made of the measure and so what was beginning as a mere inquest might torn out to be something very different in the course of the days business the order of reports of committees was finally reached and when the weary crowds heard that glad announcement issue from the speakers lips they ceased to fret at the dragging delay and plucked up spirit the chairman of the committee on benevolent appropriations rose and made his report and just then a blueuniformed brassmounted little page put a note into his hand it was from senator dilworthy who had appeared upon the floor of the house for a moment and flitted away again everybody expects a grand assault in force no doubt you believe as i certainly do that it is the thing to do we are strong and everything is hot for the contest trollops espousal of our cause has immensely helped us and we grow in power constantly ten of the opposition were called away from town about noonbut so it is said only for one day six others are sick but expect to be about again tomorrow or next day a friend tells me a bold onslaught is worth trying go for a suspension of the rules you will find we can swing a twothirds vote i am perfectly satisfied of it the lords truth will prevail dilworthy mr buckstone had reported the bills from his committee one by one leaving the bill to the last when the house had voted upon the acceptance or rejection of the report upon all but it and the question now being upon its disposal mr buckstone begged that the house would give its attention to a few remarks which he desired to make his committee had instructed him to report the bill favorably he wished to explain the nature of the measure and thus justify the committees action the hostility roused by the press would then disappear and the bill would shine forth in its true and noble character he said that its provisions were simple it incorporated the knobs industrial university locating it in east tennessee declaring it open to all persons without distinction of sex color or religion and committing its management to a board of perpetual trustees with power to fill vacancies in their own number it provided for the erection of certain buildings for the university dormitories lecturehalls museums libraries laboratories workshops furnaces and mills it provided also for the purchase of sixtyfive thousand acres of land fully described for the purposes of the university in the knobs of east tennessee and it appropriated blank dollars for the purchase of the land which should be the property of the national trustees in trust for the uses named every effort had been made to secure the refusal of the whole amount of the property of the hawkins heirs in the knobs some seventyfive thousand acres mr buckstone said but mr washington hawkins one of the heirs objected he was indeed very reluctant to sell any part of the land at any price and indeed this reluctance was justifiable when one considers how constantly and how greatly the property is rising in value what the south needed continued mr buckstone was skilled labor without that it would be unable to develop its mines build its roads work to advantage and without great waste its fruitful land establish manufactures or enter upon a prosperous industrial career its laborers were almost altogether unskilled change them into intelligent trained workmen and you increased at once the capital the resources of the entire south which would enter upon a prosperity hitherto unknown in five years the increase in local wealth would not only reimburse the government for the outlay in this appropriation but pour untold wealth into the treasury this was the material view and the least important in the honorable gentlemans opinion here he referred to some notes furnished him by senator dilworthy and then continued god had given us the care of these colored millions what account should we render to him of our stewardship we had made them free should we leave them ignorant we had cast them upon their own resources should we leave them without tools we could not tell what the intentions of providence are in regard to these peculiar people but our duty was plain the knobs industrial university would be a vast school of modern science and practice worthy of a great nation it would combine the advantages of zurich freiburg creuzot and the sheffield scientific providence had apparently reserved and set apart the knobs of east tennessee for this purpose what else were they for was it not wonderful that for more than thirty years over a generation the choicest portion of them had remained in one family untouched as if separated for some great use it might be asked why the government should buy this land when it had millions of yes more than the railroad companies desired which it might devote to this purpose he answered that the government had no such tract of land as this it had nothing comparable to it for the purposes of the university this was to be a school of mining of engineering of the working of metals of chemistry zoology botany manufactures agriculture in short of all the complicated industries that make a state great there was no place for the location of such a school like the knobs of east tennessee the hills abounded in metals of all sorts iron in all its combinations copper bismuth gold and silver in small quantities platinum he believed tin aluminium it was covered with forests and strange plants in the woods were found the coon the opossum the fox the deer and many other animals who roamed in the domain of natural history coal existed in enormous quantity and no doubt oil it was such a place for the practice of agricultural experiments that any student who had been successful there would have an easy task in any other portion of the country no place offered equal facilities for experiments in mining metallurgy engineering he expected to live to see the day when the youth of the south would resort to its mines its workshops its laboratories its furnaces and factories for practical instruction in all the great industrial pursuits a noisy and rather illnatured debate followed now and lasted hour after hour the friends of the bill were instructed by the leaders to make no effort to check it it was deemed better strategy to tire out the opposition it was decided to vote down every proposition to adjourn and so continue the sitting into the night opponents might desert then one by one and weaken their party for they had no personal stake in the bill sunset came and still the fight went on the gas was lit the crowd in the galleries began to thin but the contest continued the crowd returned by and by with hunger and thirst appeased and aggravated the hungry and thirsty house by looking contented and comfortable but still the wrangle lost nothing of its bitterness recesses were moved plaintively by the opposition and invariably voted down by the university army at midnight the house presented a spectacle calculated to interest a stranger the great galleries were still thronged though only with men now the bright colors that had made them look like hanging gardens were gone with the ladies the reporters gallery was merely occupied by one or two watchful sentinels of the quilldriving guild the main body cared nothing for a debate that had dwindled to a mere vaporing of dull speakers and now and then a brief quarrel over a point of order but there was an unusually large attendance of journalists in the reporters waitingroom chatting smoking and keeping on the qui vive for the general irruption of the congressional volcano that must come when the time was ripe for it senator dilworthy and philip were in the diplomatic gallery washington sat in the public gallery and col sellers was not far away the colonel had been flying about the corridors and buttonholing congressmen all the evening and believed that he had accomplished a world of valuable service but fatigue was telling upon him now and he was quiet and speechless for once below a few senators lounged upon the sofas set apart for visitors and talked with idle congressmen a dreary member was speaking the presiding officer was nodding here and there little knots of members stood in the aisles whispering together all about the house others sat in all the various attitudes that express weariness some tilted back had one or more legs disposed upon their desks some sharpened pencils indolently some scribbled aimlessly some yawned and stretched a great many lay upon their breasts upon the desks sound asleep and gently snoring the flooding gaslight from the fancifully wrought roof poured down upon the tranquil scene hardly a sound disturbed the stillness save the monotonous eloquence of the gentleman who occupied the floor now and then a warrior of the opposition broke down under the pressure gave it up and went home mr buckstone began to think it might be safe now to proceed to business he consulted with trollop and one or two others senator dilworthy descended to the floor of the house and they went to meet him after a brief comparison of notes the congressmen sought their seats and sent pages about the house with messages to friends these latter instantly roused up yawned and began to look alert the moment the floor was unoccupied mr buckstone rose with an injured look and said it was evident that the opponents of the bill were merely talking against time hoping in this unbecoming way to tire out the friends of the measure and so defeat it such conduct might be respectable enough in a village debating society but it was trivial among statesmen it was out of place in so august an assemblage as the house of representatives of the united states the friends of the bill had been not only willing that its opponents should express their opinions but had strongly desired it they courted the fullest and freest discussion but it seemed to him that this fairness was but illy appreciated since gentlemen were capable of taking advantage of it for selfish and unworthy ends this trifling had gone far enough he called for the question the instant mr buckstone sat down the storm burst forth a dozen gentlemen sprang to their feet mr speaker mr speaker mr speaker order order order question question the sharp blows of the speakers gavel rose above the din the previous question that hated gag was moved and carried all debate came to a sudden end of course triumph no then the vote was taken on the adoption of the report and it carried by a surprising majority mr buckstone got the floor again and moved that the rules be suspended and the bill read a first time mr trollop second the motion the speaker it is moved and clamor of voices move we adjourn second the motion adjourn adjourn order order the speaker after using his gavel vigorously it is moved and seconded that the house do now adjourn all those in favor voices division division ayes and nays ayes and nays it was decided to vote upon the adjournment by ayes and nays this was in earnest the excitement was furious the galleries were in commotion in an instant the reporters swarmed to their places idling members of the house flocked to their seats nervous gentlemen sprang to their feet pages flew hither and thither life and animation were visible everywhere all the long ranks of faces in the building were kindled this thing decides it thought mr buckstone but let the fight proceed the voting began and every sound ceased but the calling if the names and the aye no no aye of the responses there was not a movement in the house the people seemed to hold their breath the voting ceased and then there was an interval of dead silence while the clerk made up his count there was a twothirds vote on the university side and two over the speaker the rules are suspended the motion is carried first reading of the bill by one impulse the galleries broke forth into stormy applause and even some of the members of the house were not wholly able to restrain their feelings the speakers gavel came to the rescue and his clear voice followed order gentlemen the house will come to order if spectators offend again the sergeantatarms will clear the galleries then he cast his eyes aloft and gazed at some object attentively for a moment all eyes followed the direction of the speakers and then there was a general titter the speaker said let the sergeantat arms inform the gentleman that his conduct is an infringement of the dignity of the house and one which is not warranted by the state of the weather poor sellers was the culprit he sat in the front seat of the gallery with his arms and his tired body overflowing the balustrade sound asleep dead to all excitements all disturbances the fluctuations of the washington weather had influenced his dreams perhaps for during the recent tempest of applause he had hoisted his gingham umbrella and calmly gone on with his slumbers washington hawkins had seen the act but was not near enough at hand to save his friend and no one who was near enough desired to spoil the effect but a neighbor stirred up the colonel now that the house had its eye upon him and the great speculator furled his tent like the arab he said bless my soul im so absentminded when i get to thinking i never wear an umbrella in the house did anybody notice it whatasleep indeed and did you wake me sir thank you thank you very much indeed it might have fallen out of my hands and been injured admirable article sir present from a friend in hong kong one doesnt come across silk like that in this country its the real young hyson im told by this time the incident was forgotten for the house was at war again victory was almost in sight now and the friends of the bill threw themselves into their work with enthusiasm they soon moved and carried its second reading and after a strong sharp fight carried a motion to go into committee of the whole the speaker left his place of course and a chairman was appointed now the contest raged hotter than ever for the authority that compels order when the house sits as a house is greatly diminished when it sits as committee the main fight came upon the filling of the blanks with the sum to be appropriated for the purchase of the land of course buckstone mr chairman i move you sir that the words three millions of be inserted mr hadley mr chairman i move that the words two and a half dollars be inserted mr clawson mr chairman i move the insertion of the words five and twenty cents as representing the true value of this barren and isolated tract of desolation the question according to rule was taken upon the smallest sum first it was lost then upon the nest smallest sum lost also and then upon the three millions after a vigorous battle that lasted a considerable time this motion was carried then clause by clause the bill was read discussed and amended in trifling particulars and now the committee rose and reported the moment the house had resumed its functions and received the report mr buckstone moved and carried the third reading of the bill the same bitter war over the sum to be paid was fought over again and now that the ayes and nays could be called and placed on record every man was compelled to vote by name on the three millions and indeed on every paragraph of the bill from the enacting clause straight through but as before the friends of the measure stood firm and voted in a solid body every time and so did its enemies the supreme moment was come now but so sure was the result that not even a voice was raised to interpose an adjournment the enemy were totally demoralized the bill was put upon its final passage almost without dissent and the calling of the ayes and nays began when it was ended the triumph was complete the twothirds vote held good and a veto was impossible as far as the house was concerned mr buckstone resolved that now that the nail was driven home he would clinch it on the other side and make it stay forever he moved a reconsideration of the vote by which the bill had passed the motion was lost of course and the great industrial university act was an accomplished fact as far as it was in the power of the house of representatives to make it so there was no need to move an adjournment the instant the last motion was decided the enemies of the university rose and flocked out of the hall talking angrily and its friends flocked after them jubilant and congratulatory the galleries disgorged their burden and presently the house was silent and deserted when col sellers and washington stepped out of the building they were surprised to find that the daylight was old and the sun well up said the colonel give me your hand my boy youre all right at last youre a millionaire at least youre going to be the thing is dead sure dont you bother about the senate leave me and dilworthy to take care of that run along home now and tell laura lord its magnificent news perfectly magnificent run now ill telegraph my wife she must come here and help me build a house everythings all right now washington was so dazed by his good fortune and so bewildered by the gaudy pageant of dreams that was already trailing its long ranks through his brain that he wandered he knew not where and so loitered by the way that when at last he reached home he woke to a sudden annoyance in the fact that his news must be old to laura now for of course senator dilworthy must have already been home and told her an hour before he knocked at her door but there was no answer that is like the duchess said he always cool a body cant excite hercant keep her excited anyway now she has gone off to sleep again as comfortably as if she were used to picking up a million dollars every day or two then he vent to bed but he could not sleep so he got up and wrote a long rapturous letter to louise and another to his mother and he closed both to much the same effect laura will be queen of america now and she will be applauded and honored and petted by the whole nation her name will be in every ones mouth more than ever and how they will court her and quote her bright speeches and mine too i suppose though they do that more already than they really seem to deserve oh the world is so bright now and so cheery the clouds are all gone our long struggle is ended our troubles are all over nothing can ever make us unhappy any more you dear faithful ones will have the reward of your patient waiting now how fathers wisdom is proven at last and how i repent me that there have been times when i lost faith and said the blessing he stored up for us a tedious generation ago was but a longdrawn curse a blight upon us all but everything is well now we are done with poverty sad toil weariness and heartbreak all the world is filled with sunshine chapter xlvi philip left the capitol and walked up pennsylvania avenue in company with senator dilworthy it was a bright spring morning the air was soft and inspiring in the deepening wayside green the pink flush of the blossoming peach trees the soft suffusion on the heights of arlington and the breath of the warm south wind was apparent the annual miracle of the resurrection of the earth the senator took off his hat and seemed to open his soul to the sweet influences of the morning after the heat and noise of the chamber under its dull gasilluminated glass canopy and the all night struggle of passion and feverish excitement there the open tranquil world seemed like heaven the senator was not in an exultant mood but rather in a condition of holy joy befitting a christian statesman whose benevolent plans providence has made its own and stamped with approval the great battle had been fought but the measure had still to encounter the scrutiny of the senate and providence sometimes acts differently in the two houses still the senator was tranquil for he knew that there is an esprit de corps in the senate which does not exist in the house the effect of which is to make the members complaisant towards the projects of each other and to extend a mutual aid which in a more vulgar body would be called logrolling it is under providence a good nights work mr sterling the government has founded an institution which will remove half the difficulty from the southern problem and it is a good thing for the hawkins heirs a very good thing laura will be almost a millionaire do you think mr dilworthy that the hawkinses will get much of the money asked philip innocently remembering the fate of the columbus river appropriation the senator looked at his companion scrutinizingly for a moment to see if he meant any thing personal and then replied undoubtedly undoubtedly i have had their interests greatly at heart there will of course be a few expenses but the widow and orphans will realize all that mr hawkins dreamed of for them the birds were singing as they crossed the presidential square now bright with its green turf and tender foliage after the two had gained the steps of the senators house they stood a moment looking upon the lovely prospect it is like the peace of god said the senator devoutly entering the house the senator called a servant and said tell miss laura that we are waiting to see her i ought to have sent a messenger on horseback half an hour ago he added to philip she will be transported with our victory you must stop to breakfast and see the excitement the servant soon came back with a wondering look and reported miss laura aint dah sah i reckon she haint been dah all night the senator and philip both started up in lauras room there were the marks of a confused and hasty departure drawers half open little articles strewn on the floor the bed had not been disturbed upon inquiry it appeared that laura had not been at dinner excusing herself to mrs dilworthy on the plea of a violent headache that she made a request to the servants that she might not be disturbed the senator was astounded philip thought at once of col selby could laura have run away with him the senator thought not in fact it could not be gen leffenwell the member from new orleans had casually told him at the house last night that selby and his family went to new york yesterday morning and were to sail for europe today philip had another idea which he did not mention he seized his hat and saying that he would go and see what he could learn ran to the lodgings of harry whom he had not seen since yesterday afternoon when he left him to go to the house harry was not in he had gone out with a handbag before six oclock yesterday saying that he had to go to new york but should return next day in harrysroom on the table philip found this note dear mr brierly can you meet me at the six oclock train and be my escort to new york i have to go about this university bill the vote of an absent member we must have here senator dilworthy cannot go yours l h confound it said phillip the noodle has fallen into her trap and she promised she would let him alone he only stopped to send a note to senator dilworthy telling him what he had found and that he should go at once to new york and then hastened to the railway station he had to wait an hour for a train and when it did start it seemed to go at a snails pace philip was devoured with anxiety where could they have gone what was lauras object in taking harry had the flight anything to do with selby would harry be such a fool as to be dragged into some public scandal it seemed as if the train would never reach baltimore then there was a long delay at havre de grace a hot box had to be cooled at wilmington would it never get on only in passing around the city of philadelphia did the train not seem to go slow philip stood upon the platform and watched for the boltons house fancied he could distinguish its roof among the trees and wondered how ruth would feel if she knew he was so near her then came jersey everlasting jersey stupid irritating jersey where the passengers are always asking which line they are on and where they are to come out and whether they have yet reached elizabeth launched into jersey one has a vague notion that he is on many lines and no one in particular and that he is liable at any moment to come to elizabeth he has no notion what elizabeth is and always resolves that the next time he goes that way he will look out of the window and see what it is like but he never does or if he does he probably finds that it is princeton or something of that sort he gets annoyed and never can see the use of having different names for stations in jersey by and by there is newark three or four newarks apparently then marshes then long rock cuttings devoted to the advertisements of patent medicines and readymade clothing and new york tonics for jersey agues and jersey city is reached on the ferryboat philip bought an evening paper from a boy crying eres the evening gram all about the murder and with breathless haste ran his eyes over the following shocking murder tragedy in high life a beautiful woman shoots a distinguished confederate soldier at the southern hotel jealousy the cause this morning occurred another of those shocking murders which have become the almost daily food of the newspapers the direct result of the socialistic doctrines and womans rights agitations which have made every woman the avenger of her own wrongs and all society the hunting ground for her victims about nine oclock a lady deliberately shot a man dead in the public parlor of the southern hotel coolly remarking as she threw down her revolver and permitted herself to be taken into custody he brought it on himself our reporters were immediately dispatched to the scene of the tragedy and gathered the following particulars yesterday afternoon arrived at the hotel from washington col george selby and family who had taken passage and were to sail at noon today in the steamer scotia for england the colonel was a handsome man about forty a gentleman of wealth and high social position a resident of new orleans he served with distinction in the confederate army and received a wound in the leg from which he has never entirely recovered being obliged to use a cane in locomotion this morning at about nine oclock a lady accompanied by a gentleman called at the office of the hotel and asked for col selby the colonel was at breakfast would the clerk tell him that a lady and gentleman wished to see him for a moment in the parlor the clerk says that the gentleman asked her what do you want to see him for and that she replied he is going to europe and i ought to just say good by col selby was informed and the lady and gentleman were shown to the parlor in which were at the time three or four other persons five minutes after two shots were fired in quick succession and there was a rush to the parlor from which the reports came col selby was found lying on the floor bleeding but not dead two gentlemen who had just come in had seized the lady who made no resistance and she was at once given in charge of a police officer who arrived the persons who were in the parlor agree substantially as to what occurred they had happened to be looking towards the door when the man col selby entered with his cane and they looked at him because he stopped as if surprised and frightened and made a backward movement at the same moment the lady in the bonnet advanced towards him and said something like george will you go with me he replied throwing up his hand and retreating my god i cant dont fire and the next instants two shots were heard and he fell the lady appeared to be beside herself with rage or excitement and trembled very much when the gentlemen took hold of her it was to them she said he brought it on himself col selby was carried at once to his room and dr puffer the eminent surgeon was sent for it was found that he was shot through the breast and through the abdomen other aid was summoned but the wounds were mortal and col selby expired in an hour in pain but his mind was clear to the last and he made a full deposition the substance of it was that his murderess is a miss laura hawkins whom he had known at washington as a lobbyist and had some business with her she had followed him with her attentions and solicitations and had endeavored to make him desert his wife and go to europe with her when he resisted and avoided her she had threatened him only the day before he left washington she had declared that he should never go out of the city alive without her it seems to have been a deliberate and premeditated murder the woman following him to washington on purpose to commit it we learn that the murderess who is a woman of dazzling and transcendent beauty and about twenty six or seven is a niece of senator dilworthy at whose house she has been spending the winter she belongs to a high southern family and has the reputation of being an heiress like some other great beauties and belles in washington however there have been whispers that she had something to do with the lobby if we mistake not we have heard her name mentioned in connection with the sale of the tennessee lands to the knobs university the bill for which passed the house last night her companion is mr harry brierly a new york dandy who has been in washington his connection with her and with this tragedy is not known but he was also taken into custody and will be detained at least as a witness p s one of the persons present in the parlor says that after laura hawkins had fired twice she turned the pistol towards herself but that brierly sprung and caught it from her hand and that it was he who threw it on the floor further particulars with full biographies of all the parties in our next edition philip hastened at once to the southern hotel where he found still a great state of excitement and a thousand different and exaggerated stories passing from mouth to mouth the witnesses of the event had told it over so many time that they had worked it up into a most dramatic scene and embellished it with whatever could heighten its awfulness outsiders had taken up invention also the colonels wife had gone insane they said the children had rushed into the parlor and rolled themselves in their fathers blood the hotel clerk said that he noticed there was murder in the womans eye when he saw her a person who had met the woman on the stairs felt a creeping sensation some thought brierly was an accomplice and that he had set the woman on to kill his rival some said the woman showed the calmness and indifference of insanity philip learned that harry and laura had both been taken to the city prison and he went there but he was not admitted not being a newspaper reporter he could not see either of them that night but the officer questioned him suspiciously and asked him who he was he might perhaps see brierly in the morning the latest editions of the evening papers had the result of the inquest it was a plain enough case for the jury but they sat over it a long time listening to the wrangling of the physicians dr puffer insisted that the man died from the effects of the wound in the chest dr dobb as strongly insisted that the wound in the abdomen caused death dr golightly suggested that in his opinion death ensued from a complication of the two wounds and perhaps other causes he examined the table waiter as to whether col selby ate any breakfast and what he ate and if he had any appetite the jury finally threw themselves back upon the indisputable fact that selby was dead that either wound would have killed him admitted by the doctors and rendered a verdict that he died from pistolshot wounds inflicted by a pistol in the hands of laura hawkins the morning papers blazed with big type and overflowed with details of the murder the accounts in the evening papers were only the premonitory drops to this mighty shower the scene was dramatically worked up in column after column there were sketches biographical and historical there were long specials from washington giving a full history of lauras career there with the names of men with whom she was said to be intimate a description of senator dilworthys residence and of his family and of lauras room in his house and a sketch of the senators appearance and what he said there was a great deal about her beauty her accomplishments and her brilliant position in society and her doubtful position in society there was also an interview with col sellers and another with washington hawkins the brother of the murderess one journal had a long dispatch from hawkeye reporting the excitement in that quiet village and the reception of the awful intelligence all the parties had been interviewed there were reports of conversations with the clerk at the hotel with the callboy with the waiter at table with all the witnesses with the policeman with the landlord who wanted it understood that nothing of that sort had ever happened in his house before although it had always been frequented by the best southern society and with mrs col selby there were diagrams illustrating the scene of the shooting and views of the hotel and street and portraits of the parties there were three minute and different statements from the doctors about the wounds so technically worded that nobody could understand them harry and laura had also been interviewed and there was a statement from philip himself which a reporter had knocked him up out of bed at midnight to give though how he found him philip never could conjecture what some of the journals lacked in suitable length for the occasion they made up in encyclopaedic information about other similar murders and shootings the statement from laura was not full in fact it was fragmentary and consisted of nine parts of the reporters valuable observations to one of lauras and it was as the reporter significantly remarked incoherent but it appeared that laura claimed to be selbys wife or to have been his wife that he had deserted her and betrayed her and that she was going to follow him to europe when the reporter asked what made you shoot him miss hawkins lauras only reply was very simply did i shoot him do they say i shot him and she would say no more the news of the murder was made the excitement of the day talk of it filled the town the facts reported were scrutinized the standing of the parties was discussed the dozen different theories of the motive broached in the newspapers were disputed over during the night subtle electricity had carried the tale over all the wires of the continent and under the sea and in all villages and towns of the union from the atlantic to the territories and away up and down the pacific slope and as far as london and paris and berlin that morning the name of laura hawkins was spoken by millions and millions of people while the owner of it the sweet child of years ago the beautiful queen of washington drawing rooms sat shivering on her cotbed in the darkness of a damp cell in the tombs chapter xlvii philips first effort was to get harry out of the tombs he gained permission to see him in the presence of an officer during the day and he found that hero very much cast down i never intended to come to such a place as this old fellow he said to philip its no place for a gentleman theyve no idea how to treat a gentleman look at that provender pointing to his uneaten prison ration they tell me i am detained as a witness and i passed the night among a lot of cutthroats and dirty rascals a pretty witness id be in a month spent in such company but what under heavens asked philip induced you to come to new york with laura what was it for what for why she wanted me to come i didnt know anything about that cursed selby she said it was lobby business for the university id no idea what she was dragging me into that confounded hotel for i suppose she knew that the southerners all go there and thought shed find her man oh lord i wish id taken your advice you might as well murder somebody and have the credit of it as get into the newspapers the way i have shes pure devil that girl you ought to have seen how sweet she was on me what an ass i am well im not going to dispute a poor prisoner but the first thing is to get you out of this ive brought the note laura wrote you for one thing and ive seen your uncle and explained the truth of the case to him he will be here soon harrys uncle came with other friends and in the course of the day made such a showing to the authorities that harry was released on giving bonds to appear as a witness when wanted his spirits rose with their usual elasticity as soon as he was out of centre street and he insisted on giving philip and his friends a royal supper at delmonicos an excess which was perhaps excusable in the rebound of his feelings and which was committed with his usual reckless generosity harry ordered the supper and it is perhaps needless to say that philip paid the bill neither of the young men felt like attempting to see laura that day and she saw no company except the newspaper reporters until the arrival of col sellers and washington hawkins who had hastened to new york with all speed they found laura in a cell in the upper tier of the womens department the cell was somewhat larger than those in the mens department and might be eight feet by ten square perhaps a little longer it was of stone floor and all and tile roof was oven shaped a narrow slit in the roof admitted sufficient light and was the only means of ventilation when the window was opened there was nothing to prevent the rain coming in the only means of heating being from the corridor when the door was ajar the cell was chilly and at this time damp it was whitewashed and clean but it had a slight jail odor its only furniture was a narrow iron bedstead with a tick of straw and some blankets not too clean when col sellers was conducted to this cell by the matron and looked in his emotions quite overcame him the tears rolled down his cheeks and his voice trembled so that he could hardly speak washington was unable to say anything he looked from laura to the miserable creatures who were walking in the corridor with unutterable disgust laura was alone calm and selfcontained though she was not unmoved by the sight of the grief of her friends are you comfortable laura was the first word the colonel could get out you see she replied i cant say its exactly comfortable are you cold it is pretty chilly the stone floor is like ice it chills me through to step on it i have to sit on the bed poor thing poor thing and can you eat any thing no i am not hungry i dont know that i could eat any thing i cant eat that oh dear continued the colonel its dreadful but cheer up dear cheer up and the colonel broke down entirely but he went on well stand by you well do everything for you i know you couldnt have meant to do it it must have been insanity you know or something of that sort you never did anything of the sort before laura smiled very faintly and said yes it was something of that sort its all a whirl he was a villain you dont know id rather have killed him myself in a duel you know all fair i wish i had but dont you be down well get you the best counsel the lawyers in new york can do anything ive read of cases but you must be comfortable now weve brought some of your clothes at the hotel what else can we get for you laura suggested that she would like some sheets for her bed a piece of carpet to step on and her meals sent in and some books and writing materials if it was allowed the colonel and washington promised to procure all these things and then took their sorrowful leave a great deal more affected than the criminal was apparently by her situation the colonel told the matron as he went away that if she would look to lauras comfort a little it shouldnt be the worse for her and to the turnkey who let them out he patronizingly said youve got a big establishment here a credit to the city ive got a friend in there i shall see you again sir by the next day something more of lauras own story began to appear in the newspapers colored and heightened by reporters rhetoric some of them cast a lurid light upon the colonels career and represented his victim as a beautiful avenger of her murdered innocence and others pictured her as his willing paramour and pitiless slayer her communications to the reporters were stopped by her lawyers as soon as they were retained and visited her but this fact did not prevent it may have facilitated the appearance of casual paragraphs here and there which were likely to beget popular sympathy for the poor girl the occasion did not pass without improvement by the leading journals and philip preserved the editorial comments of three or four of them which pleased him most these he used to read aloud to his friends afterwards and ask them to guess from which journal each of them had been cut one began in this simple manner history never repeats itself but the kaleidoscopic combinations of the pictured present often seem to be constructed out of the broken fragments of antique legends washington is not corinth and lais the beautiful daughter of timandra might not have been the prototype of the ravishing laura daughter of the plebeian house of hawkins but the orators add statesmen who were the purchasers of the favors of the one may have been as incorruptible as the republican statesmen who learned how to love and how to vote from the sweet lips of the washington lobbyist and perhaps the modern lais would never have departed from the national capital if there had been there even one republican xenocrates who resisted her blandishments but here the parallel fails lais wandering away with the youth rippostratus is slain by the women who are jealous of her charms laura straying into her thessaly with the youth brierly slays her other lover and becomes the champion of the wrongs of her sex another journal began its editorial with less lyrical beauty but with equal force it closed as follows with laura hawkins fair fascinating and fatal and with the dissolute colonel of a lost cause who has reaped the harvest he sowed we have nothing to do but as the curtain rises on this awful tragedy we catch a glimpse of the society at the capital under this administration which we cannot contemplate without alarm for the fate of the republic a third newspaper took up the subject in a different tone it said our repeated predictions are verified the pernicious doctrines which we have announced as prevailing in american society have been again illustrated the name of the city is becoming a reproach we may have done something in averting its ruin in our resolute exposure of the great frauds we shall not be deterred from insisting that the outraged laws for the protection of human life shall be vindicated now so that a person can walk the streets or enter the public houses at least in the daytime without the risk of a bullet through his brain a fourth journal began its remarks as follows the fullness with which we present our readers this morning the details of the selbyhawkins homicide is a miracle of modern journalism subsequent investigation can do little to fill out the picture it is the old story a beautiful woman shoots her absconding lover in coldblood and we shall doubtless learn in due time that if she was not as mad as a hare in this month of march she was at least laboring under what is termed momentary insanity it would not be too much to say that upon the first publication of the facts of the tragedy there was an almost universal feeling of rage against the murderess in the tombs and that reports of her beauty only heightened the indignation it was as if she presumed upon that and upon her sex to defy the law and there was a fervent hope that the law would take its plain course yet laura was not without friends and some of them very influential too she had in keeping a great many secrets and a great many reputations perhaps who shall set himself up to judge human motives why indeed might we not feel pity for a woman whose brilliant career had been so suddenly extinguished in misfortune and crime those who had known her so well in washington might find it impossible to believe that the fascinating woman could have had murder in her heart and would readily give ear to the current sentimentality about the temporary aberration of mind under the stress of personal calamity senator dilworthy was greatly shocked of course but he was full of charity for the erring we shall all need mercy he said laura as an inmate of my family was a most exemplary female amiable affectionate and truthful perhaps too fond of gaiety and neglectful of the externals of religion but a woman of principle she may have had experiences of which i am ignorant but she could not have gone to this extremity if she had been in her own right mind to the senators credit be it said he was willing to help laura and her family in this dreadful trial she herself was not without money for the washington lobbyist is not seldom more fortunate than the washington claimant and she was able to procure a good many luxuries to mitigate the severity of her prison life it enabled her also to have her own family near her and to see some of them daily the tender solicitude of her mother her childlike grief and her firm belief in the real guiltlessness of her daughter touched even the custodians of the tombs who are enured to scenes of pathos mrs hawkins had hastened to her daughter as soon as she received money for the journey she had no reproaches she had only tenderness and pity she could not shut out the dreadful facts of the case but it had been enough for her that laura had said in their first interview mother i did not know what i was doing she obtained lodgings near the prison and devoted her life to her daughter as if she had been really her own child she would have remained in the prison day and night if it had been permitted she was aged and feeble but this great necessity seemed to give her new life the pathetic story of the old ladys ministrations and her simplicity and faith also got into the newspapers in time and probably added to the pathos of this wrecked womans fate which was beginning to be felt by the public it was certain that she had champions who thought that her wrongs ought to be placed against her crime and expressions of this feeling came to her in various ways visitors came to see her and gifts of fruit and flowers were sent which brought some cheer into her hard and gloomy cell laura had declined to see either philip or harry somewhat to the formers relief who had a notion that she would necessarily feel humiliated by seeing him after breaking faith with him but to the discomfiture of harry who still felt her fascination and thought her refusal heartless he told philip that of course he had got through with such a woman but he wanted to see her philip to keep him from some new foolishness persuaded him to go with him to philadelphia and give his valuable services in the mining operations at ilium the law took its course with laura she was indicted for murder in the first degree and held for trial at the summer term the two most distinguished criminal lawyers in the city had been retained for her defence and to that the resolute woman devoted her days with a courage that rose as she consulted with her counsel and understood the methods of criminal procedure in new york she was greatly depressed however by the news from washington congress adjourned and her bill had failed to pass the senate it must wait for the next session chapter xlviii it had been a bad winter somehow for the firm of pennybacker bigler and small these celebrated contractors usually made more money during the session of the legislature at harrisburg than upon all their summer work and this winter had been unfruitful it was unaccountable to bigler you see mr bolton he said and philip was present at the conversation it puts us all out it looks as if politics was played out wed counted on the year of simons reelection and now hes reelected and ive yet to see the first man whos the better for it you dont mean to say asked philip that he went in without paying anything not a cent not a dash cent as i can hear repeated mr bigler indignantly i call it a swindle on the state how it was done gets me i never saw such a tight time for money in harrisburg were there no combinations no railroad jobs no mining schemes put through in connection with the election not that i knew said bigler shaking his head in disgust in fact it was openly said that there was no money in the election its perfectly unheard of perhaps suggested philip it was effected on what the insurance companies call the endowment or the paid up plan by which a policy is secured after a certain time without further payment you think then said mr bolton smiling that a liberal and sagacious politician might own a legislature after a time and not be bothered with keeping up his payments whatever it is interrupted mr bigler its devilish ingenious and goes ahead of my calculations its cleaned me out when i thought we had a dead sure thing i tell you what it is gentlemen i shall go in for reform things have got pretty mixed when a legislature will give away a united states senatorship it was melancholy but mr bigler was not a man to be crushed by one misfortune or to lose his confidence in human nature on one exhibition of apparent honesty he was already on his feet again or would be if mr bolton could tide him over shoal water for ninety days weve got something with money in it he explained to mr bolton got hold of it by good luck weve got the entire contract for dobsons patent pavement for the city of mobile see here mr bigler made some figures contract so much cost of work and materials so much profits so much at the end of three months the city would owe the company three hundred and seventyfive thousand dollarstwo hundred thousand of that would be profits the whole job was worth at least a million to the company it might be more there could be no mistake in these figures here was the contract mr bolton knew what materials were worth and what the labor would cost mr bolton knew perfectly well from sore experience that there was always a mistake in figures when bigler or small made them and he knew that he ought to send the fellow about his business instead of that he let him talk they only wanted to raise fifty thousand dollars to carry on the contract that expended they would have city bonds mr bolton said he hadnt the money but bigler could raise it on his name mr bolton said he had no right to put his family to that risk but the entire contract could be assigned to him the security was ample it was a fortune to him if it was forfeited besides mr bigler had been unfortunate he didnt know where to look for the necessaries of life for his family if he could only have one more chance he was sure he could right himself he begged for it and mr bolton yielded he could never refuse such appeals if he had befriended a man once and been cheated by him that man appeared to have a claim upon him forever he shrank however from telling his wife what he had done on this occasion for he knew that if any person was more odious than small to his family it was bigler philip tells me mrs bolton said that evening that the man bigler has been with thee again today i hope thee will have nothing more to do with him he has been very unfortunate replied mr bolton uneasily he is always unfortunate and he is always getting thee into trouble but thee didnt listen to him again well mother his family is in want and i lent him my name but i took ample security the worst that can happen will be a little inconvenience mrs bolton looked grave and anxious but she did not complain or remonstrate she knew what a little inconvenience meant but she knew there was no help for it if mr bolton had been on his way to market to buy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in his pocket he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for it mrs bolton only asked and the question showed that she was no mere provident than her husband where her heart was interested but has thee provided money for philip to use in opening the coal mine yes i have set apart as much as it ought to cost to open the mine as much as we can afford to lose if no coal is found philip has the control of it as equal partner in the venture deducting the capital invested he has great confidence in his success and i hope for his sake he wont be disappointed philip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the boltonfamily by all except ruth his mother when he went home after his recovery from his accident had affected to be very jealous of mrs bolton about whom and ruth she asked a thousand questions an affectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache which comes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and forms new ties and to mrs sterling a widow living on a small income in a remote massachusetts village philadelphia was a city of many splendors all its inhabitants seemed highly favored dwelling in ease and surrounded by superior advantages some of her neighbors had relations living in philadelphia and it seemed to them somehow a guarantee of respectability to have relations in philadelphia mrs sterling was not sorry to have philip make his way among such welltodo people and she was sure that no good fortune could be too good for his deserts so sir said ruth when philip came from new york you have been assisting in a pretty tragedy i saw your name in the papers is this woman a specimen of your western friends my only assistance replied philip a little annoyed was in trying to keep harry out of a bad scrape and i failed after all he walked into her trap and he has been punished for it im going to take him up to ilium to see if he wont work steadily at one thing and quit his nonsense is she as beautiful as the newspapers say she is i dont know she has a kind of beauty she is not like not like alice well she is brilliant she was called the handsomest woman in washington dashing you know and sarcastic and witty ruth do you believe a woman ever becomes a devil men do and i dont know why women shouldnt but i never saw one well laura hawkins comes very near it but it is dreadful to think of her fate why do you suppose they will hang a woman do you suppose they will be so barbarous as that i wasnt thinking of that its doubtful if a new york jury would find a woman guilty of any such crime but to think of her life if she is acquitted it is dreadful said ruth thoughtfully but the worst of it is that you men do not want women educated to do anything to be able to earn an honest living by their own exertions they are educated as if they were always to be petted and supported and there was never to be any such thing as misfortune i suppose now that you would all choose to have me stay idly at home and give up my profession oh no said philip earnestly i respect your resolution but ruth do you think you would be happier or do more good in following your profession than in having a home of your own what is to hinder having a home of my own nothing perhaps only you never would be in it you would be away day and night if you had any practice and what sort of a home would that make for your husband what sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away riding about in his doctors gig ah you know that is not fair the woman makes the home philip and ruth often had this sort of discussion to which philip was always trying to give a personal turn he was now about to go to ilium for the season and he did not like to go without some assurance from ruth that she might perhaps love him some day when he was worthy of it and when he could offer her something better than a partnership in his poverty i should work with a great deal better heart ruth he said the morning he was taking leave if i knew you cared for me a little ruth was looking down the color came faintly to her cheeks and she hesitated she neednt be looking down he thought for she was ever so much shorter than tall philip its not much of a place ilium philip went on as if a little geographical remark would fit in here as well as anything else and i shall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility i have taken and his observation did not seem to be coming out any where but ruth looked up and there was a light in her eyes that quickened phils pulse she took his hand and said with serious sweetness thee mustnt lose heart philip and then she added in another mood thee knows i graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma and if any thing happens mines explode sometimes thee can send for me farewell the opening of the ilium coal mine was begun with energy but without many omens of success philip was running a tunnel into the breast of the mountain in faith that the coal stratum ran there as it ought to how far he must go in he believed he knew but no one could tell exactly some of the miners said that they should probably go through the mountain and that the hole could be used for a railway tunnel the mining camp was a busy place at any rate quite a settlement of board and log shanties had gone up with a blacksmith shop a small machine shop and a temporary store for supplying the wants of the workmen philip and harry pitched a commodious tent and lived in the full enjoyment of the free life there is no difficulty in digging a bole in the ground if you have money enough to pay for the digging but those who try this sort of work are always surprised at the large amount of money necessary to make a small hole the earth is never willing to yield one product hidden in her bosom without an equivalent for it and when a person asks of her coal she is quite apt to require gold in exchange it was exciting work for all concerned in it as the tunnel advanced into the rock every day promised to be the golden day this very blast might disclose the treasure the work went on week after week and at length during the night as well as the daytime gangs relieved each other and the tunnel was every hour inch by inch and foot by foot crawling into the mountain philip was on the stretch of hope and excitement every pay day he saw his funds melting away and still there was only the faintest show of what the miners call signs the life suited harry whose buoyant hopefulness was never disturbed he made endless calculations which nobody could understand of the probable position of the vein he stood about among the workmen with the busiest air when he was down at ilium he called himself the engineer of the works and he used to spend hours smoking his pipe with the dutch landlord on the hotel porch and astonishing the idlers there with the stories of his railroad operations in missouri he talked with the landlord too about enlarging his hotel and about buying some village lots in the prospect of a rise when the mine was opened he taught the dutchman how to mix a great many cooling drinks for the summer time and had a bill at the hotel the growing length of which mr dusenheimer contemplated with pleasant anticipations mr brierly was a very useful and cheering person wherever he went midsummer arrived philip could report to mr bolton only progress and this was not a cheerful message for him to send to philadelphia in reply to inquiries that he thought became more and more anxious philip himself was a prey to the constant fear that the money would give out before the coal was struck at this time harry was summoned to new york to attend the trial of laura hawkins it was possible that philip would have to go also her lawyer wrote but they hoped for a postponement there was important evidence that they could not yet obtain and he hoped the judge would not force them to a trial unprepared there were many reasons for a delay reasons which of course are never mentioned but which it would seem that a new york judge sometimes must understand when he grants a postponement upon a motion that seems to the public altogether inadequate harry went but he soon came back the trial was put off every week we can gain said the learned counsel braham improves our chances the popular rage never lasts long chapter xlix weve struck it this was the announcement at the tent door that woke philip out of a sound sleep at dead of night and shook all the sleepiness out of him in a trice what where is it when coal let me see it what quality is it were some of the rapid questions that philip poured out as he hurriedly dressed harry wake up my boy the coal train is coming struck it eh lets see the foreman put down his lantern and handed philip a black lump there was no mistake about it it was the hard shining anthracite and its freshly fractured surface glistened in the light like polished steel diamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of philip harry was exuberant but philips natural caution found expression in his next remark now roberts you are sure about this what sure that its coal o no sure that its the main vein well yes we took it to be that did you from the first i cant say we did at first no we didnt most of the indications were there but not all of them not all of them so we thought wed prospect a bit well it was tolerable thick and looked as if it might be the vein looked as if it ought to be the vein then we went down on it a little looked better all the time when did you strike it about ten oclock then youve been prospecting about four hours yes been sinking on it something over four hours im afraid you couldnt go down very far in four hours could you o yes its a good deal broke up nothing but picking and gadding stuff well it does look encouraging sure enough but then the lacking indications id rather we had them mr sterling but ive seen more than one good permanent mine struck without em in my time well that is encouraging too yes there was the union the alabama and the black mohawk all good sound mines you know all just exactly like this one when we first struck them well i begin to feel a good deal more easy i guess weve really got it i remember hearing them tell about the black mohawk im free to say that i believe it and the men all think so too they are all old hands at this business come harry lets go up and look at it just for the comfort of it said philip they came back in the course of an hour satisfied and happy there was no more sleep for them that night they lit their pipes put a specimen of the coal on the table and made it a kind of loadstone of thought and conversation of course said harry there will have to be a branch track built and a switchback up the hill yes there will be no trouble about getting the money for that now we could sellout tomorrow for a handsome sum that sort of coal doesnt go begging within a mile of a railroad i wonder if mr bolton would rather sell out or work it oh work it says harry probably the whole mountain is coal now youve got to it possibly it might not be much of a vein after all suggested philip possibly it is ill bet its forty feet thick i told you i knew the sort of thing as soon as i put my eyes on it philips next thought was to write to his friends and announce their good fortune to mr bolton he wrote a short business letter as calm as he could make it they had found coal of excellent quality but they could not yet tell with absolute certainty what the vein was the prospecting was still going on philip also wrote to ruth but though this letter may have glowed it was not with the heat of burning anthracite he needed no artificial heat to warm his pen and kindle his ardor when he sat down to write to ruth but it must be confessed that the words never flowed so easily before and he ran on for an hour disporting in all the extravagance of his imagination when ruth read it she doubted if the fellow had not gone out of his senses and it was not until she reached the postscript that she discovered the cause of the exhilaration p s we have found coal the news couldnt have come to mr bolton in better time he had never been so sorely pressed a dozen schemes which he had in hand any one of which might turn up a fortune all languished and each needed just a little more money to save that which had been invested he hadnt a piece of real estate that was not covered with mortgages even to the wild tract which philip was experimenting on and which had no marketable value above the incumbrance on it he had come home that day early unusually dejected i am afraid he said to his wife that we shall have to give up our house i dont care for myself but for thee and the children that will be the least of misfortunes said mrs bolton cheerfully if thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety which is wearing thee out we can live any where thee knows we were never happier than when we were in a much humbler home the truth is margaret that affair of bigler and smalls has come on me just when i couldnt stand another ounce they have made another failure of it i might have known they would and the sharpers or fools i dont know which have contrived to involve me for three times as much as the first obligation the security is in my hands but it is good for nothing to me i have not the money to do anything with the contract ruth heard this dismal news without great surprise she had long felt that they were living on a volcano that might go in to active operation at any hour inheriting from her father an active brain and the courage to undertake new things she had little of his sanguine temperament which blinds one to difficulties and possible failures she had little confidence in the many schemes which had been about to lift her father out of all his embarrassments and into great wealth ever since she was a child as she grew older she rather wondered that they were as prosperous as they seemed to be and that they did not all go to smash amid so many brilliant projects she was nothing but a woman and did not know how much of the business prosperity of the world is only a bubble of credit and speculation one scheme helping to float another which is no better than it and the whole liable to come to naught and confusion as soon as the busy brain that conceived them ceases its power to devise or when some accident produces a sudden panic perhaps i shall be the stay of the family yet said ruth with an approach to gaiety when we move into a little house in town will thee let me put a little sign on the door dr ruth bolton mrs dr longstreet thee knows has a great income who will pay for the sign ruth asked mr bolton a servant entered with the afternoon mail from the office mr bolton took his letters listlessly dreading to open them he knew well what they contained new difficulties more urgent demands fox money oh here is one from philip poor fellow i shall feel his disappointment as much as my own bad luck it is hard to bear when one is young he opened the letter and read as he read his face lightened and he fetched such a sigh of relief that mrs bolton and ruth both exclaimed read that he cried philip has found coal the world was changed in a moment one little sentence had done it there was no more trouble philip had found coal that meant relief that meant fortune a great weight was taken off and the spirits of the whole household rose magically good money beautiful demon of money what an enchanter thou art ruth felt that she was of less consequence in the household now that philip had found coal and perhaps she was not sorry to feel so mr bolton was ten years younger the next morning he went into the city and showed his letter on change it was the sort of news his friends were quite willing to listen to they took a new interest in him if it was confirmed bolton would come right up again there would be no difficulty about his getting all the money he wanted the money market did not seem to be half so tight as it was the day before mr bolton spent a very pleasant day in his office and went home revolving some new plans and the execution of some projects he had long been prevented from entering upon by the lack of money the day had been spent by philip in no less excitement by daylight with philips letters to the mail word had gone down to ilium that coal had been found and very early a crowd of eager spectators had come up to see for themselves the prospecting continued day and night for upwards of a week and during the first four or five days the indications grew more and more promising and the telegrams and letters kept mr bolton duly posted but at last a change came and the promises began to fail with alarming rapidity in the end it was demonstrated without the possibility of a doubt that the great find was nothing but a worthless seam philip was cast down all the more so because he had been so foolish as to send the news to philadelphia before he knew what he was writing about and now he must contradict it it turns out to be only a mere seam he wrote but we look upon it as an indication of better further in alas mr boltons affairs could not wait for indications the future might have a great deal in store but the present was black and hopeless it was doubtful if any sacrifice could save him from ruin yet sacrifice he must make and that instantly in the hope of saving something from the wreck of his fortune his lovely country home must go that would bring the most ready money the house that he had built with loving thought for each one of his family as he planned its luxurious apartments and adorned it the grounds that he had laid out with so much delight in following the tastes of his wife with whom the country the cultivation of rare trees and flowers the care of garden and lawn and conservatories were a passion almost this home which he had hoped his children would enjoy long after he had done with it must go the family bore the sacrifice better than he did they declared in fact women are such hypocrites that they quite enjoyed the city it was in august after living so long in the country that it was a thousand tunes more convenient in every respect mrs bolton said it was a relief from the worry of a large establishment and ruth reminded her father that she should have had to come to town anyway before long mr bolton was relieved exactly as a waterlogged ship is lightened by throwing overboard the most valuable portion of the cargo but the leak was not stopped indeed his credit was injured instead of helped by the prudent step be had taken it was regarded as a sure evidence of his embarrassment and it was much more difficult for him to obtain help than if he had instead of retrenching launched into some new speculation philip was greatly troubled and exaggerated his own share in the bringing about of the calamity you must not look at it so mr bolton wrote him you have neither helped nor hindered but you know you may help by and by it would have all happened just so if we had never begun to dig that hole that is only a drop work away i still have hope that something will occur to relieve me at any rate we must not give up the mine so long as we have any show alas the relief did not come new misfortunes came instead when the extent of the bigler swindle was disclosed there was no more hope that mr bolton could extricate himself and he had as an honest man no resource except to surrender all his property for the benefit of his creditors the autumn came and found philip working with diminished force but still with hope he had again and again been encouraged by good indications but he had again and again been disappointed he could not go on much longer and almost everybody except himself had thought it was useless to go on as long as he had been doing when the news came of mr boltons failure of course the work stopped the men were discharged the tools were housed the hopeful noise of pickman and driver ceased and the mining camp had that desolate and mournful aspect which always hovers over a frustrated enterprise philip sat down amid the ruins and almost wished he were buried in them how distant ruth was now from him now when she might need him most how changed was all the philadelphia world which had hitherto stood for the exemplification of happiness and prosperity he still had faith that there was coal in that mountain he made a picture of himself living there a hermit in a shanty by the tunnel digging away with solitary pick and wheelbarrow day after day and year after year until he grew gray and aged and was known in all that region as the old man of the mountain perhaps some day he felt it must be so some day he should strike coal but what if he did who would be alive to care for it then what would he care for it then no a man wants riches in his youth when the world is fresh to him he wondered why providence could not have reversed the usual process and let the majority of men begin with wealth and gradually spend it and die poor when they no longer needed it harry went back to the city it was evident that his services were no longer needed indeed he had letters from his uncle which he did not read to philip desiring him to go to san francisco to look after some government contracts in the harbor there philip had to look about him for something to do he was like adam the world was all before him whereto choose he made before he went elsewhere a somewhat painful visit to philadelphia painful but yet not without its sweetnesses the family had never shown him so much affection before they all seemed to think his disappointment of more importance than their own misfortune and there was that in ruths manner in what she gave him and what she withheld that would have made a hero of a very much less promising character than philip sterling among the assets of the bolton property the ilium tract was sold and philip bought it in at the vendue for a song for no one cared to even undertake the mortgage on it except himself he went away the owner of it and had ample time before he reached home in november to calculate how much poorer he was by possessing it chapter l it is impossible for the historian with even the best intentions to control events or compel the persons of his narrative to act wisely or to be successful it is easy to see how things might have been better managed a very little change here and there would have made a very different history of this one now in hand if philip had adopted some regular profession even some trade he might now be a prosperous editor or a conscientious plumber or an honest lawyer and have borrowed money at the savings bank and built a cottage and be now furnishing it for the occupancy of ruth and himself instead of this with only a smattering of civil engineering he is at his mothers house fretting and fuming over his illluck and the hardness and dishonesty of men and thinking of nothing but how to get the coal out of the ilium hills if senator dilworthy had not made that visit to hawkeye the hawkins family and col sellers would not now be dancing attendance upon congress and endeavoring to tempt that immaculate body into one of those appropriations for the benefit of its members which the members find it so difficult to explain to their constituents and laura would not be lying in the tombs awaiting her trial for murder and doing her best by the help of able counsel to corrupt the pure fountain of criminal procedure in new york if henry brierly had been blown up on the first mississippi steamboat he set foot on as the chances were that he would be he and col sellers never would have gone into the columbus navigation scheme and probably never into the east tennessee land scheme and he would not now be detained in new york from very important business operations on the pacific coast for the sole purpose of giving evidence to convict of murder the only woman he ever loved half as much as he loves himself if mr bolton had said the little word no to mr bigler alice montague might now be spending the winter in philadelphia and philip also waiting to resume his mining operations in the spring and ruth would not be an assistant in a philadelphia hospital taxing her strength with arduous routine duties day by day in order to lighten a little the burdens that weigh upon her unfortunate family it is altogether a bad business an honest historian who had progressed thus far and traced everything to such a condition of disaster and suspension might well be justified in ending his narrative and writing after this the deluge his only consolation would be in the reflection that he was not responsible for either characters or events and the most annoying thought is that a little money judiciously applied would relieve the burdens and anxieties of most of these people but affairs seem to be so arranged that money is most difficult to get when people need it most a little of what mr bolton has weakly given to unworthy people would now establish his family in a sort of comfort and relieve ruth of the excessive toil for which she inherited no adequate physical vigor a little money would make a prince of col sellers and a little more would calm the anxiety of washington hawkins about laura for however the trial ended he could feel sure of extricating her in the end and if philip had a little money he could unlock the stone door in the mountain whence would issue a stream of shining riches it needs a golden wand to strike that rock if the knobs university bill could only go through what a change would be wrought in the condition of most of the persons in this history even philip himself would feel the good effects of it for harry would have something and col sellers would have something and have not both these cautious people expressed a determination to take an interest in the ilium mine when they catch their larks philip could not resist the inclination to pay a visit to fallkill he had not been at the montagues since the time he saw ruth there and he wanted to consult the squire about an occupation he was determined now to waste no more time in waiting on providence but to go to work at something if it were nothing better than teaching in the fallkill seminary or digging clams on hingham beach perhaps he could read law in squire montagues office while earning his bread as a teacher in the seminary it was not altogether philips fault let us own that he was in this position there are many young men like him in american society of his age opportunities education and abilities who have really been educated for nothing and have let themselves drift in the hope that they will find somehow and by some sudden turn of good luck the golden road to fortune he was not idle or lazy he had energy and a disposition to carve his own way but he was born into a time when all young men of his age caught the fever of speculation and expected to get on in the world by the omission of some of the regular processes which have been appointed from of old and examples were not wanting to encourage him he saw people all around him poor yesterday rich today who had come into sudden opulence by some means which they could not have classified among any of the regular occupations of life a war would give such a fellow a career and very likely fame he might have been a railroad man or a politician or a land speculator or one of those mysterious people who travel free on all railroads and steamboats and are continually crossing and recrossing the atlantic driven day and night about nobody knows what and make a great deal of money by so doing probably at last he sometimes thought with a whimsical smile he should end by being an insurance agent and asking people to insure their lives for his benefit possibly philip did not think how much the attractions of fallkill were increased by the presence of alice there he had known her so long she had somehow grown into his life by habit that he would expect the pleasure of her society without thinking mach about it latterly he never thought of her without thinking of ruth and if he gave the subject any attention it was probably in an undefined consciousness that he had her sympathy in his love and that she was always willing to hear him talk about it if he ever wondered that alice herself was not in love and never spoke of the possibility of her own marriage it was a transient thought for love did not seem necessary exactly to one so calm and evenly balanced and with so many resources in her herself whatever her thoughts may have been they were unknown to philip as they are to these historians if she was seeming to be what she was not and carrying a burden heavier than any one else carried because she had to bear it alone she was only doing what thousands of women do with a selfrenunciation and heroism of which men impatient and complaining have no conception have not these big babies with beards filled all literature with their outcries their griefs and their lamentations it is always the gentle sex which is hard and cruel and fickle and implacable do you think you would be contented to live in fallkill and attend the county court asked alice when philip had opened the budget of his new programme perhaps not always said philip i might go and practice in boston maybe or go to chicago or you might get elected to congress philip looked at alice to see if she was in earnest and not chaffing him her face was quite sober alice was one of those patriotic women in the rural districts who think men are still selected for congress on account of qualifications for the office no said philip the chances are that a man cannot get into congress now without resorting to arts and means that should render hint unfit to go there of course there are exceptions but do you know that i could not go into politics if i were a lawyer without losing standing somewhat in my profession and without raising at least a suspicion of my intentions and unselfishness why it is telegraphed all over the country and commented on as something wonderful if a congressman votes honestly and unselfishly and refuses to take advantage of his position to steal from the government but insisted alice i should think it a noble ambition to go to congress if it is so bad and help reform it i dont believe it is as corrupt as the english parliament used to be if there is any truth in the novels and i suppose that is reformed im sure i dont know where the reform is to begin ive seen a perfectly capable honest man time and again run against an illiterate trickster and get beaten i suppose if the people wanted decent members of congress they would elect them perhaps continued philip with a smile the women will have to vote well i should be willing to if it were a necessity just as i would go to war and do what i could if the country couldnt be saved otherwise said alice with a spirit that surprised philip well as he thought he knew her if i were a young gentleman in these times philip laughed outright its just what ruth used to say if she were a man i wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change of sex no only a changed sex retorted alice we contemplate for the most part young men who dont care for anything they ought to care for well said philip looking humble i care for some things you and ruth for instance perhaps i ought not to perhaps i ought to care for congress and that sort of thing dont be a goose philip i heard from ruth yesterday can i see her letter no indeed but i am afraid her hard work is telling on her together with her anxiety about her father do you think alice asked philip with one of those selfish thoughts that are not seldom mixed with real love that ruth prefers her profession to to marriage philip exclaimed alice rising to quit the room and speaking hurriedly as if the words were forced from her you are as blind as a bat ruth would cut off her right hand for you this minute philip never noticed that alices face was flushed and that her voice was unsteady he only thought of the delicious words he had heard and the poor girl loyal to ruth loyal to philip went straight to her room locked the door threw herself on the bed and sobbed as if her heart world break and then she prayed that her father in heaven would give her strength and after a time she was calm again and went to her bureau drawer and took from a hiding place a little piece of paper yellow with age upon it was pinned a fourleaved clover dry and yellow also she looked long at this foolish memento under the clover leaf was written in a schoolgirls hand philip june squire montague thought very well of philips proposal it would have been better if he had begun the study of the law as soon as he left college but it was not too late now and besides he had gathered some knowledge of the world but asked the squire do you mean to abandon your land in pennsylvania this track of land seemed an immense possible fortune to this new england lawyerfarmer hasnt it good timber and doesnt the railroad almost touch it i cant do anything with it now perhaps i can sometime what is your reason for supposing that there is coal there the opinion of the best geologist i could consult my own observation of the country and the little veins of it we found i feel certain it is there i shall find it some day i know it if i can only keep the land till i make money enough to try again philip took from his pocket a map of the anthracite coal region and pointed out the position of the ilium mountain which he had begun to tunnel doesnt it look like it it certainly does said the squire very much interested it is not unusual for a quiet country gentleman to be more taken with such a venture than a speculator who has had more experience in its uncertainty it was astonishing how many new england clergymen in the time of the petroleum excitement took chances in oil the wall street brokers are said to do a good deal of small business for country clergymen who are moved no doubt with the laudable desire of purifying the new york stock board i dont see that there is much risk said the squire at length the timber is worth more than the mortgage and if that coal seam does run there its a magnificent fortune would you like to try it again in the spring phil like to try it if he could have a little help he would work himself with pick and barrow and live on a crust only give him one more chance and this is how it came about that the cautious old squire montague was drawn into this young fellows speculation and began to have his serene old age disturbed by anxieties and by the hope of a great stroke of luck to be sure i only care about it for the boy he said the squire was like everybody else sooner or later he must take a chance it is probably on account of the lack of enterprise in women that they are not so fond of stock speculations and mine ventures as men it is only when woman becomes demoralized that she takes to any sort of gambling neither alice nor ruth were much elated with the prospect of philips renewal of his mining enterprise but philip was exultant he wrote to ruth as if his fortune were already made and as if the clouds that lowered over the house of bolton were already in the deep bosom of a coal mine buried towards spring he went to philadelphia with his plans all matured for a new campaign his enthusiasm was irresistible philip has come philip has come cried the children as if some great good had again come into the household and the refrain even sang itself over in ruths heart as she went the weary hospital rounds mr bolton felt more courage than he had had in months at the sight of his manly face and the sound of his cheery voice ruths course was vindicated now and it certainly did not become philip who had nothing to offer but a future chance against the visible result of her determination and industry to open an argument with her ruth was never more certain that she was right and that she was sufficient unto herself she may be did not much heed the still small voice that sang in her maiden heart as she went about her work and which lightened it and made it easy philip has come i am glad for fathers sake she said to philip that thee has come i can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do he thinks women wont hold out long added ruth with the smile that philip never exactly understood and arent you tired sometimes of the struggle tired yes everybody is tired i suppose but it is a glorious profession and would you want me to be dependent philip well yes a little said philip feeling his way towards what he wanted to say on what for instance just now asked ruth a little maliciously philip thought why on he couldnt quite say it for it occurred to him that he was a poor stick for any body to lean on in the present state of his fortune and that the woman before him was at least as independent as he was i dont mean depend he began again but i love you thats all am i nothing to you and philip looked a little defiant and as if he had said something that ought to brush away all the sophistries of obligation on either side between man and woman perhaps ruth saw this perhaps she saw that her own theories of a certain equality of power which ought to precede a union of two hearts might be pushed too far perhaps she had felt sometimes her own weakness and the need after all of so dear a sympathy and so tender an interest confessed as that which philip could give whatever moved her the riddle is as old as creation she simply looked up to philip and said in a low voice everything and philip clasping both her hands in his and looking down into her eyes which drank in all his tenderness with the thirst of a true womans nature oh philip come out here shouted young eli throwing the door wide open and ruth escaped away to her room her heart singing again and now as if it would burst for joy philip has come that night philip received a dispatch from harry the trial begins tomorrow chapter li december found washington hawkins and col sellers once more at the capitol of the nation standing guard over the university bill the former gentleman was despondent the latter hopeful washingtons distress of mind was chiefly on lauras account the court would soon sit to try her case he said and consequently a great deal of ready money would be needed in the engineering of it the university bill was sure to pass this time and that would make money plenty but might not the help come too late congress had only just assembled and delays were to be feared well said the colonel i dont know but you are more or less right there now lets figure up a little on the preliminaries i think congress always tries to do as near right as it can according to its lights a man cant ask any fairer than that the first preliminary it always starts out on is to clean itself so to speak it will arraign two or three dozen of its members or maybe four or five dozen for taking bribes to vote for this and that and the other bill last winter it goes up into the dozens does it well yes in a free country likes ours where any man can run for congress and anybody can vote for him you cant expect immortal purity all the time it aint in nature sixty or eighty or a hundred and fifty people are bound to get in who are not angels in disguise as young hicks the correspondent says but still it is a very good average very good indeed as long as it averages as well as that i think we can feel very well satisfied even in these days when people growl so much and the newspapers are so out of patience there is still a very respectable minority of honest men in congress why a respectable minority of honest men cant do any good colonel oh yes it can too why how oh in many ways many ways but what are the ways well i dont know it is a question that requires time a body cant answer every question right offhand but it does do good i am satisfied of that all right then grant that it does good go on with the preliminaries that is what i am coming to first as i said they will try a lot of members for taking money for votes that will take four weeks yes thats like last year and it is a sheer waste of the time for which the nation pays those men to work that is what that is and it pinches when a bodys got a bill waiting a waste of time to purify the fountain of public law well i never heard anybody express an idea like that before but if it were it would still be the fault of the minority for the majority dont institute these proceedings there is where that minority becomes an obstruction but still one cant say it is on the wrong side well after they have finished the bribery cases they will take up cases of members who have bought their seats with money that will take another four weeks very good go on you have accounted for twothirds of the session next they will try each other for various smaller irregularities like the sale of appointments to west point cadetships and that sort of thing mere trifling pocketmoney enterprises that might better be passed over in silence perhaps but then one of our congresses can never rest easy till it has thoroughly purified itself of all blemishes and that is a thing to be applauded how long does it take to disinfect itself of these minor impurities well about two weeks generally so congress always lies helpless in quarantine ten weeks of a session thats encouraging colonel poor laura will never get any benefit from our bill her trial will be over before congress has half purified itself and doesnt it occur to you that by the time it has expelled all its impure members there may not be enough members left to do business legally why i did not say congress would expel anybody well wont it expel anybody not necessarily did it last year it never does that would not be regular then why waste all the session in that tomfoolery of trying members it is usual it is customary the country requires it then the country is a fool i think oh no the country thinks somebody is going to be expelled well when nobody is expelled what does the country think then by that time the thing has strung out so long that the country is sick and tired of it and glad to have a change on any terms but all that inquiry is not lost it has a good moral effect who does it have a good moral effect on well i dont know on foreign countries i think we have always been under the gaze of foreign countries there is no country in the world sir that pursues corruption as inveterately as we do there is no country in the world whose representatives try each other as much as ours do or stick to it as long on a stretch i think there is something great in being a model for the whole civilized world washington you dont mean a model you mean an example well its all the same its just the same thing it shows that a man cant be corrupt in this country without sweating for it i can tell you that hang it colonel you just said we never punish anybody for villainous practices but good god we try them dont we is it nothing to show a disposition to sift things and bring people to a strict account i tell you it has its effect oh bother the effect what is it they do do how do they proceed you know perfectly well and it is all bosh too come now how do they proceed why they proceed right and regular and it aint bosh washington it aint bosh they appoint a committee to investigate and that committee hears evidence three weeks and all the witnesses on one side swear that the accused took money or stock or something for his vote then the accused stands up and testifies that he may have done it but he was receiving and handling a good deal of money at the time and he doesnt remember this particular circumstance at least with sufficient distinctness to enable him to grasp it tangibly so of course the thing is not proven and that is what they say in the verdict they dont acquit they dont condemn they just say charge not proven it leaves the accused is a kind of a shaky condition before the country it purifies congress it satisfies everybody and it doesnt seriously hurt anybody it has taken a long time to perfect our system but it is the most admirable in the world now so one of those long stupid investigations always turns out in that lame silly way yes you are correct i thought maybe you viewed the matter differently from other people do you think a congress of ours could convict the devil of anything if he were a member my dear boy dont let these damaging delays prejudice you against congress dont use such strong language you talk like a newspaper congress has inflicted frightful punishments on its members now you know that when they tried mr fairoaks and a cloud of witnesses proved him to be well you know what they proved him to be and his own testimony and his own confessions gave him the same character what did congress do then come well what did congress do you know what congress did washington congress intimated plainly enough that they considered him almost a stain upon their body and without waiting ten days hardly to think the thing over the rose up and hurled at him a resolution declaring that they disapproved of his conduct now you know that washington it was a terrific thing there is no denying that if he had been proven guilty of theft arson licentiousness infanticide and defiling graves i believe they would have suspended him for two days you can depend on it washington congress is vindictive congress is savage sir when it gets waked up once it will go to any length to vindicate its honor at such a time ah well we have talked the morning through just as usual in these tiresome days of waiting and we have reached the same old result that is to say we are no better off than when we began the land bill is just as far away as ever and the trial is closer at hand lets give up everything and die die and leave the duchess to fight it out all alone oh no that wont do come now dont talk so it is all going to come out right now youll see it never will colonel never in the world something tells me that i get more tired and more despondent every day i dont see any hope life is only just a trouble i am so miserable these days the colonel made washington get up and walk the floor with him arm in arm the good old speculator wanted to comfort him but he hardly knew how to go about it he made many attempts but they were lame they lacked spirit the words were encouraging but they were only words he could not get any heart into them he could not always warm up now with the old hawkeye fervor by and by his lips trembled and his voice got unsteady he said dont give up the ship my boy dont do it the winds bound to fetch around and set in our favor i know it and the prospect was so cheerful that he wept then he blew a trumpetblast that started the meshes of his handkerchief and said in almost his breezy oldtime way lord bless us this is all nonsense night doesnt last always day has got to break some time or other every silver lining has a cloud behind it as the poet says and that remark has always cheered me though i never could see any meaning to it everybody uses it though and everybody gets comfort out of it i wish they would start something fresh come now lets cheer up theres been as good fish in the sea as there are now it shall never be said that beriah sellers come in it was the telegraph boy the colonel reached for the message and devoured its contents i said it never give up the ship the trials postponed till february and well save the child yet bless my life what lawyers they have in newyork give them money to fight with and the ghost of an excuse and they would manage to postpone anything in this world unless it might be the millennium or something like that now for work again my boy the trial will last to the middle of march sure congress ends the fourth of march within three days of the end of the session they will be done putting through the preliminaries then they will be ready for national business our bill will go through in fortyeight hours then and well telegraph a million dollars to the jury to the lawyers i mean and the verdict of the jury will be accidental murder resulting from justifiable insanity or something to that effect something to that effect everything is dead sure now come what is the matter what are you wilting down like that for you mustnt be a girl you know oh colonel i am become so used to troubles so used to failures disappointments hard luck of all kinds that a little good news breaks me right down everything has been so hopeless that now i cant stand good news at all it is too good to be true anyway dont you see how our bad luck has worked on me my hair is getting gray and many nights i dont sleep at all i wish it was all over and we could rest i wish we could lie down and just forget everything and let it all be just a dream that is done and cant come back to trouble us any more i am so tired ah poor child dont talk like thatcheer up theres daylight ahead dont give up youll have laura again and louise and your mother and oceans and oceans of money and then you can go away ever so far away somewhere if you want to and forget all about this infernal place and by george ill go with you ill go with you now theres my word on it cheer up ill run out and tell the friends the news and he wrung washingtons hand and was about to hurry away when his companion in a burst of grateful admiration said i think you are the best soul and the noblest i ever knew colonel sellers and if the people only knew you as i do you would not be tagging around here a nameless man you would be in congress the gladness died out of the colonels face and he laid his hand upon washingtons shoulder and said gravely i have always been a friend of your family washington and i think i have always tried to do right as between man and man according to my lights now i dont think there has ever been anything in my conduct that should make you feel justified in saying a thing like that he turned then and walked slowly out leaving washington abashed and somewhat bewildered when washington had presently got his thoughts into line again he said to himself why honestly i only meant to compliment him indeed i would not have hurt him for the world chapter lii the weeks drifted by monotonously enough now the preliminaries continued to drag along in congress and life was a dull suspense to sellers and washington a weary waiting which might have broken their hearts maybe but for the relieving change which they got out of am occasional visit to new york to see laura standing guard in washington or anywhere else is not an exciting business in time of peace but standing guard was all that the two friends had to do all that was needed of them was that they should be on hand and ready for any emergency that might come up there was no work to do that was all finished this was but the second session of the last winters congress and its action on the bill could have but one result its passage the house must do its work over again of course but the same membership was there to see that it did it the senate was secure senator dilworthy was able to put all doubts to rest on that head indeed it was no secret in washington that a twothirds vote in the senate was ready and waiting to be cast for the university bill as soon as it should come before that body washington did not take part in the gaieties of the season as he had done the previous winter he had lost his interest in such things he was oppressed with cares now senator dilworthy said to washington that an humble deportment under punishment was best and that there was but one way in which the troubled heart might find perfect repose and peace the suggestion found a response in washingtons breast and the senator saw the sign of it in his face from that moment one could find the youth with the senator even oftener than with col sellers when the statesman presided at great temperance meetings he placed washington in the front rank of impressive dignitaries that gave tone to the occasion and pomp to the platform his bald headed surroundings made the youth the more conspicuous when the statesman made remarks in these meetings he not infrequently alluded with effect to the encouraging spectacle of one of the wealthiest and most brilliant young favorites of society forsaking the light vanities of that butterfly existence to nobly and selfsacrificingly devote his talents and his riches to the cause of saving his hapless fellow creatures from shame and misery here and eternal regret hereafter at the prayer meetings the senator always brought washington up the aisle on his arm and seated him prominently in his prayers he referred to him in the cant terms which the senator employed perhaps unconsciously and mistook maybe for religion and in other ways brought him into notice he had him out at gatherings for the benefit of the negro gatherings for the benefit of the indian gatherings for the benefit of the heathen in distant lands he had him out time and again before sunday schools as an example for emulation upon all these occasions the senator made casual references to many benevolent enterprises which his ardent young friend was planning against the day when the passage of the university bill should make his means available for the amelioration of the condition of the unfortunate among his fellow men of all nations and all climes thus as the weeks rolled on washington grew up into an imposing lion once more but a lion that roamed the peaceful fields of religion and temperance and revisited the glittering domain of fashion no more a great moral influence was thus brought to bear in favor of the bill the weightiest of friends flocked to its standard its most energetic enemies said it was useless to fight longer they had tacitly surrendered while as yet the day of battle was not come chapter liii the session was drawing toward its close senator dilworthy thought he would run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them look at him the legislature whose duty it would be to reelect him to the united states senate was already in session mr dilworthy considered his reelection certain but he was a careful painstaking man and if by visiting his state he could find the opportunity to persuade a few more legislators to vote for him he held the journey to be well worth taking the university bill was safe now he could leave it without fear it needed his presence and his watching no longer but there was a person in his state legislature who did need watching a person who senator dilworthy said was a narrow grumbling uncomfortable malcontent a person who was stolidly opposed to reform and progress and him a person who he feared had been bought with money to combat him and through him the commonwealths welfare and its politics purity if this person noble said mr dilworthy in a little speech at a dinner party given him by some of his admirers merely desired to sacrifice me i would willingly offer up my political life on the altar of my dear states weal i would be glad and grateful to do it but when he makes of me but a cloak to hide his deeper designs when he proposes to strike through me at the heart of my beloved state all the lion in me is roused and i say here i stand solitary and alone but unflinching unquailing thrice armed with my sacred trust and whoso passes to do evil to this fair domain that looks to me for protection must do so over my dead body he further said that if this noble were a pure man and merely misguided he could bear it but that he should succeed in his wicked designs through a base use of money would leave a blot upon his state which would work untold evil to the morals of the people and that he would not suffer the public morals must not be contaminated he would seek this man noble he would argue he would persuade he would appeal to his honor when he arrived on the ground he found his friends unterrified they were standing firmly by him and were full of courage noble was working hard too but matters were against him he was not making much progress mr dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for mr noble he had a midnight interview with him and urged him to forsake his evil ways he begged him to come again and again which he did he finally sent the man away at oclock one morning and when he was gone mr dilworthy said to himself i feel a good deal relieved now a great deal relieved the senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of his people he appeared in church he took a leading part in prayer meetings he met and encouraged the temperance societies he graced the sewing circles of the ladies with his presence and even took a needle now and then and made a stitch or two upon a calico shirt for some poor bibleless pagan of the south seas and this act enchanted the ladies who regarded the garments thus honored as in a manner sanctified the senator wrought in bible classes and nothing could keep him away from the sunday schools neither sickness nor storms nor weariness he even traveled a tedious thirty miles in a poor little rickety stagecoach to comply with the desire of the miserable hamlet of cattleville that he would let its sunday school look upon him all the town was assembled at the stage office when he arrived two bonfires were burning and a battery of anvils was popping exultant broadsides for a united states senator was a sort of god in the understanding of these people who never had seen any creature mightier than a county judge to them a united states senator was a vast vague colossus an awe inspiring unreality next day everybody was at the village church a full half hour before time for sunday school to open ranchmen and farmers had come with their families from five miles around all eager to get a glimpse of the great man the man who had been to washington the man who had seen the president of the united states and had even talked with him the man who had seen the actual washington monument perhaps touched it with his hands when the senator arrived the church was crowded the windows were full the aisles were packed so was the vestibule and so indeed was the yard in front of the building as he worked his way through to the pulpit on the arm of the minister and followed by the envied officials of the village every neck was stretched and every eye twisted around intervening obstructions to get a glimpse elderly people directed each others attention and said there thats him with the grand noble forehead boys nudged each other and said hi johnny here he is there thats him with the peeled head the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him and the superintendent of the sunday school on the other the town dignitaries sat in an impressive row within the altar railings below the sunday school children occupied ten of the front benches dressed in their best and most uncomfortable clothes and with hair combed and faces too clean to feel natural so awed were they by the presence of a living united states senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pulling hair the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and bored the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar then the town dignitaries had their say they all made complimentary reference to their friend the senator and told what a great and illustrious man he was and what he had done for his country and for religion and temperance and exhorted the little boys to be good and diligent and try to become like him some day the speakers won the deathless hatred of the house by these delays but at last there was an end and hope revived inspiration was about to find utterance senator dilworthy rose and beamed upon the assemblage for a full minute in silence then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the children and began my little friends for i hope that all these brightfaced little people are my friends and will let me be their friend my little friends i have traveled much i have been in many cities and many states everywhere in our great and noble country and by the blessing of providence i have been permitted to see many gatherings like this but i am proud i am truly proud to say that i never have looked upon so much intelligence so much grace such sweetness of disposition as i see in the charming young countenances i see before me at this moment i have been asking myself as i sat here where am i am i in some faroff monarchy looking upon little princes and princesses no am i in some populous centre of my own country where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize no am i in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels that we know not of no then where am i yes where am i i am in a simple remote unpretending settlement of my own dear state and these are the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what i am my soul is lost in wonder at the thought and i humbly thank him to whom we are but as worms of the dust that he has been pleased to call me to serve such men earth has no higher no grander position for me let kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns i want them not my heart is here again i thought is this a theatre no is it a concert or a gilded opera no is it some other vain brilliant beautiful temple of soulstaining amusement and hilarity no then what is it what did my consciousness reply i ask you my little friends what did my consciousness reply it replied it is the temple of the lord ah think of that now i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful oh how beautiful it is to see these ranks of sunny little faces assembled here to learn the way of life to learn to be good to learn to be useful to learn to be pious to learn to be great and glorious men and women to learn to be props and pillars of the state and shining lights in the councils and the households of the nation to be bearers of the banner and soldiers of the cross in the rude campaigns of life and raptured souls in the happy fields of paradise hereafter children honor your parents and be grateful to them for providing for you the precious privileges of a sunday school now my dear little friends sit up straight and pretty there thats it and give me your attention and let me tell you about a poor little sunday school scholar i once knew he lived in the far west and his parents were poor they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school he loved the sunday school i hope you love your sunday school ah i see by your faces that you do that is right well this poor little boy was always in his place when the bell rang and he always knew his lesson for his teachers wanted him to learn and he loved his teachers dearly always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now he would not let bad boys persuade him to go to play on sunday there was one little bad boy who was always trying to persuade him but he never could so this poor little boy grew up to be a man and had to go out in the world far from home and friends to earn his living temptations lay all about him and sometimes he was about to yield but he would think of some precious lesson he learned in his sunday school a long time ago and that would save him by and by he was elected to the legislature then he did everything he could for sunday schools he got laws passed for them he got sunday schools established wherever he could and by and by the people made him governor and he said it was all owing to the sunday school after a while the people elected him a representative to the congress of the united states and he grew very famous now temptations assailed him on every hand people tried to get him to drink wine to dance to go to theatres they even tried to buy his vote but no the memory of his sunday school saved him from all harm he remembered the fate of the bad little boy who used to try to get him to play on sunday and who grew up and became a drunkard and was hanged he remembered that and was glad he never yielded and played on sunday well at last what do you think happened why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position and what do you think it was what should you say it was children it was senator of the united states that poor little boy that loved his sunday school became that man that man stands before you all that he is he owes to the sunday school my precious children love your parents love your teachers love your sunday school be pious be obedient be honest be diligent and then you will succeed in life and be honored of all men above all things my children be honest above all things be pureminded as the snow let us join in prayer when senator dilworthy departed from cattleville he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the united states senate when be arrived at the state capital at midnight mr noble came and held a threehours conference with him and then as he was about leaving said ive worked hard and ive got them at last six of them havent got quite backbone enough to slew around and come right out for you on the first ballot tomorrow but theyre going to vote against you on the first for the sake of appearances and then come out for you all in a body on the second ive fixed all that by supper time tomorrow youll be reelected you can go to bed and sleep easy on that after mr noble was gone the senator said well to bring about a complexion of things like this was worth coming west for chapter liv the case of the state of new york against laura hawkins was finally set down for trial on the th day of february less than a year after the shooting of george selby if the public had almost forgotten the existence of laura and her crime they were reminded of all the details of the murder by the newspapers which for some days had been announcing the approaching trial but they had not forgotten the sex the age the beauty of the prisoner her high social position in washington the unparalleled calmness with which the crime was committed had all conspired to fix the event in the public mind although nearly three hundred and sixtyfive subsequent murders had occurred to vary the monotony of metropolitan life no the public read from time to time of the lovely prisoner languishing in the city prison the tortured victim of the laws delay and as the months went by it was natural that the horror of her crime should become a little indistinct in memory while the heroine of it should be invested with a sort of sentimental interest perhaps her counsel had calculated on this perhaps it was by their advice that laura had interested herself in the unfortunate criminals who shared her prison confinement and had done not a little to relieve from her own purse the necessities of some of the poor creatures that she had done this the public read in the journals of the day and the simple announcement cast a softening light upon her character the court room was crowded at an early hour before the arrival of judges lawyers and prisoner there is no enjoyment so keen to certain minds as that of looking upon the slow torture of a human being on trial for life except it be an execution there is no display of human ingenuity wit and power so fascinating as that made by trained lawyers in the trial of an important case nowhere else is exhibited such subtlety acumen address eloquence all the conditions of intense excitement meet in a murder trial the awful issue at stake gives significance to the lightest word or look how the quick eyes of the spectators rove from the stolid jury to the keen lawyers the impassive judge the anxious prisoner nothing is lost of the sharp wrangle of the counsel on points of law the measured decisions of the bench the duels between the attorneys and the witnesses the crowd sways with the rise and fall of the shifting testimony in sympathetic interest and hangs upon the dicta of the judge in breathless silence it speedily takes sides for or against the accused and recognizes as quickly its favorites among the lawyers nothing delights it more than the sharp retort of a witness and the discomfiture of an obnoxious attorney a joke even if it be a lame one is no where so keenly relished or quickly applauded as in a murder trial within the bar the young lawyers and the privileged hangerson filled all the chairs except those reserved at the table for those engaged in the case without the throng occupied all the seats the window ledges and the standing room the atmosphere was already something horrible it was the peculiar odor of a criminal court as if it were tainted by the presence in different persons of all the crimes that men and women can commit there was a little stir when the prosecuting attorney with two assistants made his way in seated himself at the table and spread his papers before him there was more stir when the counsel of the defense appeared they were mr braham the senior and mr quiggle and mr okeefe the juniors everybody in the court room knew mr braham the great criminal lawyer and he was not unaware that he was the object of all eyes as he moved to his place bowing to his friends in the bar a large but rather spare man with broad shoulders and a massive head covered with chestnut curls which fell down upon his coat collar and which he had a habit of shaking as a lion is supposed to shake his mane his face was clean shaven and he had a wide mouth and rather small dark eyes set quite too near together mr braham wore a brown frock coat buttoned across his breast with a rosebud in the upper buttonhole and light pantaloons a diamond stud was seen to flash from his bosom and as he seated himself and drew off his gloves a heavy seal ring was displayed upon his white left hand mr braham having seated himself deliberately surveyed the entire house made a remark to one of his assistants and then taking an ivoryhandled knife from his pocket began to pare his finger nails rocking his chair backwards and forwards slowly a moment later judge oshaunnessy entered at the rear door and took his seat in one of the chairs behind the bench a gentleman in black broadcloth with sandy hair inclined to curl a round reddish and rather jovial face sharp rather than intellectual and with a selfsufficient air his career had nothing remarkable in it he was descended from a long line of irish kings and he was the first one of them who had ever come into his kingdom the kingdom of such being the city of new york he had in fact descended so far and so low that he found himself when a boy a sort of street arab in that city but he had ambition and native shrewdness and he speedily took to bootpolishing and newspaper hawking became the office and errand boy of a law firm picked up knowledge enough to get some employment in police courts was admitted to the bar became a rising young politician went to the legislature and was finally elected to the bench which he now honored in this democratic country he was obliged to conceal his royalty under a plebeian aspect judge oshaunnessy never had a lucrative practice nor a large salary but he had prudently laid away moneybelieving that a dependant judge can never be impartial and he had lands and houses to the value of three or four hundred thousand dollars had he not helped to build and furnish this very court house did he not know that the very spittoon which his judgeship used cost the city the sum of one thousand dollars as soon as the judge was seated the court was opened with the oi yis oi yis of the officer in his native language the case called and the sheriff was directed to bring in the prisoner in the midst of a profound hush laura entered leaning on the arm of the officer and was conducted to a seat by her counsel she was followed by her mother and by washington hawkins who were given seats near her laura was very pale but this pallor heightened the lustre of her large eyes and gave a touching sadness to her expressive face she was dressed in simple black with exquisite taste and without an ornament the thin lace vail which partially covered her face did not so much conceal as heighten her beauty she would not have entered a drawing room with more selfpoise nor a church with more haughty humility there was in her manner or face neither shame nor boldness and when she took her seat in fall view of half the spectators her eyes were downcast a murmur of admiration ran through the room the newspaper reporters made their pencils fly mr braham again swept his eyes over the house as if in approval when laura at length raised her eyes a little she saw philip and harry within the bar but she gave no token of recognition the clerk then read the indictment which was in the usual form it charged laura hawkins in effect with the premeditated murder of george selby by shooting him with a pistol with a revolver shotgun rifle repeater breechloader cannon sixshooter with a gun or some other weapon with killing him with a slungshot a bludgeon carving knife bowie knife pen knife rolling pin car hook dagger hair pin with a hammer with a screwdriver with a nail and with all other weapons and utensils whatsoever at the southern hotel and in all other hotels and places wheresoever on the thirteenth day of march and all other days of the christian era wheresoever laura stood while the long indictment was read and at the end in response to the inquiry of the judge she said in a clear low voice not guilty she sat down and the court proceeded to impanel a jury the first man called was michael lanigan saloon keeper have you formed or expressed any opinion on this case and do you know any of the parties not any said mr lanigan have you any conscientious objections to capital punishment no sir not to my knowledge have you read anything about this case to be sure i read the papers yr honor objected to by mr braham for cause and discharged patrick coughlin what is your business well i havent got any particular business havent any particular business eh well whats your general business what do you do for a living i own some terriers sir own some terriers eh keep a rat pit gentlemen comes there to have a little sport i never fit em sir oh i see you are probably the amusement committee of the city council have you ever heard of this case not till this morning sir can you read not fine print yr honor the man was about to be sworn when mr braham asked could your father read the old gentleman was mighty handy at that sir mr braham submitted that the man was disqualified judge thought not point argued challenged peremptorily and set aside ethan dobb cartdriver can you read yes but havent a habit of it have you heard of this case i think so but it might be another i have no opinion about it dist a tha tha there hold on a bit did anybody tell you to say you had no opinion about it n n o sir take care now take care then what suggested it to you to volunteer that remark theyve always asked that when i was on juries all right then have you any conscientious scruples about capital punishment any which would you object to finding a person guilty of murder on evidence i might sir if i thought he want guilty the district attorney thought he saw a point would this feeling rather incline you against a capital conviction the juror said he hadnt any feeling and didnt know any of the parties accepted and sworn dennis lafin laborer have neither formed nor expressed an opinion never had heard of the case believed in hangin for them that deserved it could read if it was necessary mr braham objected the man was evidently bloody minded challenged peremptorily larry otoole contractor a showily dressed man of the style known as vulgar genteel had a sharp eye and a ready tongue had read the newspaper reports of the case but they made no impression on him should be governed by the evidence knew no reason why he could not be an impartial juror question by district attorney how is it that the reports made no impression on you never believe anything i see in the newspapers laughter from the crowd approving smiles from his honor and mr braham juror sworn in mr braham whispered to okeefe thats the man avery hicks peanut peddler did he ever hear of this case the man shook his head can you read no any scruples about capital punishment no he was about to be sworn when the district attorney turning to him carelessly remarked understand the nature of an oath outside said the man pointing to the door i say do you know what an oath is five cents explained the man do you mean to insult me roared the prosecuting officer are you an idiot fresh baked im deefe i dont hear a word you say the man was discharged he wouldnt have made a bad juror though whispered braham i saw him looking at the prisoner sympathizingly thats a point you want to watch for the result of the whole days work was the selection of only two jurors these however were satisfactory to mr braham he had kept off all those he did not know no one knew better than this great criminal lawyer that the battle was fought on the selection of the jury the subsequent examination of witnesses the eloquence expended on the jury are all for effect outside at least that is the theory of mr braham but human nature is a queer thing he admits sometimes jurors are unaccountably swayed be as careful as you can in choosing them it was four weary days before this jury was made up but when it was finally complete it did great credit to the counsel for the defence so far as mr braham knew only two could read one of whom was the foreman mr brahams friend the showy contractor low foreheads and heavy faces they all had some had a look of animal cunning while the most were only stupid the entire panel formed that boasted heritage commonly described as the bulwark of our liberties the district attorney mr mcflinn opened the case for the state he spoke with only the slightest accent one that had been inherited but not cultivated he contented himself with a brief statement of the case the state would prove that laura hawkins the prisoner at the bar a fiend in the form of a beautiful woman shot dead george selby a southern gentleman at the time and place described that the murder was in cold blood deliberate and without provocation that it had been long premeditated and threatened that she had followed the deceasedfrom washington to commit it all this would be proved by unimpeachable witnesses the attorney added that the duty of the jury however painful it might be would be plain and simple they were citizens husbands perhaps fathers they knew how insecure life had become in the metropolis tomorrow our own wives might be widows their own children orphans like the bereaved family in yonder hotel deprived of husband and father by the jealous hand of some murderous female the attorney sat down and the clerk called henry brierly chapter lv henry brierly took the stand requested by the district attorney to tell the jury all he knew about the killing he narrated the circumstances substantially as the reader already knows them he accompanied miss hawkins to new york at her request supposing she was coming in relation to a bill then pending in congress to secure the attendance of absent members her note to him was here shown she appeared to be very much excited at the washington station after she had asked the conductor several questions he heard her say he cant escape witness asked her who and she replied nobody did not see her during the night they traveled in a sleeping car in the morning she appeared not to have slept said she had a headache in crossing the ferry she asked him about the shipping in sight he pointed out where the cunarders lay when in port they took a cup of coffee that morning at a restaurant she said she was anxious to reach the southern hotel where mr simons one of the absent members was staying before he went out she was entirely selfpossessed and beyond unusual excitement did not act unnaturally after she had fired twice at col selby she turned the pistol towards her own breast and witness snatched it from her she had seen a great deal with selby in washington appeared to be infatuated with him crossexamined by mr braham misterer brierly mr braham had in perfection this lawyers trick of annoying a witness by drawling out the mister as if unable to recall the name until the witness is sufficiently aggravated and then suddenly with a rising inflection flinging his name at him with startling unexpectedness misterer brierly what is your occupation civil engineer sir ah civil engineer with a glance at the jury following that occupation with miss hawkins smiles by the jury no sir said harry reddening how long have you known the prisoner two years sir i made her acquaintance in hawkeye missouri mmm misterer brierly were you not a lover of miss hawkins objected to i submit your honor that i have the right to establish the relation of this unwilling witness to the prisoner admitted well sir said harry hesitatingly we were friends you act like a friend sarcastically the jury were beginning to hate this neatly dressed young sprig mistererbrierly didnt miss hawkins refuse you harry blushed and stammered and looked at the judge you must answer sir said his honor she she didnt accept me no i should think not brierly do you dare tell the jury that you had not an interest in the removal of your rival col selby roared mr braham in a voice of thunder nothing like this sir nothing like this protested the witness thats all sir said mr braham severely one word said the district attorney had you the least suspicion of the prisoners intention up to the moment of the shooting not the least answered harry earnestly of course not of coursenot nodded mr braham to the jury the prosecution then put upon the stand the other witnesses of the shooting at the hotel and the clerk and the attending physicians the fact of the homicide was clearly established nothing new was elicited except from the clerk in reply to a question by mr braham the fact that when the prisoner enquired for col selby she appeared excited and there was a wild look in her eyes the dying deposition of col selby was then produced it set forth lauras threats but there was a significant addition to it which the newspaper report did not have it seemed that after the deposition was taken as reported the colonel was told for the first time by his physicians that his wounds were mortal he appeared to be in great mental agony and fear and said he had not finished his deposition he added with great difficulty and long pauses these words i have not told all i must tell put it down i wronged her years ago i cant see o god i deserved that was all he fainted and did not revive again the washington railway conductor testified that the prisoner had asked him if a gentleman and his family went out on the evening train describing the persons he had since learned were col selby and family susan cullum colored servant at senator dilworthys was sworn knew col selby had seen him come to the house often and be alone in the parlor with miss hawkins he came the day but one before he was shot she let him in he appeared flustered like she heard talking in the parlor i peared like it was quarrelin was afeared sumfin was wrong just put her ear to the keyhole of the back parlordoor heard a mans voice i cant i cant good god quite beggin like heard young miss voice take your choice then if you bandon me you knows what to spect then he rushes outen the house i goes in and i says missis did you ring she was a standin like a tiger her eyes flashin i come right out this was the substance of susans testimony which was not shaken in the least by severe crossexamination in reply to mr brahams question if the prisoner did not look insane susan said lord no sir just mad as a hawnet washington hawkins was sworn the pistol identified by the officer as the one used in the homicide was produced washington admitted that it was his she had asked him for it one morning saying she thought she had heard burglars the night before admitted that he never had heard burglars in the house had anything unusual happened just before that nothing that he remembered did he accompany her to a reception at mrs shoonmakers a day or two before yes what occurred little by little it was dragged out of the witness that laura had behaved strangely there appeared to be sick and he had taken her home upon being pushed he admitted that she had afterwards confessed that she saw selby there and washington volunteered the statement that selby was a blackhearted villain the district attorney said with some annoyance there there that will do the defence declined to examine mr hawkins at present the case for the prosecution was closed of the murder there could not be the least doubt or that the prisoner followed the deceased to new york with a murderous intent on the evidence the jury must convict and might do so without leaving their seats this was the condition of the case two days after the jury had been selected a week had passed since the trial opened and a sunday had intervened the public who read the reports of the evidence saw no chance for the prisoners escape the crowd of spectators who had watched the trial were moved with the most profound sympathy for laura mr braham opened the case for the defence his manner was subdued and he spoke in so low a voice that it was only by reason of perfect silence in the court room that he could be heard he spoke very distinctly however and if his nationality could be discovered in his speech it was only in a certain richness and breadth of tone he began by saying that he trembled at the responsibility he had undertaken and he should altogether despair if he did not see before him a jury of twelve men of rare intelligence whose acute minds would unravel all the sophistries of the prosecution men with a sense of honor which would revolt at the remorseless persecution of this hunted woman by the state men with hearts to feel for the wrongs of which she was the victim far be it from him to cast any suspicion upon the motives of the able eloquent and ingenious lawyers of the state they act officially their business is to convict it is our business gentlemen to see that justice is done it is my duty gentlemen to untold to you one of the most affecting dramas in all the history of misfortune i shall have to show you a life the sport of fate and circumstances hurried along through shifting storm and sun bright with trusting innocence and anon black with heartless villainy a career which moves on in love and desertion and anguish always hovered over by the dark spectre of insanity an insanity hereditary and induced by mental torture until it ends if end it must in your verdict by one of those fearful accidents which are inscrutable to men and of which god alone knows the secret gentlemen i shall ask you to go with me away from this court room and its minions of the law away from the scene of this tragedy to a distant i wish i could say a happier day the story i have to tell is of a lovely little girl with sunny hair and laughing eyes traveling with her parents evidently people of wealth and refinement upon a mississippi steamboat there is an explosion one of those terrible catastrophes which leave the imprint of an unsettled mind upon the survivors hundreds of mangled remains are sent into eternity when the wreck is cleared away this sweet little girl is found among the panic stricken survivors in the midst of a scene of horror enough to turn the steadiest brain her parents have disappeared search even for their bodies is in vain the bewildered stricken child who can say what changes the fearful event wrought in her tender brain clings to the first person who shows her sympathy it is mrs hawkins this good lady who is still her loving friend laura is adopted into the hawkins family perhaps she forgets in time that she is not their child she is an orphan no gentlemen i will not deceive you she is not an orphan worse than that there comes another day of agony she knows that her father lives who is he where is he alas i cannot tell you through the scenes of this painful history he flits here and there a lunatic if he seeks his daughter it is the purposeless search of a lunatic as one who wanders bereft of reason crying where is my child laura seeks her father in vain just as she is about to find him again and againhe disappears he is gone he vanishes but this is only the prologue to the tragedy bear with me while i relate it mr braham takes out a handkerchief unfolds it slowly crashes it in his nervous hand and throws it on the table laura grew up in her humble southern home a beautiful creature the joy of the house the pride of the neighborhood the loveliest flower in all the sunny south she might yet have been happy she was happy but the destroyer came into this paradise he plucked the sweetest bud that grew there and having enjoyed its odor trampled it in the mire beneath his feet george selby the deceased a handsome accomplished confederate colonel was this human fiend he deceived her with a mock marriage after some months he brutally abandoned her and spurned her as if she were a contemptible thing all the time he had a wife in new orleans laura was crushed for weeks as i shall show you by the testimony of her adopted mother and brother she hovered over death in delirium gentlemen did she ever emerge from this delirium i shall show you that when she recovered her health her mind was changed she was not what she had been you can judge yourselves whether the tottering reason ever recovered its throne years pass she is in washington apparently the happy favorite of a brilliant society her family have become enormously rich by one of those sudden turns in fortune that the inhabitants of america are familiar with the discovery of immense mineral wealth in some wild lands owned by them she is engaged in a vast philanthropic scheme for the benefit of the poor by the use of this wealth but alas even here and now the same relentless fate pursued her the villain selby appears again upon the scene as if on purpose to complete the ruin of her life he appeared to taunt her with her dishonor he threatened exposure if she did not become again the mistress of his passion gentlemen do you wonder if this woman thus pursued lost her reason was beside herself with fear and that her wrongs preyed upon her mind until she was no longer responsible for her acts i turn away my head as one who would not willingly look even upon the just vengeance of heaven mr braham paused as if overcome by his emotions mrs hawkins and washington were in tears as were many of the spectators also the jury looked scared gentlemen in this condition of affairs it needed but a spark i do not say a suggestion i do not say a hint from this butterfly brierly this rejected rival to cause the explosion i make no charges but if this woman was in her right mind when she fled from washington and reached this city in company with brierly then i do not know what insanity is when mr braham sat down he felt that he had the jury with him a burst of applause followed which the officer promptly suppressed laura with tears in her eyes turned a grateful look upon her counsel all the women among the spectators saw the tears and wept also they thought as they also looked at mr braham how handsome he is mrs hawkins took the stand she was somewhat confused to be the target of so many eyes but her honest and good face at once told in lauras favor mrs hawkins said mr braham will you be kind enough to state the circumstances of your finding laura i object said mr mcflinn rising to his feet this has nothing whatever to do with the case your honor i am surprised at it even after the extraordinary speech of my learned friend how do you propose to connect it mr braham asked the judge if it please the court said mr braham rising impressively your honor has permitted the prosecution and i have submitted without a word to go into the most extraordinary testimony to establish a motive are we to be shut out from showing that the motive attributed to us could not by reason of certain mental conditions exist i purpose may it please your honor to show the cause and the origin of an aberration of mind to follow it up with other like evidence connecting it with the very moment of the homicide showing a condition of the intellect of the prisoner that precludes responsibility the state must insist upon its objections said the district attorney the purpose evidently is to open the door to a mass of irrelevant testimony the object of which is to produce an effect upon the jury your honor well understands perhaps suggested the judge the court ought to hear the testimony and exclude it afterwards if it is irrelevant will your honor hear argument on that certainly and argument his honor did hear or pretend to for two whole days from all the counsel in turn in the course of which the lawyers read contradictory decisions enough to perfectly establish both sides from volume after volume whole libraries in fact until no mortal man could say what the rules were the question of insanity in all its legal aspects was of course drawn into the discussion and its application affirmed and denied the case was felt to turn upon the admission or rejection of this evidence it was a sort of test trial of strength between the lawyers at the end the judge decided to admit the testimony as the judge usually does in such cases after a sufficient waste of time in what are called arguments mrs hawkins was allowed to go on chapter lvi mrs hawkins slowly and conscientiously as if every detail of her family history was important told the story of the steamboat explosion of the finding and adoption of laura silas that its mr hawkins and she always loved laura as if she had been their own child she then narrated the circumstances of lauras supposed marriage her abandonment and long illness in a manner that touched all hearts laura had been a different woman since then crossexamined at the time of first finding laura on the steamboat did she notice that lauras mind was at all deranged she couldnt say that she did after the recovery of laura from her long illness did mrs hawkins think there were any signs of insanity about her witness confessed that she did not think of it then redirect examination but she was different after that o yes sir washington hawkins corroborated his mothers testimony as to lauras connection with col selby he was at harding during the time of her living there with him after col selbys desertion she was almost dead never appeared to know anything rightly for weeks he added that he never saw such a scoundrel as selby checked by district attorney had he noticed any change in laura after her illness oh yes whenever any allusion was made that might recall selby to mind she looked awful as if she could kill him you mean said mr braham that there was an unnatural insane gleam in her eyes yes certainly said washington in confusion all this was objected to by the district attorney but it was got before the jury and mr braham did not care how much it was ruled out after that beriah sellers was the next witness called the colonel made his way to the stand with majestic yet bland deliberation having taken the oath and kissed the bible with a smack intended to show his great respect for that book he bowed to his honor with dignity to the jury with familiarity and then turned to the lawyers and stood in an attitude of superior attention mr sellers i believe began mr braham beriah sellers missouri was the courteous acknowledgment that the lawyer was correct mr sellers you know the parties here you are a friend of the family know them all from infancy sir it was me sir that induced silas hawkins judge hawkins to come to missouri and make his fortune it was by my advice and in company with me sir that he went into the operation of yes yes mr sellers did you know a major lackland knew him well sir knew him and honored him sir he was one of the most remarkable men of our country sir a member of congress he was often at my mansion sir for weeks he used to say to me col sellers if you would go into politics if i had you for a colleague we should show calhoun and webster that the brain of the country didnt lie east of the alleganies but i said yes yes i believe major lackland is not living colonel there was an almost imperceptible sense of pleasure betrayed in the colonels face at this prompt acknowledgment of his title bless you no died years ago a miserable death sir a ruined man a poor sot he was suspected of selling his vote in congress and probably he did the disgrace killed him he was an outcast sir loathed by himself and by his constituents and i think sir the judge you will confine yourself col sellers to the questions of the counsel of course your honor this continued the colonel in confidential explanation was twenty years ago i shouldnt have thought of referring to such a trifling circumstance now if i remember rightly sir a bundle of letters was here handed to the witness do you recognize that handwriting as if it was my own sir its major lacklands i was knowing to these letters when judge hawkins received them the colonels memory was a little at fault here mr hawkins had never gone into details with him on this subject he used to show them to me and say col sellers youve a mind to untangle this sort of thing lord how everything comes back to me laura was a little thing then the judge and i were just laying our plans to buy the pilot knob and colonel one moment your honor we put these letters in evidence the letters were a portion of the correspondence of major lackland with silas hawkins parts of them were missing and important letters were referred to that were not here they related as the reader knows to lauras father lackland had come upon the track of a man who was searching for a lost child in a mississippi steamboat explosion years before the man was lame in one leg and appeared to be flitting from place to place it seemed that major lackland got so close track of him that he was able to describe his personal appearance and learn his name but the letter containing these particulars was lost once he heard of him at a hotel in washington but the man departed leaving an empty trunk the day before the major went there there was something very mysterious in all his movements col sellers continuing his testimony said that he saw this lost letter but could not now recall the name search for the supposed father had been continued by lackland hawkins and himself for several years but laura was not informed of it till after the death of hawkins for fear of raising false hopes in her mind here the distract attorney arose and said your honor i must positively object to letting the witness wander off into all these irrelevant details mr braham i submit your honor that we cannot be interrupted in this manner we have suffered the state to have full swing now here is a witness who has known the prisoner from infancy and is competent to testify upon the one point vital to her safety evidently he is a gentleman of character and his knowledge of the case cannot be shut out without increasing the aspect of persecution which the states attitude towards the prisoner already has assumed the wrangle continued waxing hotter and hotter the colonel seeing the attention of the counsel and court entirely withdrawn from him thought he perceived here his opportunity turning and beaming upon the jury he began simply to talk but as the grandeur of his position grew upon him talk broadened unconsciously into an oratorical vein you see how she was situated gentlemen poor child it might have broken her heart to let her mind get to running on such a thing as that you see from what we could make out her father was lame in the left leg and had a deep scar on his left forehead and so ever since the day she found out she had another father she never could run across a lame stranger without being taken all over with a shiver and almost fainting where she stood and the next minute she would go right after that man once she stumbled on a stranger with a game leg and she was the most grateful thing in this world but it was the wrong leg and it was days and days before she could leave her bed once she found a man with a scar on his forehead and she was just going to throw herself into his arms but he stepped out just then and there wasnt anything the matter with his legs time and time again gentlemen of the jury has this poor suffering orphan flung herself on her knees with all her hearts gratitude in her eyes before some scarred and crippled veteran but always always to be disappointed always to be plunged into new despair if his legs were right his scar was wrong if his scar was right his legs were wrong never could find a man that would fill the bill gentlemen of the jury you have hearts you have feelings you have warm human sympathies you can feel for this poor suffering child gentlemen of the jury if i had time if i had the opportunity if i might be permitted to go on and tell you the thousands and thousands and thousands of mutilated strangers this poor girl has started out of cover and hunted from city to city from state to state from continent to continent till she has run them down and found they want the ones i know your hearts by this time the colonel had become so warmed up that his voice had reached a pitch above that of the contending counsel the lawyers suddenly stopped and they and the judge turned towards the colonel and remained far several seconds too surprised at this novel exhibition to speak in this interval of silence an appreciation of the situation gradually stole over the audience and an explosion of laughter followed in which even the court and the bar could hardly keep from joining sheriff order in the court the judge the witness will confine his remarks to answers to questions the colonel turned courteously to the judge and said certainly your honor certainly i am not well acquainted with the forms of procedure in the courts of new york but in the west sir in the west the judge there there that will do that will do you see your honor there were no questions asked me and i thought i would take advantage of the lull in the proceedings to explain to the jury a very significant train of the judge that will do sir proceed mr braham col sellers have you any reason to suppose that this man is still living every reason sir every reason state why i have never heard of his death sir it has never come to my knowledge in fact sir as i once said to governor will you state to the jury what has been the effect of the knowledge of this wandering and evidently unsettled being supposed to be her father upon the mind of miss hawkins for so many years question objected to question ruled out crossexamined major sellers what is your occupation the colonel looked about him loftily as if casting in his mind what would be the proper occupation of a person of such multifarious interests and then said with dignity a gentleman sir my father used to always say sir capt sellers did you ever see this man this supposed father no sir but upon one occasion old senator thompson said to me its my opinion colonel sellers did you ever see any body who had seen him no sir it was reported around at one time that that is all the defense then sent a day in the examination of medical experts in insanity who testified on the evidence heard that sufficient causes had occurred to produce an insane mind in the prisoner numerous cases were cited to sustain this opinion there was such a thing as momentary insanity in which the person otherwise rational to all appearances was for the time actually bereft of reason and not responsible for his acts the causes of this momentary possession could often be found in the persons life it afterwards came out that the chief expert for the defense was paid a thousand dollars for looking into the case the prosecution consumed another day in the examination of experts refuting the notion of insanity these causes might have produced insanity but there was no evidence that they have produced it in this case or that the prisoner was not at the time of the commission of the crime in full possession of her ordinary faculties the trial had now lasted two weeks it required four days now for the lawyers to sum up these arguments of the counsel were very important to their friends and greatly enhanced their reputation at the bar but they have small interest to us mr braham in his closing speech surpassed himself his effort is still remembered as the greatest in the criminal annals of new york mr braham redrew for the jury the picture of lauras early life he dwelt long upon that painful episode of the pretended marriage and the desertion col selby he said belonged gentlemen to what is called the upper classes it is the privilege of the upper classes to prey upon the sons and daughters of the people the hawkins family though allied to the best blood of the south were at the time in humble circumstances he commented upon her parentage perhaps her agonized father in his intervals of sanity was still searching for his lost daughter would he one day hear that she had died a felons death society had pursued her fate had pursued her and in a moment of delirium she had turned and defied fate and society he dwelt upon the admission of base wrong in col selbys dying statement he drew a vivid picture of the villain at last overtaken by the vengeance of heaven would the jury say that this retributive justice inflicted by an outraged and deluded woman rendered irrational by the most cruel wrongs was in the nature of a foul premeditated murder gentlemen it is enough for me to look upon the life of this most beautiful and accomplished of her sex blasted by the heartless villainy of man without seeing at theend of it the horrible spectacle of a gibbet gentlemen we are all human we have all sinned we all have need of mercy but i do not ask mercy of you who are the guardians of society and of the poor waifs its sometimes wronged victims i ask only that justice which you and i shall need in that last dreadful hour when death will be robbed of half its terrors if we can reflect that we have never wronged a human being gentlemen the life of this lovely and once happy girl this now stricken woman is in your hands the jury were risibly affected half the court room was in tears if a vote of both spectators and jury could have been taken then the verdict would have been let her go she has suffered enough but the district attorney had the closing argument calmly and without malice or excitement he reviewed the testimony as the cold facts were unrolled fear settled upon the listeners there was no escape from the murder or its premeditation lauras character as a lobbyist in washington which had been made to appear incidentally in the evidence was also against her the whole body of the testimony of the defense was shown to be irrelevant introduced only to excite sympathy and not giving a color of probability to the absurd supposition of insanity the attorney then dwelt upon the insecurity of life in the city and the growing immunity with which women committed murders mr mcflinn made a very able speech convincing the reason without touching the feelings the judge in his charge reviewed the testimony with great show of impartiality he ended by saying that the verdict must be acquittal or murder in the first degree if you find that the prisoner committed a homicide in possession of her reason and with premeditation your verdict will be accordingly if you find she was not in her right mind that she was the victim of insanity hereditary or momentary as it has been explained your verdict will take that into account as the judge finished his charge the spectators anxiously watched the faces of the jury it was not a remunerative study in the court room the general feeling was in favor of laura but whether this feeling extended to the jury their stolid faces did not reveal the public outside hoped for a conviction as it always does it wanted an example the newspapers trusted the jury would have the courage to do its duty when laura was convicted then the public would tern around and abuse the governor if he did not pardon her the jury went out mr braham preserved his serene confidence but lauras friends were dispirited washington and col sellers had been obliged to go to washington and they had departed under the unspoken fear the verdict would be unfavorable a disagreement was the best they could hope for and money was needed the necessity of the passage of the university bill was now imperative the court waited for some time but the jury gave no signs of coming in mr braham said it was extraordinary the court then took a recess for a couple of hours upon again coming in word was brought that the jury had not yet agreed but the jury had a question the point upon which they wanted instruction was this they wanted to know if col sellers was related to the hawkins family the court then adjourned till morning mr braham who was in something of a pet remarked to mr otoole that they must have been deceived that juryman with the broken nose could read chapter lvii the momentous day was at hand a day that promised to make or mar the fortunes of hawkins family for all time washington hawkins and col sellers were both up early for neither of them could sleep congress was expiring and was passing bill after bill as if they were gasps and each likely to be its last the university was on file for its third reading this day and tomorrow washington would be a millionaire and sellers no longer impecunious but this day also or at farthest the next the jury in lauras case would come to a decision of some kind or other they would find her guilty washington secretly feared and then the care and the trouble would all come back again and these would be wearing months of besieging judges for new trials on this day also the reelection of mr dilworthy to the senate would take place so washingtons mind was in a state of turmoil there were more interests at stake than it could handle with serenity he exulted when he thought of his millions he was filled with dread when he thought of laura but sellers was excited and happy he said everything is going right everythings going perfectly right pretty soon the telegrams will begin to rattle in and then youll see my boy let the jury do what they please what difference is it going to make tomorrow we can send a million to new york and set the lawyers at work on the judges bless your heart they will go before judge after judge and exhort and beseech and pray and shed tears they always do and they always win too and they will win this time they will get a writ of habeas corpus and a stay of proceedings and a supersedeas and a new trial and a nolle prosequi and there you are thats the routine and its no trick at all to a new york lawyer thats the regular routine everythings red tape and routine in the law you see its all greek to you of course but to a man who is acquainted with those things its mere ill explain it to you sometime everythings going to glide right along easy and comfortable now youll see washington youll see how it will be and then let me think dilwortby will be elected today and by day after tomorrow night be will be in new york ready to put in his shovel and you havent lived in washington all this time not to know that the people who walk right by a senator whose term is up without hardly seeing him will be down at the deepo to say welcome back and god bless you senator im glad to see you sir when he comes along back reelected you know well you see his influence was naturally running low when he left here but now he has got a new sixyears start and his suggestions will simply just weigh a couple of tons apiece day after tomorrow lord bless you he could rattle through that habeas corpus and supersedeas and all those things for laura all by himself if he wanted to when he gets back i hadnt thought of that said washington brightening but it is so a newlyelected senator is a power i know that yes indeed he is why it is just human nature look at me when we first came here i was mr sellers and major sellers captain sellers but nobody could ever get it right somehow but the minute our bill went through the house i was col sellers every time and nobody could do enough for me and whatever i said was wonderful sir it was always wonderful i never seemed to say any flat things at all it was colonel wont you come and dine with us and colonel why dont we ever see you at our house and the colonel says this and the colonel says that and we know suchandsuch is soandso because my husband heard col sellers say so dont you see well the senate adjourned and left our bill high and dry and ill be hanged if i warnt old sellers from that day till our bill passed the house again last week now im the colonel again and if i were to eat all the dinners i am invited to i reckon id wear my teeth down level with my gums in a couple of weeks well i do wonder what you will be tomorrow colonel after the president signs the bill general sir general without a doubt yes sir tomorrow it will be general let me congratulate you sir general youve done a great work sir youve done a great work for the niggro gentlemen allow me the honor to introduce my friend general sellers the humane friend of the niggro lord bless me youll see the newspapers say general sellers and servants arrived in the city last night and is stopping at the fifth avenue and general sellers has accepted a reception and banquet by the cosmopolitan club youll see the generals opinions quoted too and what the general has to say about the propriety of a new trial and a habeas corpus for the unfortunate miss hawkins will not be without weight in influential quarters i can tell you and i want to be the first to shake your faithful old hand and salute you with your new honors and i want to do it now general said washington suiting the action to the word and accompanying it with all the meaning that a cordial grasp and eloquent eyes could give it the colonel was touched he was pleased and proud too his face answered for that not very long after breakfast the telegrams began to arrive the first was from braham and ran thus we feel certain that the verdict will be rendered today be it good or bad let it find us ready to make the next move instantly whatever it may be thats the right talk said sellers that grahams a wonderful man he was the only man there that really understood me he told me so himself afterwards the next telegram was from mr dilworthy i have not only brought over the great invincible but through him a dozen more of the opposition shall be reelected today by an overwhelming majority good again said the colonel that mans talent for organization is something marvelous he wanted me to go out there and engineer that thing but i said no dilworthy i must be on hand here both on lauras account and the bills but youve no trifling genius for organization yourself said i and i was right you go ahead said i you can fix it and so he has but i claim no credit for that if i stiffened up his backbone a little i simply put him in the way to make his fight didnt undertake it myself he has captured noble i consider that a splendid piece of diplomacy splendid sir by and by came another dispatch from new york jury still out laura calm and firm as a statue the report that the jury have brought her in guilty is false and premature premature gasped washington turning white then they all expect that sort of a verdict when it comes in and so did he but he had not had courage enough to put it into words he had been preparing himself for the worst but after all his preparation the bare suggestion of the possibility of such a verdict struck him cold as death the friends grew impatient now the telegrams did not come fast enough even the lightning could not keep up with their anxieties they walked the floor talking disjointedly and listening for the doorbell telegram after telegram came still no result by and by there was one which contained a single line court now coming in after brief recess to hear verdict jury ready oh i wish they would finish said washington this suspense is killing me by inches then came another telegram another hitch somewhere jury want a little more time and further instructions well well well this is trying said the colonel and after a pause no dispatch from dilworthy for two hours now even a dispatch from him would be better than nothing just to vary this thing they waited twenty minutes it seemed twenty hours come said washington i cant wait for the telegraph boy to come all the way up here lets go down to newspaper row meet him on the way while they were passing along the avenue they saw someone putting up a great displaysheet on the bulletin board of a newspaper office and an eager crowd of men was collecting abort the place washington and the colonel ran to the spot and read this tremendous sensation startling news from saints rest on first ballot for u s senator when voting was about to begin mr noble rose in his place and drew forth a package walked forward and laid it on the speakers desk saying this contains in bank bills and was given me by senator dilworthy in his bedchamber at midnight last night to buy my vote for him i wish the speaker to count the money and retain it to pay the expense of prosecuting this infamous traitor for bribery the whole legislature was stricken speechless with dismay and astonishment noble further said that there were fifty members present with money in their pockets placed there by dilworthy to buy their votes amidst unparalleled excitement the ballot was now taken and j w smith elected u s senator dilworthy receiving not one vote noble promises damaging exposures concerning dilworthy and certain measures of his now pending in congress good heavens and earth exclaimed the colonel to the capitol said washington fly and they did fly long before they got there the newsboys were running ahead of them with extras hot from the press announcing the astounding news arrived in the gallery of the senate the friends saw a curious spectacle very senator held an extra in his hand and looked as interested as if it contained news of the destruction of the earth not a single member was paying the least attention to the business of the hour the secretary in a loud voice was just beginning to read the title of a bill housebill no anacttofoundandincorporatethe knobsindustrialuniversity readfirstandsecondtimeconsideredincommitteeofthewholeorderedengrossed andpassedtothirdreadingandfinal passage the president third reading of the bill the two friends shook in their shoes senators threw down their extras and snatched a word or two with each other in whispers then the gavel rapped to command silence while the names were called on the ayes and nays washington grew paler and paler weaker and weaker while the lagging list progressed and when it was finished his head fell helplessly forward on his arms the fight was fought the long struggle was over and he was a pauper not a man had voted for the bill col sellers was bewildered and well nigh paralyzed himself but no man could long consider his own troubles in the presence of such suffering as washingtons he got him up and supported him almost carried him indeed out of the building and into a carriage all the way home washington lay with his face against the colonels shoulder and merely groaned and wept the colonel tried as well as he could under the dreary circumstances to hearten him a little but it was of no use washington was past all hope of cheer now he only said oh it is all over it is all over for good colonel we must beg our bread now we never can get up again it was our last chance and it is gone they will hang laura my god they will hang her nothing can save the poor girl now oh i wish with all my soul they would hang me instead arrived at home washington fell into a chair and buried his face in his hands and gave full way to his misery the colonel did not know where to turn nor what to do the servant maid knocked at the door and passed in a telegram saying it had come while they were gone the colonel tore it open and read with the voice of a manofwars broadside verdict of jury not guilty and laura is free chapter lviii the court room was packed on the morning on which the verdict of the jury was expected as it had been every day of the trial and by the same spectators who had followed its progress with such intense interest there is a delicious moment of excitement which the frequenter of trials well knows and which he would not miss for the world it is that instant when the foreman of the jury stands up to give the verdict and before he has opened his fateful lips the court assembled and waited it was an obstinate jury it even had another question this intelligent jury to ask the judge this morning the question was this were the doctors clear that the deceased had no disease which might soon have carried him off if he had not been shot there was evidently one jury man who didnt want to waste life and was willing to stake a general average as the jury always does in a civil case deciding not according to the evidence but reaching the verdict by some occult mental process during the delay the spectators exhibited unexampled patience finding amusement and relief in the slightest movements of the court the prisoner and the lawyers mr braham divided with laura the attention of the house bets were made by the sheriffs deputies on the verdict with large odds in favor of a disagreement it was afternoon when it was announced that the jury was coming in the reporters took their places and were all attention the judge and lawyers were in their seats the crowd swayed and pushed in eager expectancy as the jury walked in and stood up in silence judge gentlemen have you agreed upon your verdict foreman we have judge what is it foreman not guilty a shout went up from the entire room and a tumult of cheering which the court in vain attempted to quell for a few moments all order was lost the spectators crowded within the bar and surrounded laura who calmer than anyone else was supporting her aged mother who had almost fainted from excess of joy and now occurred one of those beautiful incidents which no fictionwriter would dare to imagine a scene of touching pathos creditable to our fallen humanity in the eyes of the women of the audience mr braham was the hero of the occasion he had saved the life of the prisoner and besides he was such a handsome man the women could not restrain their long pentup emotions they threw themselves upon mr braham in a transport of gratitude they kissed him again and again the young as well as the advanced in years the married as well as the ardent single women they improved the opportunity with a touching selfsacrifice in the words of a newspaper of the day they lavished him with kisses it was something sweet to do and it would be sweet for a woman to remember in after years that she had kissed braham mr braham himself received these fond assaults with the gallantry of his nation enduring the ugly and heartily paying back beauty in its own coin this beautiful scene is still known in new york as the kissing of braham when the tumult of congratulation had a little spent itself and order was restored judge oshaunnessy said that it now became his duty to provide for the proper custody and treatment of the acquitted the verdict of the jury having left no doubt that the woman was of an unsound mind with a kind of insanity dangerous to the safety of the community she could not be permitted to go at large in accordance with the directions of the law in such cases said the judge and in obedience to the dictates of a wise humanity i hereby commit laura hawkins to the care of the superintendent of the state hospital for insane criminals to be held in confinement until the state commissioners on insanity shall order her discharge mr sheriff you will attend at once to the execution of this decree laura was overwhelmed and terrorstricken she had expected to walk forth in freedom in a few moments the revulsion was terrible her mother appeared like one shaken with an ague fit laura insane and about to be locked up with madmen she had never contemplated this mr graham said he should move at once for a writ of habeas corpus but the judge could not do less than his duty the law must have its way as in the stupor of a sudden calamity and not fully comprehending it mrs hawkins saw laura led away by the officer with little space for thought she was rapidly driven to the railway station and conveyed to the hospital for lunatic criminals it was only when she was within this vast and grim abode of madness that she realized the horror of her situation it was only when she was received by the kind physician and read pity in his eyes and saw his look of hopeless incredulity when she attempted to tell him that she was not insane it was only when she passed through the ward to which she was consigned and saw the horrible creatures the victims of a double calamity whose dreadful faces she was hereafter to see daily and was locked into the small bare room that was to be her home that all her fortitude forsook her she sank upon the bed as soon as she was left alone she had been searched by the matron and tried to think but her brain was in a whirl she recalled brahams speech she recalled the testimony regarding her lunacy she wondered if she were not mad she felt that she soon should be among these loathsome creatures better almost to have died than to slowly go mad in this confinement we beg the readers pardon this is not history which has just been written it is really what would have occurred if this were a novel if this were a work of fiction we should not dare to dispose of laura otherwise true art and any attention to dramatic proprieties required it the novelist who would turn loose upon society an insane murderess could not escape condemnation besides the safety of society the decencies of criminal procedure what we call our modern civilization all would demand that laura should be disposed of in the manner we have described foreigners who read this sad story will be unable to understand any other termination of it but this is history and not fiction there is no such law or custom as that to which his honor is supposed to have referred judge oshaunnessy would not probably pay any attention to it if there were there is no hospital for insane criminals there is no state commission of lunacy what actually occurred when the tumult in the court room had subsided the sagacious reader will now learn laura left the court room accompanied by her mother and other friends amid the congratulations of those assembled and was cheered as she entered a carriage and drove away how sweet was the sunlight how exhilarating the sense of freedom were not these following cheers the expression of popular approval and affection was she not the heroine of the hour it was with a feeling of triumph that laura reached her hotel a scornful feeling of victory over society with its own weapons mrs hawkins shared not at all in this feeling she was broken with the disgrace and the long anxiety thank god laura she said it is over now we will go away from this hateful city let us go home at once mother replied laura speaking with some tenderness i cannot go with you there dont cry i cannot go back to that life mrs hawkins was sobbing this was more cruel than anything else for she had a dim notion of what it would be to leave laura to herself no mother you have been everything to me you know how dearly i love you but i cannot go back a boy brought in a telegraphic despatch laura took it and read the bill is lost dilworthy ruined signed washington for a moment the words swam before her eyes the next her eyes flashed fire as she handed the dispatch to her m other and bitterly said the world is against me well let it be let it i am against it this is a cruel disappointment said mrs hawkins to whom one grief more or less did not much matter now to you and washington but we must humbly bear it bear it replied laura scornfully ive all my life borne it and fate has thwarted me at every step a servant came to the door to say that there was a gentleman below who wished to speak with miss hawkins j adolphe griller was the name laura read on the card i do not know such a person he probably comes from washington send him up mr griller entered he was a small man slovenly in dress his tone confidential his manner wholly void of animation all his features below the forehead protruding particularly the apple of his throat hair without a kink in it a hand with no grip a meek hangdog countenance a falsehood done in flesh and blood for while every visible sign about him proclaimed him a poor witless useless weakling the truth was that he had the brains to plan great enterprises and the pluck to carry them through that was his reputation and it was a deserved one he softly said i called to see you on business miss hawkins you have my card laura bowed mr griller continued to purr as softly as before i will proceed to business i am a business man i am a lectureagent miss hawkins and as soon as i saw that you were acquitted it occurred to me that an early interview would be mutually beneficial i dont understand you sir said laura coldly no you see miss hawkins this is your opportunity if you will enter the lecture field under good auspices you will carry everything before you but sir i never lectured i havent any lecture i dont know anything about it ah madam that makes no difference no real difference it is not necessary to be able to lecture in order to go into the lecture tour if ones name is celebrated all over the land especially and if she is also beautiful she is certain to draw large audiences but what should i lecture about asked laura beginning in spite of herself to be a little interested as well as amused oh why woman something about woman i should say the marriage relation womans fate anything of that sort call it the revelations of a womans life now theres a good title i wouldnt want any better title than that im prepared to make you an offer miss hawkins a liberal offer twelve thousand dollars for thirty nights laura thought she hesitated why not it would give her employment money she must do something i will think of it and let you know soon but still there is very little likelihood that i however we will not discuss it further now remember that the sooner we get to work the better miss hawkins public curiosity is so fickle good day madam the close of the trial released mr harry brierly and left him free to depart upon his long talked of pacificcoast mission he was very mysterious about it even to philip its confidential old boy he said a little scheme we have hatched up i dont mind telling you that its a good deal bigger thing than that in missouri and a sure thing i wouldnt take a half a million just for my share and it will open something for you phil you will hear from me philip did hear from harry a few months afterward everything promised splendidly but there was a little delay could phil let him have a hundred say for ninety days philip himself hastened to philadelphia and as soon as the spring opened to the mine at ilium and began transforming the loan he had received from squire montague into laborers wages he was haunted with many anxieties in the first place ruth was overtaxing her strength in her hospital labors and philip felt as if he must move heaven and earth to save her from such toil and suffering his increased pecuniary obligation oppressed him it seemed to him also that he had been one cause of the misfortune to the bolton family and that he was dragging into loss and ruin everybody who associated with him he worked on day after day and week after week with a feverish anxiety it would be wicked thought philip and impious to pray for luck he felt that perhaps he ought not to ask a blessing upon the sort of labor that was only a venture but yet in that daily petition which this very faulty and not very consistent young christian gentleman put up he prayed earnestly enough for ruth and for the boltons and for those whom he loved and who trusted in him and that his life might not be a misfortune to them and a failure to himself since this young fellow went out into the world from his new england home he had done some things that he would rather his mother should not know things maybe that he would shrink from telling ruth at a certain green age young gentlemen are sometimes afraid of being called milksops and philips associates had not always been the most select such as these historians would have chosen for him or whom at a later period he would have chosen for himself it seemed inexplicable for instance that his life should have been thrown so much with his college acquaintance henry brierly yet this was true of philip that in whatever company he had been he had never been ashamed to stand up for the principles he learned from his mother and neither raillery nor looks of wonder turned him from that daily habit had learned at his mothers knees even flippant harry respected this and perhaps it was one of the reasons why harry and all who knew philip trusted him implicitly and yet it must be confessed that philip did not convey the impression to the world of a very serious young man or of a man who might not rather easily fall into temptation one looking for a real hero would have to go elsewhere the parting between laura and her mother was exceedingly painful to both it was as if two friends parted on a wide plain the one to journey towards the setting and the other towards the rising sun each comprehending that every step henceforth must separate their lives wider and wider chapter lix when mr nobles bombshell fell in senator dilworthys camp the statesman was disconcerted for a moment for a moment that was all the next moment he was calmly up and doing from the centre of our country to its circumference nothing was talked of but mr nobles terrible revelation and the people were furious mind they were not furious because bribery was uncommon in our public life but merely because here was another case perhaps it did not occur to the nation of good and worthy people that while they continued to sit comfortably at home and leave the true source of our political power the primaries in the hands of saloonkeepers dogfanciers and hodcarriers they could go on expecting another case of this kind and even dozens and hundreds of them and never be disappointed however they may have thought that to sit at home and grumble would some day right the evil yes the nation was excited but senator dilworthy was calm what was left of him after the explosion of the shell calm and up and doing what did he do first what would you do first after you had tomahawked your mother at the breakfast table for putting too much sugar in your coffee you would ask for a suspension of public opinion that is what senator dilworthy did it is the custom he got the usual amount of suspension far and wide he was called a thief a briber a promoter of steamship subsidies railway swindles robberies of the government in all possible forms and fashions newspapers and everybody else called him a pious hypocrite a sleek oily fraud a reptile who manipulated temperance movements prayer meetings sunday schools public charities missionary enterprises all for his private benefit and as these charges were backed up by what seemed to be good and sufficient evidence they were believed with national unanimity then mr dilworthy made another move he moved instantly to washington and demanded an investigation even this could not pass without comment many papers used language to this effect senator dilworthys remains have demanded an investigation this sounds fine and bold and innocent but when we reflect that they demand it at the hands of the senate of the united states it simply becomes matter for derision one might as well set the gentlemen detained in the public prisons to trying each other this investigation is likely to be like all other senatorial investigations amusing but not useful query why does the senate still stick to this pompous word investigation one does not blindfold ones self in order to investigate an object mr dilworthy appeared in his place in the senate and offered a resolution appointing a committee to investigate his case it carried of course and the committee was appointed straightway the newspapers said under the guise of appointing a committee to investigate the late mr dilworthy the senate yesterday appointed a committee to investigate his accuser mr noble this is the exact spirit and meaning of the resolution and the committee cannot try anybody but mr noble without overstepping its authority that dilworthy had the effrontery to offer such a resolution will surprise no one and that the senate could entertain it without blushing and pass it without shame will surprise no one we are now reminded of a note which we have received from the notorious burglar murphy in which he finds fault with a statement of ours to the effect that he had served one term in the penitentiary and also one in the u s senate he says the latter statement is untrue and does me great injustice after an unconscious sarcasm like that further comment is unnecessary and yet the senate was roused by the dilworthy trouble many speeches were made one senator who was accused in the public prints of selling his chances of reelection to his opponent for and had not yet denied the charge said that the presence in the capital of such a creature as this man noble to testify against a brother member of their body was an insult to the senate another senator said let the investigation go on and let it make an example of this man noble let it teach him and men like him that they could not attack the reputation of a united statessenator with impunity another said he was glad the investigation was to be had for it was high time that the senate should crush some cur like this man noble and thus show his kind that it was able and resolved to uphold its ancient dignity a bystander laughed at this finely delivered peroration and said why this is the senator who franked his baggage home through the mails last weekregistered at that however perhaps he was merely engaged in upholding the ancient dignity of the senate then no the modern dignity of it said another bystander it dont resemble its ancient dignity but it fits its modern style like a glove there being no law against making offensive remarks about u s senators this conversation and others like it continued without let or hindrance but our business is with the investigating committee mr noble appeared before the committee of the senate and testified to the following effect he said that he was a member of the state legislature of the happylandofcanaan that on the day ofhe assembled himself together at the city of saints rest the capital of the state along with his brother legislators that he was known to be a political enemy of mr dilworthy and bitterly opposed to his reelection that mr dilworthy came to saints rest and reported to be buying pledges of votes with money that the said dilworthy sent for him to come to his room in the hotel at night and he went was introduced to mr dilworthy called two or three times afterward at dilworthys request usually after midnight mr dilworthy urged him to vote for him noble declined dilworthy argued said he was bound to be elected and could then ruin him noble if he voted no said he had every railway and every public office and stronghold of political power in the state under his thumb and could set up or pull down any man he chose gave instances showing where and how he had used this power if noble would vote for him he would make him a representative in congress noble still declined to vote and said he did not believe dilworthy was going to be elected dilworthy showed a list of men who would vote for him a majority of the legislature gave further proofs of his power by telling noble everything the opposing party had done or said in secret caucus claimed that his spies reported everything to him and that here a member of the committee objected that this evidence was irrelevant and also in opposition to the spirit of the committees instructions because if these things reflected upon any one it was upon mr dilworthy the chairman said let the person proceed with his statement the committee could exclude evidence that did not bear upon the case mr noble continued he said that his party would cast him out if he voted for mr dilworthy dilwortby said that that would inure to his benefit because he would then be a recognized friend of his dilworthys and he could consistently exalt him politically and make his fortune noble said he was poor and it was hard to tempt him so dilworthy said he would fix that he said tell me what you want and say you will vote for me noble could not say dilworthy said i will give you a committee man said impatiently that this stuff was all outside the case and valuable time was being wasted this was all a plain reflection upon a brother senator the chairman said it was the quickest way to proceed and the evidence need have no weight mr noble continued he said he told dilworthy that was not much to pay for a mans honor character and everything that was worth having dilworthy said he was surprised he considered a fortune for some men asked what nobles figure was noble said he could not think too little dilworthy said it was a great deal too much he would not do it for any other man but he had conceived a liking for noble and where he liked a man his heart yearned to help him he was aware that noble was poor and had a family to support and that he bore an unblemished reputation at home for such a man and such a mans influence he could do much and feel that to help such a man would be an act that would have its reward the struggles of the poor always touched him he believed that noble would make a good use of this money and that it would cheer many a sad heart and needy home he would give the all he desired in return was that when the balloting began noble should cast his vote for him and should explain to the legislature that upon looking into the charges against mr dilworthy of bribery corruption and forwarding stealing measures in congress he had found them to be base calumnies upon a man whose motives were pure and whose character was stainless he then took from his pocket in bank bills and handed them to noble and got another package containing out of his trunk and gave to him also he a committee man jumped up and said at last mr chairman this shameless person has arrived at the point this is sufficient and conclusive by his own confession he has received a bribe and did it deliberately this is a grave offense and cannot be passed over in silence sir by the terms of our instructions we can now proceed to mete out to him such punishment as is meet for one who has maliciously brought disrespect upon a senator of the united states we have no need to hear the rest of his evidence the chairman said it would be better and more regular to proceed with the investigation according to the usual forms a note would be made of mr nobles admission mr noble continued he said that it was now far past midnight that he took his leave and went straight to certain legislators told them everything made them count the money and also told them of the exposure he would make in joint convention he made that exposure as all the world knew the rest of the was to be paid the day after dilworthy was elected senator dilworthy was now asked to take the stand and tell what he knew about the man noble the senator wiped his mouth with his handkerchief adjusted his white cravat and said that but for the fact that public morality required an example for the warning of future nobles he would beg that in christian charity this poor misguided creature might be forgiven and set free he said that it was but too evident that this person had approached him in the hope of obtaining a bribe he had intruded himself time and again and always with moving stories of his poverty mr dilworthy said that his heart had bled for him insomuch that he had several times been on the point of trying to get some one to do something for him some instinct had told him from the beginning that this was a bad man an evilminded man but his inexperience of such had blinded him to his real motives and hence he had never dreamed that his object was to undermine the purity of a united states senator he regretted that it was plain now that such was the mans object and that punishment could not with safety to the senates honor be withheld he grieved to say that one of those mysterious dispensations of an inscrutable providence which are decreed from time to time by his wisdom and for his righteous purposes had given this conspirators tale a color of plausibility but this would soon disappear under the clear light of truth which would now be thrown upon the case it so happened said the senator that about the time in question a poor young friend of mine living in a distant town of my state wished to establish a bank he asked me to lend him the necessary money i said i had no money just then but world try to borrow it the day before the election a friend said to me that my election expenses must be very large specially my hotel bills and offered to lend me some money remembering my young friend i said i would like a few thousands now and a few more by and by whereupon he gave me two packages of bills said to contain and respectively i did not open the packages or count the money i did not give any note or receipt for the same i made no memorandum of the transaction and neither did my friend that night this evil man noble came troubling me again i could not rid myself of him though my time was very precious he mentioned my young friend and said he was very anxious to have the now to begin his banking operations with and could wait a while for the rest noble wished to get the money and take it to him i finally gave him the two packages of bills i took no note or receipt from him and made no memorandum of the matter i no more look for duplicity and deception in another man than i would look for it in myself i never thought of this man again until i was overwhelmed the next day by learning what a shameful use he had made of the confidence i had reposed in him and the money i had entrusted to his care this is all gentlemen to the absolute truth of every detail of my statement i solemnly swear and i call him to witness who is the truth and the loving father of all whose lips abhor false speaking i pledge my honor as a senator that i have spoken but the truth may god forgive this wicked man as i do mr noble senator dilworthy your bank account shows that up to that day and even on that very day you conducted all your financial business through the medium of checks instead of bills and so kept careful record of every moneyed transaction why did you deal in bank bills on this particular occasion the chairman the gentleman will please to remember that the committee is conducting this investigation mr noble then will the committee ask the question the chairman the committee will when it desires to know mr noble which will not be daring this century perhaps the chairman another remark like that sir will procure you the attentions of the sergeantatarms mr noble d n the sergeantatarms and the committee too several committeemen mr chairman this is contempt mr noble contempt of whom of the committee of the senate of the united states mr noble then i am become the acknowledged representative of a nation you know as well as i do that the whole nation hold as much as threefifths of the united states senate in entire contempt threefifths of you are dilworthys the sergeantatarms very soon put a quietus upon the observations of the representative of the nation and convinced him that he was not in the overfree atmosphere of his happylandofcanaan the statement of senator dilworthy naturally carried conviction to the minds of the committee it was close logical unanswerable it bore many internal evidences of its truth for instance it is customary in all countries for business men to loan large sums of money in bank bills instead of checks it is customary for the lender to make no memorandum of the transaction it is customary for the borrower to receive the money without making a memorandum of it or giving a note or a receipt for its use the borrower is not likely to die or forget about it it is customary to lend nearly anybody money to start a bank with especially if you have not the money to lend him and have to borrow it for the purpose it is customary to carry large sums of money in bank bills about your person or in your trunk it is customary to hand a large sure in bank bills to a man you have just been introduced to if he asks you to do it to be conveyed to a distant town and delivered to another party it is not customary to make a memorandum of this transaction it is not customary for the conveyor to give a note or a receipt for the money it is not customary to require that he shall get a note or a receipt from the man he is to convey it to in the distant town it would be at least singular in you to say to the proposed conveyor you might be robbed i will deposit the money in a bank and send a check for it to my friend through the mail very well it being plain that senator dilworthys statement was rigidly true and this fact being strengthened by his adding to it the support of his honor as a senator the committee rendered a verdict of not proven that a bribe had been offered and accepted this in a manner exonerated noble and let him escape the committee made its report to the senate and that body proceeded to consider its acceptance one senator indeed several senators objected that the committee had failed of its duty they had proved this man noble guilty of nothing they had meted out no punishment to him if the report were accepted he would go forth free and scathless glorying in his crime and it would be a tacit admission that any blackguard could insult the senate of the united states and conspire against the sacred reputation of its members with impunity the senate owed it to the upholding of its ancient dignity to make an example of this man noble he should be crushed an elderly senator got up and took another view of the case this was a senator of the wornout and obsolete pattern a man still lingering among the cobwebs of the past and behind the spirit of the age he said that there seemed to be a curious misunderstanding of the case gentlemen seemed exceedingly anxious to preserve and maintain the honor and dignity of the senate was this to be done by trying an obscure adventurer for attempting to trap a senator into bribing him or would not the truer way be to find out whether the senator was capable of being entrapped into so shameless an act and then try him why of course now the whole idea of the senate seemed to be to shield the senator and turn inquiry away from him the true way to uphold the honor of the senate was to have none but honorable men in its body if this senator had yielded to temptation and had offered a bribe he was a soiled man and ought to be instantly expelled therefore he wanted the senator tried and not in the usual nambypamby way but in good earnest he wanted to know the truth of this matter for himself he believed that the guilt of senator dilworthy was established beyond the shadow of a doubt and he considered that in trifling with his case and shirking it the senate was doing a shameful and cowardly thing a thing which suggested that in its willingness to sit longer in the company of such a man it was acknowledging that it was itself of a kind with him and was therefore not dishonored by his presence he desired that a rigid examination be made into senator dilworthys case and that it be continued clear into the approaching extra session if need be there was no dodging this thing with the lame excuse of want of time in reply an honorable senator said that he thought it would be as well to drop the matter and accept the committees report he said with some jocularity that the more one agitated this thing the worse it was for the agitator he was not able to deny that he believed senator dilworthy to be guilty but what then was it such an extraordinary case for his part even allowing the senator to be guilty he did not think his continued presence during the few remaining days of the session would contaminate the senate to a dreadful degree this humorous sally was received with smiling admiration notwithstanding it was not wholly new having originated with the massachusetts general in the house a day or two before upon the occasion of the proposed expulsion of a member for selling his vote for money the senate recognized the fact that it could not be contaminated by sitting a few days longer with senator dilworthy and so it accepted the committees report and dropped the unimportant matter mr dilworthy occupied his seat to the last hour of the session he said that his people had reposed a trust in him and it was not for him to desert them he would remain at his post till he perished if need be his voice was lifted up and his vote cast for the last time in support of an ingenious measure contrived by the general from massachusetts whereby the presidents salary was proposed to be doubled and every congressman paid several thousand dollars extra for work previously done under an accepted contract and already paid for once and receipted for senator dilworthy was offered a grand ovation by his friends at home who said that their affection for him and their confidence in him were in no wise impaired by the persecutions that had pursued him and that he was still good enough for them the left by mr noble with his state legislature was placed in safe keeping to await the claim of the legitimate owner senator dilworthy made one little effort through his protege the embryo banker to recover it but there being no notes of hand or other memoranda to support the claim it failed the moral of which is that when one loans money to start a bank with one ought to take the partys written acknowledgment of the fact chapter lx for some days laura had been a free woman once more during this time she had experienced first two or three days of triumph excitement congratulations a sort of sunburst of gladness after a long night of gloom and anxiety then two or three days of calming down by degrees a receding of tides a quieting of the stormwash to a murmurous surfbeat a diminishing of devastating winds to a refrain that bore the spirit of a trucedays given to solitude rest selfcommunion and the reasoning of herself into a realization of the fact that she was actually done with bolts and bars prison horrors and impending death then came a day whose hours filed slowly by her each laden with some remnant some remaining fragment of the dreadful time so lately ended a day which closing at last left the past a fading shore behind her and turned her eyes toward the broad sea of the future so speedily do we put the dead away and come back to our place in the ranks to march in the pilgrimage of life again and now the sun rose once more and ushered in the first day of what laura comprehended and accepted as a new life the past had sunk below the horizon and existed no more for her she was done with it for all time she was gazing out over the trackless expanses of the future now with troubled eyes life must be begun again at eight and twenty years of age and where to begin the page was blank and waiting for its first record so this was indeed a momentous day her thoughts drifted back stage by stage over her career as far as the long highway receded over the plain of her life it was lined with the gilded and pillared splendors of her ambition all crumbled to ruin and ivygrown every milestone marked a disaster there was no green spot remaining anywhere in memory of a hope that had found its fruition the unresponsive earth had uttered no voice of flowers in testimony that one who was blest had gone that road her life had been a failure that was plain she said no more of that she would now look the future in the face she would mark her course upon the chart of life and follow it follow it without swerving through rocks and shoals through storm and calm to a haven of rest and peace or shipwreck let the end be what it might she would mark her course now today and follow it on her table lay six or seven notes they were from lovers from some of the prominent names in the land men whose devotion had survived even the grisly revealments of her character which the courts had uncurtained men who knew her now just as she was and yet pleaded as for their lives for the dear privilege of calling the murderess wife as she read these passionate these worshiping these supplicating missives the woman in her nature confessed itself a strong yearning came upon her to lay her head upon a loyal breast and find rest from the conflict of life solace for her griefs the healing of love for her bruised heart with her forehead resting upon her hand she sat thinking thinking while the unheeded moments winged their flight it was one of those mornings in early spring when nature seems just stirring to a half consciousness out of a long exhausting lethargy when the first faint balmy airs go wandering about whispering the secret of the coming change when the abused brown grass newly relieved of snow seems considering whether it can be worth the trouble and worry of contriving its green raiment again only to fight the inevitable fight with the implacable winter and be vanquished and buried once more when the sun shines out and a few birds venture forth and lift up a forgotten song when a strange stillness and suspense pervades the waiting air it is a time when ones spirit is subdued and sad one knows not why when the past seems a stormswept desolation life a vanity and a burden and the future but a way to death it is a time when one is filled with vague longings when one dreams of flight to peaceful islands in the remote solitudes of the sea or folds his hands and says what is the use of struggling and toiling and worrying any more let us give it all up it was into such a mood as this that laura had drifted from the musings which the letters of her lovers had called up now she lifted her head and noted with surprise how the day had wasted she thrust the letters aside rose up and went and stood at the window but she was soon thinking again and was only gazing into vacancy by and by she turned her countenance had cleared the dreamy look was gone out of her face all indecision had vanished the poise of her head and the firm set of her lips told that her resolution was formed she moved toward the table with all the old dignity in her carriage and all the old pride in her mien she took up each letter in its turn touched a match to it and watched it slowly consume to ashes then she said i have landed upon a foreign shore and burned my ships behind me these letters were the last thing that held me in sympathy with any remnant or belonging of the old life henceforth that life and all that appertains to it are as dead to me and as far removed from me as if i were become a denizen of another world she said that love was not for her the time that it could have satisfied her heart was gone by and could not return the opportunity was lost nothing could restore it she said there could be no love without respect and she would only despise a man who could content himself with a thing like her love she said was a womans first necessity love being forfeited there was but one thing left that could give a passing zest to a wasted life and that was fame admiration the applause of the multitude and so her resolution was taken she would turn to that final resort of the disappointed of her sex the lecture platform she would array herself in fine attire she would adorn herself with jewels and stand in her isolated magnificence before massed audiences and enchant them with her eloquence and amaze them with her unapproachable beauty she would move from city to city like a queen of romance leaving marveling multitudes behind her and impatient multitudes awaiting her coming her life during one hour of each day upon the platform would be a rapturous intoxication and when the curtain fell and the lights were out and the people gone to nestle in their homes and forget her she would find in sleep oblivion of her homelessness if she could if not she would brave out the night in solitude and wait for the next days hour of ecstasy so to take up life and begin again was no great evil she saw her way she would be brave and strong she would make the best of what was left for her among the possibilities she sent for the lecture agent and matters were soon arranged straightway all the papers were filled with her name and all the dead walls flamed with it the papers called down imprecations upon her head they reviled her without stint they wondered if all sense of decency was dead in this shameless murderess this brazen lobbyist this heartless seducer of the affections of weak and misguided men they implored the people for the sake of their pure wives their sinless daughters for the sake of decency for the sake of public morals to give this wretched creature such a rebuke as should be an allsufficient evidence to her and to such as her that there was a limit where the flaunting of their foul acts and opinions before the world must stop certain of them with a higher art and to her a finer cruelty a sharper torture uttered no abuse but always spoke of her in terms of mocking eulogy and ironical admiration everybody talked about the new wonder canvassed the theme of her proposed discourse and marveled how she would handle it lauras few friends wrote to her or came and talked with her and pleaded with her to retire while it was yet time and not attempt to face the gathering storm but it was fruitless she was stung to the quick by the comments of the newspapers her spirit was roused her ambition was towering now she was more determined than ever she would show these people what a hunted and persecuted woman could do the eventful night came laura arrived before the great lecture hall in a close carriage within five minutes of the time set for the lecture to begin when she stepped out of the vehicle her heart beat fast and her eyes flashed with exultation the whole street was packed with people and she could hardly force her way to the hall she reached the anteroom threw off her wraps and placed herself before the dressingglass she turned herself this way and that everything was satisfactory her attire was perfect she smoothed her hair rearranged a jewel here and there and all the while her heart sang within her and her face was radiant she had not been so happy for ages and ages it seemed to her oh no she had never been so overwhelmingly grateful and happy in her whole life before the lecture agent appeared at the door she waved him away and said do not disturb me i want no introduction and do not fear for me the moment the hands point to eight i will step upon the platform he disappeared she held her watch before her she was so impatient that the secondhand seemed whole tedious minutes dragging its way around the circle at last the supreme moment came and with head erect and the bearing of an empress she swept through the door and stood upon the stage her eyes fell upon only a vast brilliant emptiness there were not forty people in the house there were only a handful of coarse men and ten or twelve still coarser women lolling upon the benches and scattered about singly and in couples her pulses stood still her limbs quaked the gladness went out of her face there was a moment of silence and then a brutal laugh and an explosion of catcalls and hisses saluted her from the audience the clamor grew stronger and louder and insulting speeches were shouted at her a halfintoxicated man rose up and threw something which missed her but bespattered a chair at her side and this evoked an outburst of laughter and boisterous admiration she was bewildered her strength was forsaking her she reeled away from the platform reached the anteroom and dropped helpless upon a sofa the lecture agent ran in with a hurried question upon his lips but she put forth her hands and with the tears raining from her eyes said oh do not speak take me awayplease take me away out of this dreadful place oh this is like all my life failure disappointment misery always misery always failure what have i done to be so pursued take me away i beg of you i implore you upon the pavement she was hustled by the mob the surging masses roared her name and accompanied it with every species of insulting epithet they thronged after the carriage hooting jeering cursing and even assailing the vehicle with missiles a stone crushed through a blind wounding lauras forehead and so stunning her that she hardly knew what further transpired during her flight it was long before her faculties were wholly restored and then she found herself lying on the floor by a sofa in her own sittingroom and alone so she supposed she must have sat down upon the sofa and afterward fallen she raised herself up with difficulty for the air was chilly and her limbs were stiff she turned up the gas and sought the glass she hardly knew herself so worn and old she looked and so marred with blood were her features the night was far spent and a dead stillness reigned she sat down by her table leaned her elbows upon it and put her face in her hands her thoughts wandered back over her old life again and her tears flowed unrestrained her pride was humbled her spirit was broken her memory found but one resting place it lingered about her young girlhood with a caressing regret it dwelt upon it as the one brief interval of her life that bore no curse she saw herself again in the budding grace of her twelve years decked in her dainty pride of ribbons consorting with the bees and the butterflies believing in fairies holding confidential converse with the flowers busying herself all day long with airy trifles that were as weighty to her as the affairs that tax the brains of diplomats and emperors she was without sin then and unacquainted with grief the world was full of sunshine and her heart was full of music from that to this if i could only die she said if i could only go back and be as i was then for one hour and hold my fathers hand in mine again and see all the household about me as in that old innocent time and then die my god i am humbled my pride is all gone my stubborn heart repents have pity when the spring morning dawned the form still sat there the elbows resting upon the table and the face upon the hands all day long the figure sat there the sunshine enriching its costly raiment and flashing from its jewels twilight came and presently the stars but still the figure remained the moon found it there still and framed the picture with the shadow of the window sash and flooded it with mellow light by and by the darkness swallowed it up and later the gray dawn revealed it again the new day grew toward its prime and still the forlorn presence was undisturbed but now the keepers of the house had become uneasy their periodical knockings still finding no response they burst open the door the jury of inquest found that death had resulted from heart disease and was instant and painless that was all merely heart disease chapter lxi clay hawkins years gone by had yielded after many a struggle to the migratory and speculative instinct of our age and our people and had wandered further and further westward upon trading ventures settling finally in melbourne australia he ceased to roam became a steadygoing substantial merchant and prospered greatly his life lay beyond the theatre of this tale his remittances had supported the hawkins family entirely from the time of his fathers death until latterly when laura by her efforts in washington had been able to assist in this work clay was away on a long absence in some of the eastward islands when lauras troubles began trying and almost in vain to arrange certain interests which had become disordered through a dishonest agent and consequently he knew nothing of the murder till he returned and read his letters and papers his natural impulse was to hurry to the states and save his sister if possible for he loved her with a deep and abiding affection his business was so crippled now and so deranged that to leave it would be ruin therefore he sold out at a sacrifice that left him considerably reduced in worldly possessions and began his voyage to san francisco arrived there he perceived by the newspapers that the trial was near its close at salt lake later telegrams told him of the acquittal and his gratitude was boundless so boundless indeed that sleep was driven from his eyes by the pleasurable excitement almost as effectually as preceding weeks of anxiety had done it he shaped his course straight for hawkeye now and his meeting with his mother and the rest of the household was joyful albeit he had been away so long that he seemed almost a stranger in his own home but the greetings and congratulations were hardly finished when all the journals in the land clamored the news of lauras miserable death mrs hawkins was prostrated by this last blow and it was well that clay was at her side to stay her with comforting words and take upon himself the ordering of the household with its burden of labors and cares washington hawkins had scarcely more than entered upon that decade which carries one to the full blossom of manhood which we term the beginning of middle age and yet a brief sojourn at the capital of the nation had made him old his hair was already turning gray when the late session of congress began its sittings it grew grayer still and rapidly after the memorable day that saw laura proclaimed a murderess it waxed grayer and still grayer during the lagging suspense that succeeded it and after the crash which ruined his last hope the failure of his bill in the senate and the destruction of its champion dilworthy a few days later when he stood uncovered while the last prayer was pronounced over lauras grave his hair was whiter and his face hardly less old than the venerable ministers whose words were sounding in his ears a week after this he was sitting in a doublebedded room in a cheap boarding house in washington with col sellers the two had been living together lately and this mutual cavern of theirs the colonel sometimes referred to as their premises and sometimes as their apartments more particularly when conversing with persons outside a canvascovered modern trunk marked g w h stood on end by the door strapped and ready for a journey on it lay a small morocco satchel also marked g w h there was another trunk close by a worn and scarred and ancient hair relic with b s wrought in brass nails on its top on it lay a pair of saddlebags that probably knew more about the last century than they could tell washington got up and walked the floor a while in a restless sort of way and finally was about to sit down on the hair trunk stop dont sit down on that exclaimed the colonel there now thats all right the chairs better i couldnt get another trunk like that not another like it in america i reckon i am afraid not said washington with a faint attempt at a smile no indeed the man is dead that made that trunk and that saddlebags are his greatgrandchildren still living said washington with levity only in the words not in the tone well i dont know i hadnt thought of that but anyway they cant make trunks and saddlebags like that if they are no man can said the colonel with honest simplicity wife didnt like to see me going off with that trunk she said it was nearly certain to be stolen why why why arent trunks always being stolen well yes some kinds of trunks are very well then this is some kind of a trunk and an almighty rare kind too yes i believe it is well then why shouldnt a man want to steal it if he got a chance indeed i dont know why should he washington i never heard anybody talk like you suppose you were a thief and that trunk was lying around and nobody watching wouldnt you steal it come now answer fair wouldnt you steal it well now since you corner me i would take it but i wouldnt consider it stealing you wouldnt well that beats me now what would you call stealing why taking property is stealing property now what a way to talk that is what do you suppose that trunk is worth is it in good repair perfect hair rubbed off a little but the main structure is perfectly sound does it leak anywhere leak do you want to carry water in it what do you mean by does it leak why a do the clothes fall out of it when it is when it is stationary confound it washington you are trying to make fun of me i dont know what has got into you today you act mighty curious what is the matter with you well ill tell you old friend i am almost happy i am indeed it wasnt clays telegram that hurried me up so and got me ready to start with you it was a letter from louise good what is it what does she say she says come home her father has consented at last my boy i want to congratulate you i want to shake you by the hand its a long turn that has no lane at the end of it as the proverb says or somehow that way youll be happy yet and beriah sellers will be there to see thank god i believe it general boswell is pretty nearly a poor man now the railroad that was going to build up hawkeye made short work of him along with the rest he isnt so opposed to a soninlaw without a fortune now without a fortune indeed why that tennessee land never mind the tennessee land colonel i am done with that forever and forever why no you cant mean to say my father away back yonder years ago bought it for a blessing for his children and indeed he did si hawkins said to me it proved a curse to him as long as he lived and never a curse like it was inflicted upon any mans heirs im bound to say theres more or less truth it began to curse me when i was a baby and it has cursed every hour of my life to this day lord lord but its so time and again my wife i depended on it all through my boyhood and never tried to do an honest stroke of work for my living right again but then you i have chased it years and years as children chase butterflies we might all have been prosperous now we might all have been happy all these heartbreaking years if we had accepted our poverty at first and gone contentedly to work and built up our own wealth by our own toil and sweat its so its so bless my soul how often ive told si hawkins instead of that we have suffered more than the damned themselves suffer i loved my father and i honor his memory and recognize his good intentions but i grieve for his mistaken ideas of conferring happiness upon his children i am going to begin my life over again and begin it and end it with good solid work ill leave my children no tennessee land spoken like a man sir spoken like a man your hand again my boy and always remember that when a word of advice from beriah sellers can help it is at your service im going to begin again too indeed yes sir ive seen enough to show me where my mistake was the law is what i was born for i shall begin the study of the law heavens and earth but that brabants a wonderful man a wonderful man sir such a head and such a way with him but i could see that he was jealous of me the little licks i got in in the course of my argument before the jury your argument why you were a witness oh yes to the popular eye to the popular eye but i knew when i was dropping information and when i was letting drive at the court with an insidious argument but the court knew it bless you and weakened every time and brabant knew it i just reminded him of it in a quiet way and its final result and he said in a whisper you did it colonel you did it sir but keep it mum for my sake and ill tell you what you do says he you go into the law col sellers go into the law sir thats your native element and into the law the subscriber is going theres worlds of money in it whole worlds of money practice first in hawkeye then in jefferson then in st louis then in new york in the metropolis of the western world climb and climb and climb and wind up on the supreme bench beriah sellers chief justice of the supreme court of the united states sir a made man for all time and eternity thats the way i block it out sir and its as clear as day clear as the rosymorn washington had heard little of this the first reference to lauras trial had brought the old dejection to his face again and he stood gazing out of the window at nothing lost in reverie there was a knockthe postman handed in a letter it was from obedstown east tennessee and was for washington he opened it there was a note saying that enclosed he would please find a bill for the current years taxes on the acres of tennessee land belonging to the estate of silas hawkins deceased and added that the money must be paid within sixty days or the land would be sold at public auction for the taxes as provided by law the bill was for something more than twice the market value of the land perhaps washington hesitated doubts flitted through his mind the old instinct came upon him to cling to the land just a little longer and give it one more chance he walked the floor feverishly his mind tortured by indecision presently he stopped took out his pocket book and counted his money two hundred and thirty dollars it was all he had in the world one hundred and eighty from two hundred and thirty he said to himself fifty left it is enough to get me home shall i do it or shall i not i wish i had somebody to decide for me the pocket book lay open in his hand with louises small letter in view his eye fell upon that and it decided him it shall go for taxes he said and never tempt me or mine any more he opened the window and stood there tearing the tax bill to bits and watching the breeze waft them away till all were gone the spell is broken the lifelong curse is ended he said let us go the baggage wagon had arrived five minutes later the two friends were mounted upon their luggage in it and rattling off toward the station the colonel endeavoring to sing homeward bound a song whose words he knew but whose tune as he rendered it was a trial to auditors chapter lxii philip sterlings circumstances were becoming straightened the prospect was gloomy his long siege of unproductive labor was beginning to tell upon his spirits but what told still more upon them was the undeniable fact that the promise of ultimate success diminished every day now that is to say the tunnel had reached a point in the hill which was considerably beyond where the coal vein should pass according to all his calculations if there were a coal vein there and so every foot that the tunnel now progressed seemed to carry it further away from the object of the search sometimes he ventured to hope that he had made a mistake in estimating the direction which the vein should naturally take after crossing the valley and entering the hill upon such occasions he would go into the nearest mine on the vein he was hunting for and once more get the bearings of the deposit and mark out its probable course but the result was the same every time his tunnel had manifestly pierced beyond the natural point of junction and then his spirits fell a little lower his men had already lost faith and he often overheard them saying it was perfectly plain that there was no coal in the hill foremen and laborers from neighboring mines and no end of experienced loafers from the village visited the tunnel from time to time and their verdicts were always the same and always disheartening no coal in that hill now and then philip would sit down and think it all over and wonder what the mystery meant then he would go into the tunnel and ask the men if there were no signs yet none always none he would bring out a piece of rock and examine it and say to himself it is limestone it has crinoids and corals in it the rock is right then he would throw it down with a sigh and say but that is nothing where coal is limestone with these fossils in it is pretty certain to lie against its foot casing but it does not necessarily follow that where this peculiar rock is coal must lie above it or beyond it this sign is not sufficient the thought usually followed there is one infallible sign if i could only strike that three or four tines in as many weeks he said to himself am i a visionary i must be a visionary everybody is in these days everybody chases butterflies everybody seeks sudden fortune and will not lay one up by slow toil this is not right i will discharge the men and go at some honest work there is no coal here what a fool i have been i will give it up but he never could do it a half hour of profound thinking always followed and at the end of it he was sure to get up and straighten himself and say there is coal there i will not give it up and coal or no coal i will drive the tunnel clear through the hill i will not surrender while i am alive he never thought of asking mr montague for more money he said there was now but one chance of finding coal against nine hundred and ninety nine that he would not find it and so it would be wrong in him to make the request and foolish in mr montague to grant it he had been working three shifts of men finally the settling of a weekly account exhausted his means he could not afford to run in debt and therefore he gave the men their discharge they came into his cabin presently where he sat with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands the picture of discouragement and their spokesman said mr sterling when tim was down a week with his fall you kept him on halfwages and it was a mighty help to his family whenever any of us was in trouble youve done what you could to help us out youve acted fair and square with us every time and i reckon we are men and know a man when we see him we havent got any faith in that hill but we have a respect for a man thats got the pluck that youve showed youve fought a good fight with everybody agin you and if we had grub to go on im d d if we wouldnt stand by you till the cows come home that is what the boys say now we want to put in one parting blast for luck we want to work three days more if we dont find anything we wont bring in no bill against you that is what weve come to say philip was touched if he had had money enough to buy three days grub he would have accepted the generous offer but as it was he could not consent to be less magnanimous than the men and so he declined in a manly speech shook hands all around and resumed his solitary communings the men went back to the tunnel and put in a parting blast for luck anyhow they did a full days work and then took their leave they called at his cabin and gave him goodbye but were not able to tell him their days effort had given things a mere promising look the next day philip sold all the tools but two or three sets he also sold one of the now deserted cabins as old lumber together with its domestic wares and made up his mind that he would buy provisions with the trifle of money thus gained and continue his work alone about the middle of the after noon he put on his roughest clothes and went to the tunnel he lit a candle and groped his way in presently he heard the sound of a pick or a drill and wondered what it meant a spark of light now appeared in the far end of the tunnel and when he arrived there he found the man tim at work tim said im to have a job in the golden brier mine by and by in a week or ten days and im going to work here till then a man might as well be at some thing and besides i consider that i owe you what you paid me when i was laid up philip said oh no he didnt owe anything but tim persisted and then philip said he had a little provision now and would share so for several days philip held the drill and tim did the striking at first philip was impatient to see the result of every blast and was always back and peering among the smoke the moment after the explosion but there was never any encouraging result and therefore he finally lost almost all interest and hardly troubled himself to inspect results at all he simply labored on stubbornly and with little hope tim staid with him till the last moment and then took up his job at the golden brier apparently as depressed by the continued barrenness of their mutual labors as philip was himself after that philip fought his battle alone day after day and slow work it was he could scarcely see that he made any progress late one afternoon he finished drilling a hole which he had been at work at for more than two hours he swabbed it out and poured in the powder and inserted the fuse then filled up the rest of the hole with dirt and small fragments of stone tamped it down firmly touched his candle to the fuse and ran by and by the i dull report came and he was about to walk back mechanically and see what was accomplished but he halted presently turned on his heel and thought rather than said no this is useless this is absurd if i found anything it would only be one of those little aggravating seams of coal which doesnt mean anything and by this time he was walking out of the tunnel his thought ran on i am conquered i am out of provisions out of money i have got to give it up all this hard work lost but i am not conquered i will go and work for money and come back and have another fight with fate ah me it may be years it may be years arrived at the mouth of the tunnel he threw his coat upon the ground sat down on a stone and his eye sought the westering sun and dwelt upon the charming landscape which stretched its woody ridges wave upon wave to the golden horizon something was taking place at his feet which did not attract his attention his reverie continued and its burden grew more and more gloomy presently he rose up and cast a look far away toward the valley and his thoughts took a new direction there it is how good it looks but down there is not up here well i will go home and pack up there is nothing else to do he moved off moodily toward his cabin he had gone some distance before he thought of his coat then he was about to turn back but he smiled at the thought and continued his journey such a coat as that could be of little use in a civilized land a little further on he remembered that there were some papers of value in one of the pockets of the relic and then with a penitent ejaculation he turned back picked up the coat and put it on he made a dozen steps and then stopped very suddenly he stood still a moment as one who is trying to believe something and cannot he put a hand up over his shoulder and felt his back and a great thrill shot through him he grasped the skirt of the coat impulsively and another thrill followed he snatched the coat from his back glanced at it threw it from him and flew back to the tunnel he sought the spot where the coat had lain he had to look close for the light was waning then to make sure he put his hand to the ground and a little stream of water swept against his fingers thank god ive struck it at last he lit a candle and ran into the tunnel he picked up a piece of rubbish cast out by the last blast and said this clayey stuff is what ive longed for i know what is behind it he swung his pick with hearty good will till long after the darkness had gathered upon the earth and when he trudged home at length he knew he had a coal vein and that it was seven feet thick from wall to wall he found a yellow envelope lying on his rickety table and recognized that it was of a family sacred to the transmission of telegrams he opened it read it crushed it in his hand and threw it down it simply said ruth is very ill chapter lxiii it was evening when philip took the cars at the ilium station the news of his success had preceded him and while he waited for the train he was the center of a group of eager questioners who asked him a hundred things about the mine and magnified his good fortune there was no mistake this time philip in luck had become suddenly a person of consideration whose speech was freighted with meaning whose looks were all significant the words of the proprietor of a rich coal mine have a golden sound and his common sayings are repeated as if they were solid wisdom philip wished to be alone his good fortune at this moment seemed an empty mockery one of those sarcasms of fate such as that which spreads a dainty banquet for the man who has no appetite he had longed for success principally for ruths sake and perhaps now at this very moment of his triumph she was dying shust what i said mister sederling the landlord of the ilium hotel kept repeating i dold jake schmidt he find him dere shust so sure as noting you ought to have taken a share mr dusenheimer said philip yaas i know but dold woman she say you sticks to your pisiness so i sticks to em und i makes noting dat mister prierly he dont never come back here no more aint it why asked philip vell dere is so many peers and so many oder dhrinks i got em all set down ven he coomes back it was a long night for philip and a restless one at any other time the swing of the cars would have lulled him to sleep and the rattle and clank of wheels and rails the roar of the whirling iron would have only been cheerful reminders of swift and safe travel now they were voices of warning and taunting and instead of going rapidly the train seemed to crawl at a snails pace and it not only crawled but it frequently stopped and when it stopped it stood dead still and there was an ominous silence was anything the matter he wondered only a station probably perhaps he thought a telegraphic station and then he listened eagerly would the conductor open the door and ask for philip sterling and hand him a fatal dispatch how long they seemed to wait and then slowly beginning to move they were off again shaking pounding screaming through the night he drew his curtain from time to time and looked out there was the lurid sky line of the wooded range along the base of which they were crawling there was the susquehannah gleaming in the moonlight there was a stretch of level valley with silent farm houses the occupants all at rest without trouble without anxiety there was a church a graveyard a mill a village and now without pause or fear the train had mounted a trestlework high in air and was creeping along the top of it while a swift torrent foamed a hundred feet below what would the morning bring even while he was flying to her her gentle spirit might have gone on another flight whither he could not follow her he was full of foreboding he fell at length into a restless doze there was a noise in his ears as of a rushing torrent when a stream is swollen by a freshet in the spring it was like the breaking up of life he was struggling in the consciousness of coming death when ruth stood by his side clothed in white with a face like that of an angel radiant smiling pointing to the sky and saying come he awoke with a cry the train was roaring through a bridge and it shot out into daylight when morning came the train was industriously toiling along through the fat lands of lancaster with its broad farms of corn and wheat its mean houses of stone its vast barns and granaries built as if for storing the riches of heliogabalus then came the smiling fields of chester with their english green and soon the county of philadelphia itself and the increasing signs of the approach to a great city long trains of coal cars laden and unladen stood upon sidings the tracks of other roads were crossed the smoke of other locomotives was seen on parallel lines factories multiplied streets appeared the noise of a busy city began to fill the air and with a slower and slower clank on the connecting rails and interlacing switches the train rolled into the station and stood still it was a hot august morning the broad streets glowed in the sun and the whiteshuttered houses stared at the hot thoroughfares like closed bakers ovens set along the highway philip was oppressed with the heavy air the sweltering city lay as in a swoon taking a street car he rode away to the northern part of the city the newer portion formerly the district of spring garden for in this the boltons now lived in a small brick house befitting their altered fortunes he could scarcely restrain his impatience when he came in sight of the house the window shutters were not bowed thank god for that ruth was still living then he ran up the steps and rang mrs bolton met him at the door thee is very welcome philip and ruth she is very ill but quieter than she has been and the fever is a little abating the most dangerous time will be when the fever leaves her the doctor fears she will not have strength enough to rally from it yes thee can see her mrs bolton led the way to the little chamber where ruth lay oh said her mother if she were only in her cool and spacious room in our old home she says that seems like heaven mr bolton sat by ruths bedside and he rose and silently pressed philips hand the room had but one window that was wide open to admit the air but the air that came in was hot and lifeless upon the table stood a vase of flowers ruths eyes were closed her cheeks were flushed with fever and she moved her head restlessly as if in pain ruth said her mother bending over her philip is here ruths eyes unclosed there was a gleam of recognition in them there was an attempt at a smile upon her face and she tried to raise her thin hand as philip touched her forehead with his lips and he heard her murmur dear phil there was nothing to be done but to watch and wait for the cruel fever to burn itself out dr longstreet told philip that the fever had undoubtedly been contracted in the hospital but it was not malignant and would be little dangerous if ruth were not so worn down with work or if she had a less delicate constitution it is only her indomitable will that has kept her up for weeks and if that should leave her now there will be no hope you can do more for her now sir than i can how asked philip eagerly your presence more than anything else will inspire her with the desire to live when the fever turned ruth was in a very critical condition for two days her life was like the fluttering of a lighted candle in the wind philip was constantly by her side and she seemed to be conscious of his presence and to cling to him as one borne away by a swift stream clings to a stretchedout hand from the shore if he was absent a moment her restless eyes sought something they were disappointed not to find philip so yearned to bring her back to life he willed it so strongly and passionately that his will appeared to affect hers and she seemed slowly to draw life from his after two days of this struggle with the grasping enemy it was evident to dr longstreet that ruths will was beginning to issue its orders to her body with some force and that strength was slowly coming back in another day there was a decided improvement as philip sat holding her weak hand and watching the least sign of resolution in her face ruth was able to whisper i so want to live for you phil you will darling you must said philip in a tone of faith and courage that carried a thrill of determination of command along all her nerves slowly philip drew her back to life slowly she came back as one willing but well nigh helpless it was new for ruth to feel this dependence on anothers nature to consciously draw strength of will from the will of another it was a new but a dear joy to be lifted up and carried back into the happy world which was now all aglow with the light of love to be lifted and carried by the one she loved more than her own life sweetheart she said to philip i would not have cared to come back but for thy love not for thy profession oh thee may be glad enough of that some day when thy coal bed is dug out and thee and father are in the air again when ruth was able to ride she was taken into the country for the pure air was necessary to her speedy recovery the family went with her philip could not be spared from her side and mr bolton had gone up to ilium to look into that wonderful coal mine and to make arrangements for developing it and bringing its wealth to market philip had insisted on reconveying the ilium property to mr bolton retaining only the share originally contemplated for himself and mr bolton therefore once more found himself engaged in business and a person of some consequence in third street the mine turned out even better than was at first hoped and would if judiciously managed be a fortune to them all this also seemed to be the opinion of mr bigler who heard of it as soon as anybody and with the impudence of his class called upon mr bolton for a little aid in a patent carwheel he had bought an interest in that rascal small he said had swindled him out of all he had mr bolton told him he was very sorry and recommended him to sue small mr small also came with a similar story about mr bigler and mr bolton had the grace to give him like advice and he added if you and bigler will procure the indictment of each other you may have the satisfaction of putting each other in the penitentiary for the forgery of my acceptances bigler and small did not quarrel however they both attacked mr bolton behind his back as a swindler and circulated the story that he had made a fortune by failing in the pure air of the highlands amid the golden glories of ripening september ruth rapidly came back to health how beautiful the world is to an invalid whose senses are all clarified who has been so near the world of spirits that she is sensitive to the finest influences and whose frame responds with a thrill to the subtlest ministrations of soothing nature mere life is a luxury and the color of the grass of the flowers of the sky the wind in the trees the outlines of the horizon the forms of clouds all give a pleasure as exquisite as the sweetest music to the ear famishing for it the world was all new and fresh to ruth as if it had just been created for her and love filled it till her heart was overflowing with happiness it was golden september also at fallkill and alice sat by the open window in her room at home looking out upon the meadows where the laborers were cutting the second crop of clover the fragrance of it floated to her nostrils perhaps she did not mind it she was thinking she had just been writing to ruth and on the table before her was a yellow piece of paper with a faded fourleaved clover pinned on it only a memory now in her letter to ruth she had poured out her heartiest blessings upon them both with her dear love forever and forever thank god she said they will never know they never would know and the world never knows how many women there are like alice whose sweet but lonely lives of selfsacrifice gentle faithful loving souls bless it continually she is a dear girl said philip when ruth showed him the letter yes phil and we can spare a great deal of love for her our own lives are so full appendix perhaps some apology to the reader is necessary in view of our failure to find lauras father we supposed from the ease with which lost persons are found in novels that it would not be difficult but it was indeed it was impossible and therefore the portions of the narrative containing the record of the search have been stricken out not because they were not interesting for they were but inasmuch as the man was not found after all it did not seem wise to harass and excite the reader to no purpose the authors
