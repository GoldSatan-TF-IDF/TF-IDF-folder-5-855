chapter i how sir godfrey came to lose his temper illustration the bvtler his boy godfrey disseisin there was something wrong in the cellar at wantley manor little whelpdale knew it for he was buttons and buttons always knows what is being done with the wine though he may look as if he did not and old popham knew it too he was butler and responsible to sir godfrey for all the brandy and ale and cider and mead and canary and other strong waters there were in the house now sir godfrey disseisin fourth baron of wantley and immediate tenant by knightservice to his majesty king john of england was particular about his dogs and particular about his horses and about his only daughter and his boy roland and had been very particular indeed about his wife who i am sorry to say did not live long but all this was nothing to the fuss he made about his wine when the claret was not warm enough or the moselle wine was not cool enough you could hear him roaring all over the house for though generous in heart and a staunch churchman he was immoderately choleric very often when sir godfrey fell into one of his rages at dinner old popham standing behind his chair trembled so violently that his calves would shake loose thus obliging him to hasten behind the tall leathern screen at the head of the banquethall and readjust them twice in each year the baron sailed over to france where he visited the winemerchants and tasted samples of all new vintages though they frequently gave him unmentionable aches then when he was satisfied that he had selected the soundest and richest he returned to wantley manor bringing home wooden casks that were as big as haystacks and so full they could not gurgle when you tipped them upon arriving he sent for mrs mistletoe the family governess and for economys sake housekeeper who knew how to write something the barons father and mother had never taught him when he was a little boy because they didnt know how themselves and despised people who did and when mrs mistletoe had cut neat pieces of cardboard for labels and got ready her goosequill sir godfrey would say write chвteau lafitte or write chambertin those you know were the names and dates of the vintages yes my lord mistletoe always piped up on which sir godfrey would peer over her shoulder at the writing and mutter hum yes thats correct just as if he knew how to read the old humbug then mistletoe who was a silly girl and had lost her husband early would go teehee sir godfrey as the gallant gentleman gave her a kiss of course this was not just what he should have done but he was a widower you must remember and besides that as the years went on this little ceremony ceased to be kept up when it was chвteau lafitte kissing mistletoe was one thing but when it came to chambertin the lady weighed two hundred and twentyfive pounds and wore a wig but wig and all mistletoe had a high position in wantley manor the household was conducted on strictly feudal principles nobody except the members of the family received higher consideration than did the old governess she and the chaplain were on a level socially and they sat at the same table with the baron that drew the line old popham the butler might tell little whelpdale as often as he pleased that he was just as good as mistletoe but he had to pour out mistletoes wine for her notwithstanding if she scolded him which she always did if sir godfrey had been scolding her do you suppose he dared to answer back gracious no he merely kicked the two headfootmen meeson and welsby and spoke severely to the nine housemaids meeson and welsby then made life a painful thing for the five underfootmen and the grooms while the nine housemaids boxed the ears of whelpdale the buttons and whelpdale the buttons punched the scullions eye as for the scullion he was bottom of the list but he could always relieve his feelings by secretly pulling the tails of sir godfreys two tame ravens whose names were croak james and croak elizabeth i never knew what these birds did at that but something you may be sure so you see that i was right when i said the household was conducted on strictly feudal principles the cook had a special jurisdiction of her own and everybody was more or less afraid of her whenever sir godfrey had come home with new wine and after the labels had been pasted on the casks then popham with whelpdale beside him had these carefully set down in the cellar which was a vast dim room the ceilings supported by heavy arches the barrels bins kegs hogsheads tuns and demijohns of every size and shape standing like forests and piled to the ceiling and now something was wrong there this eres a hawful succumstence sir observed whelpdale the buttons to his superior respectfully it is indeed a himbroglio replied popham who had a wide command of words and knew it neither domestic spoke again for some time they were seated in the buttery the butler crossed his right leg over his left and waved the suspended foot up and down something he seldom did unless very grievously perturbed as for poor little whelpdale he mopped his brow with the napkins that were in a basket waiting for the wash then the bell rang his ludships studybell said popham dont keep him waiting hadnt you better apprise his ludship of the facks asked whelpdale in a weak voice popham made no reply he arose and briefly kicked buttons out of the buttery then he mounted a chair to listen better he has hentered his ludships apawtment he remarked hearing the sound of voices come faintly down the little private staircase that led from sir godfreys study to the buttery the baron was in the habit of coming down at night for crackers and cheese before he went to bed presently one voice grew much louder than the other it questioned there came a sort of whining in answer then came a terrific stamp on the ceiling and a loud go on sir now now now thought popham do you want to hear at once without waiting any longer what little whelpdale is telling sir godfrey well you must know that for the past thirteen years ever since the neighbourhood had been scourged by a terrible dragon the monster was covered with scales and had a long tail and huge unnatural wings beside fearful jaws that poured out smoke and flame whenever they opened he always came at dead of night roaring bellowing and sparkling and flaming over the hills and horrid claps of thunder were very likely to attend his progress concerning the nature and quality of his roaring the honest copyholders of wantley could never agree although every human being had heard him hundreds of times some said it was like a mad bull only much louder and worse old gaffer piers the ploughman swore that if his tomcat weighed a thousand pounds it would make a noise almost as bad as that on summer nights with the moon at the full and other cats handy but farmer stiles said nay tis like none of your bulls nor cats but when i have come home too near the next morning my wife can make me think of this dragon as soon as ever her mouth be open illustration popham awaiteth the result with dignity this shows you that there were divers opinions if you were not afraid to look out of the window about midnight you could see the sky begin to look red in the quarter from which he was approaching just as it glares when some distant house is on fire but you must shut the window and hide before he came over the hill for very few that had looked upon the dragon ever lived to that day twelvemonth this monster devoured the substance of the tenantry and yeomen when their fields of grain were golden for the harvest in a single night he cut them down and left their acres blasted by his deadly fire he ate the cows the sheep the poultry and at times even sucked eggs many pious saints had visited the district but not one had been able by his virtue to expel the dragon and the farmers and country folk used to repeat a legend that said the dragon was a punishment for the great wickedness of the barons ancestor the original sir godfrey disseisin who when summoned on the first crusade to palestine had entirely refused to go and help his cousin godfrey de bouillon wrest the holy sepulchre from the paynim the barons ancestor when a stout young lad had come over with william the conqueror and you must know that to have an ancestor who had come over with william the conqueror was in those old days a much rarer thing than it is now and any one who could boast of it was held in high esteem by his neighbours who asked him to dinner and left their cards upon him continually but the first sir godfrey thought one conquest was enough for any man and in reply to his cousins invitation to try a second answered in his blunt norman french nul tiel verte dedans ceot oyle which displeased the church and ended forever all relations between the families the dragon did not come at once for this gentlemans son the grandfather of our sir godfrey as soon as he was twentyone went off to the holy land himself fought very valiantly and was killed leaving behind him at wantley an inconsolable little wife and an heir six months old this somewhat appeased the pope but the present sir godfrey when asked to accompany king richard lion heart on his campaign against the infidel did not avail himself of the opportunity to set the family right in the matter of crusades this hereditary impiety which the pope did not consider at all mended by the barons most regular attendance at the parish church on all sundays feast days fast days high days low days saints days vigils and octaves nor by his paying his tithes punctually to father anselm abbot of oysterlemain a wonderful person of whom i shall have a great deal to tell you presently this impiety i say finished the good standing of the house of wantley rome frowned the earth trembled and the dragon came and the legend went on to say this curse would not be removed until a female lineal descendant of the first sir godfrey a young lady who had never been married and had never loved anybody except her father and mother and her sisters and brothers should go out in the middle of the night on christmas eve all by herself and encounter the dragon single handed now of course this is not what little whelpdale is trying to tell the baron up in the study for everybody in wantley knew all about the legend except one person and that was miss elaine sir godfreys only daughter eighteen years old at the last court of piepoudre when her father after paying all the farmers for all the cows and sheep they told him had been eaten by the dragon since the last court had made his customary proclamation to wit his goodwill and protection to all his tenantry and if any man woman child or other person caused his daughter miss elaine to hear anything about the legend such talebearer should be chained to a tree and kept fat until the dragon found him and ate him so everybody obligingly kept the barons secret sir godfrey is just this day returned from france with some famous tuns of wine and presents for elaine and mrs mistletoe his humour is or was till whelpdale poor wretch answered the bell of the best possible and now this moment he is being told by the luckless buttons that the dragon of wantley has taken to drinking as well as eating what does not belong to him has for the last three nights burst the big gates of the winecellar that open on the hillside the manor stands upon that a hogshead of the barons best burgundy is going and that two hogsheads of his choicest malvoisie are gone one hundred and twentyeight gallons in three nights work but i suppose a firebreathing dragon must be very thirsty there was a dead silence in the study overhead and old pophams calves were shaking loose as he waited and so you stood by and let this black sneaking prowling thieving here the baron used some shocking expressions which i shall not set down dragon swill my wine st st stood by your ludship said little whelpdale no sir no one didnt do any standing by sir he roared that terrible sir we was all under the bed now by my coat of mail and great right leg shouted sir godfrey the quaking popham heard no more the door of the private staircase flew open with a loud noise and down came little whelpdale head over heels into the buttery after him strode sir godfrey in full mail armour clashing his steel fists against the banisters the nosepiece of his helmet was pushed up to allow him to speak plainly and most plainly did he speak i can assure you all the way down stairs keeping his right eye glaring upon popham in one corner of the buttery and at the same time petrifying whelpdale with his left from father to son the disseisins had always been famous for the manner in which they could straddle their eyes and in sir godfrey the family trait was very strongly marked illustration the baron pursueth whelpdale into the buttery arrived at the bottom he stopped for a moment to throw a ham through the stainedglass window and then made straight for popham but the head butler was an old family servant and had learned to know his place with surprising agility he hopped on a table so that sir godfreys foot flew past its destined goal and caught a shelf that was loaded with a good deal of his wedding china the baron was far too dignified a person to take any notice of this mishap and he simply strode on out of the buttery and so through the halls of the manor where all who caught even the most distant sight of his coming promptly withdrew into the privacy of their apartments illustration illustration chapter ii how his daughter miss elaine behaued in consequence illustration elaine mistletoe the baron walked on his rage mounting as he went till presently he began talking aloud to himself mort daieul and cosenage he muttered grinding his teeth over these oaths matters have come to a pretty pass per my and per tout and this is what my winebibbing ancestor has brought on his posterity by his omission to fight for the true faith sir godfrey knew the outrageous injustice of this remark as well as you or i do and so did the portrait of his ancestor which he happened to be passing under for the red nose in the tapestry turned a deeper ruby in scornful anger but luckily for the nerves of its descendant the moths had eaten its mouth away so entirely that the retort it attempted to make sounded only like a faint hiss which the baron mistook for a little gust of wind behind the arras my ruddy burgundy he groaned going going and my rich fruity malvoisie all gone father anselm didnt appreciate it either that night he dined here last september he said i had put eggshells in it eggshells pooh as if any parson could talk about wine these church folk had better mind their business and say grace and eat their dinner and be thankful thats what i say eggshells forsooth the baron was passing through the chapel and he mechanically removed his helmet but he did not catch sight of the glittering eye of father anselm himself who had stepped quickly into the confessional and there in the dark watched sir godfrey with a strange mocking smile when he had the chapel to himself again the tall gray figure of the abbot appeared in full view and craftily moved across the place if you had been close beside him and had listened hard you could have heard a faint clank and jingle beneath his gown as he moved which would have struck you as not the sort of noise a hairshirt ought to make but i am glad you were not there for i do not like the way the abbot looked at all especially so near christmastide when almost every one somehow looks kinder as he goes about in the world father anselm moved out of the chapel and passed through lonely corridors out of wantley manor out of the courtyard and so took his way to oysterlemain in the gathering dusk the few people who met him received his blessing and asked no questions for they were all serfs of the glebe and well used to meeting the abbot going and coming near wantley manor meanwhile sir godfrey paced along to think he continued aloud to think the country could be rid of this monster this guzzling serpent in a few days plenty would reign again public peace of mind would be restored the cattle would increase the crops would grow my rents treble and my wines be drunk no more by a miserable ignorant but no im her father elaine shall never be permitted to sacrifice herself for one dragon or twenty dragons either why whats the matter papa sir godfrey started there was miss elaine in front of him and she had put on one of the new french gowns he had brought over with him matter plenty of matter he began unluckily at least nothing is the matter at all my dear what a question am i not back all safe from the sea nothing is the matter of course hasnt your old father been away from you two whole months and werent those pretty dresses he has carried back with him for his little girl and isnt the wine zounds no the wine isnt at least certainly it is to be sure its what it ought to be what it ought to be yes but mort daieul not where it ought to be hum hum i think i am going mad and sir godfrey forgetting he held the helmet all this while dashed his hands to his head with such violence that the steel edge struck hard above the ear and in one minute had raised a lump there as large as the egg of a fowl poor poor papa said miss elaine and she ran and fetched some cold water and dipping her dainty lace handkerchief into it she bathed the barons head thank you my child he murmured presently of course nothing is the matter they were very slow in putting the new here he gave a gulp casks of wine into the cellar thats all twill soon be dinnertime i must make me ready and so saying the baron kissed his daughter and strode away towards his dressingroom but she heard him shout mort daieul more than once before he was out of hearing then his dressingroom door shut with a bang and sent echoes all along the entries above and below illustration sir godfrey maketh him ready for the bath the december night was coming down and a little twinkling lamp hung at the end of the passage towards this miss elaine musingly turned her steps still squeezing her now nearly dry handkerchief what did he mean she said to herself elaine shouted sir godfrey away off round a corner yes papa im coming dont come im going to the bath a did you hear me say anything particular do you mean when i met you answered elaine yes no that is not exactly papa then dont dare to ask me any questions for i wont have it and another door slammed what did papa mean said miss elaine once more her bright brown eyes were looking at the floor as she walked slowly on towards the light and her lips which had been a little open so that you could have seen what dainty teeth she had shut quite close in fact she was thinking which was something you could seldom accuse her of i do not know exactly what her thoughts were except that the words dragon and sacrifice kept bumping against each other in them continually and whenever they bumped miss elaine frowned a little deeper till she really looked almost solemn in this way she came under the hanging lamp and entered the door in front of which it shone illustration sir godfrey getteth in to hys bath this was the ladies library full of the most touching romances about roland and walter of aquitaine and sir tristram and a great number of other excitable young fellows whose behaviour had invariably got them into dreadful difficulties but had as invariably made them in the eyes of every damsel they saw the most attractive fascinating sweet dear creatures in the world nobody ever read any of these books except mrs mistletoe and the family chaplain these two were indeed the only people in the household that knew how to read which may account for it in some measure it was here that miss elaine came in while she was thinking so hard and found old mistletoe huddled to the fire she had been secretly reading the first chapters of a new and pungent french romance called roger and angelica that was being published in a paris and a london magazine simultaneously only thus could the talented french author secure payment for his books in england for king john who had recently murdered his little nephew arthur had now turned his attention to obstructing all arrangements for an international copyright in many respects this monarch was no credit to his family illustration mistletoe consvlteth ye cookynge booke when the governess heard miss elaine open the door behind her she thought it was the family chaplain and quickly throwing the shocking story on the floor she opened the household cookerybook an enormous volume many feet square suspended from the ceiling by strong chains and containing several thousand receipts for english french italian croatian dalmatian and acarnanian dishes beginning with a poem in blank verse written to his confectioner by the emperor charles the fat german cooking was omitted im looking up a new plumpudding for christmas said mistletoe nervously keeping her virtuous eyes on the volume ah indeed miss elaine answered indifferently she was thinking harder than ever was in fact inventing a little plan oh so its you deary cried the governess much relieved she had feared the chaplain might pick up the guilty magazine and find its pages cut only at the place where the french story was and i am grieved to have to tell you that this is just what he did do later in the evening and sat down in his private room and read about roger and angelica himself heres a good one said mistletoe number in the appendix to part fourth chop two pounds of leeks and but i may not be here to taste it said elaine bless the child said mistletoe and where else would you be on christmasday but in your own house perhaps far away who knows you havent gone and seen a young man and told him a young man indeed said elaine with a toss of her head theres not a young man in england i would tell anything save to go about his business miss elaine had never seen any young men except when they came to dine on sir godfreys invitation and his manner on those occasions so awed them that they always sat on the edge of their chairs and said no thank you when the baron said have some more capon then the baron would snort nonsense popham bring me master percivals plate upon which master percival invariably simpered and said that really he did believe he would take another slice after these dinners miss elaine retired to her own part of the house and that was all she ever saw of young men whom she very naturally deemed a class to be despised as silly and wholly lacking in selfassertion then where in the name of good saints are you going to be mistletoe went on why said elaine slowly and here she looked very slyly at the old governess and then quickly appeared to be considering the lace on her dress why of course papa would not permit me to sacrifice myself for one dragon or twenty dragons what screamed mistletoe all in a flurry for she was a fool what of course i know papa would say that said miss elaine demure as possible oh mercy me squeaked mistletoe we are undone to be sure i might agree with papa said the artful thing knowing well enough she was on the right track oo oo went the governess burying her nose in the household cookerybook and rocking from side to side but then i might not agree with papa you know i might think might think miss elaine stopped at what she might think for really she hadnt the slightest idea what to say next you have no right to think no right at all burst out mistletoe and you shant be allowed to think ill tell sir godfrey at once and hell forbid you oh dear oh dear just before christmas eve too the only night in the year she has no time to change her mind and shell be eaten up if she goes i know she will what villain told you of this child let me know and he shall be punished at once i shall not tell you that said elaine then everybody will be suspected moaned mistletoe everybody the whole household and we shall all be thrown to the dragon oh dear was there ever such a state of things the governess betook herself to weeping and wringing her hands and elaine stood watching her and wondering how in the world she could find out more she knew now just enough to keep her from eating or sleeping until she knew everything i dont agree with papa at all she said during a lull in the tears this was the only remark she could think of hell lock you up and feed you on bread and water till you do oo oo sobbed mistletoe and by that time we shall all be ea ea eaten up but ill talk to papa and make him change his mind he wont do you think youre going to make him care more about a lot of sheep and cows than he does about his only daughter doesnt he pay the people for everything the dragon eats up who would pay him for you when you were eaten up how do you know that i should be eaten up asked miss elaine oh dear oh dear and how could you stop it what could a girl do alone against a dragon in the middle of the night but on christmas eve suggested the young lady there might be something different about that he might feel better you know on christmas eve do you suppose a wicked ravenous dragon with a heathen tail is going to care whether it is christmas eve or not hed have you for his christmas dinner and thats all the notice he would take of the day and then perhaps he wouldnt leave the country after all how can you be sure he would go away just because that odious vulgar legend says so who would rely on a dragon and so there you would be gone and he would be here and everything mistletoes tears flowed afresh but you see she had said all that miss elaine was so curious to know about and the fatal secret was out illustration elaine maketh an vnexpected remark the quarterbell rang for dinner and both the women hastened to their rooms to make ready mistletoe still boohooing and snuffling and declaring that she had always said some wretched abominable villain would tell her child about that horrid ridiculous legend that was a perfect falsehood as anybody could see and very likely invented by the dragon himself because no human being with any feelings at all would think of such a cruel absurd idea and if they ever did they deserved to be eaten themselves and she would not have it she said a great deal more that elaine in the next room could not hear though the door was open between because the governess put her fat old face under the cold water in the basin and though she went on talking just the same it only produced an angry sort of bubbling which conveyed very little notion of what she meant so they descended the stairway miss elaine walking first very straight and solemn and that was the way she marched into the banquethall where sir godfrey waited papa said she i think ill meet the dragon on christmas eve illustration chapter iii reueals the dragon in his den illustration brother hubert around the sullen towers of oysterlemain the snow was falling steadily it was slowly banking up in the deep sills of the windows and hubert the sacristan had given up sweeping the steps patches of it that had collected on the top of the great bell as the slanting draughts blew it in through the belfrywindow slid down from time to time among the birds which had nestled for shelter in the beams below from the heavy main outergates the country spread in a white unbroken sheet to the woods twice perhaps through the morning had wayfarers toiled by along the nearlyobliterated highroad good luck to the holy men each had said to himself as he looked at the chill and austere walls of the monastery good luck and i hope that within there they be warmer than i am then i think it very likely that as he walked on blowing the fingers of the hand that held his staff he thought of his fireside and his wife and blessed providence for not making him pious enough to be a monk and a bachelor this is what was doing in the world outside now inside the stone walls of oysterlemain whose grim solidity spoke of narrow cells and of pious knees continually bent in prayer not a monk paced the corridors and not a step could be heard above or below in the staircase that wound up through the round towers silence was everywhere save that from a remote quarter of the monastery came a faint sound of music upon such a time as christmas eve it might well be that carols in plenty would be sung or studied by the saintly men but this sounded like no carol at times the humming murmur of the storm drowned the measure whatever it was and again it came along the dark cold entries clearer than before away in a long vaulted room whose only approach was a passage in the thickness of the walls safe from the intrusion of the curious a company is sitting round a cavernous chimney where roars and crackles a great blazing heap of logs surely for a monkish song their melody is most odd yet monks they are for all are clothed in gray like father anselm and a rope round the waist of each but what can possibly be in that huge silver rundlet into which they plunge their goblets so often the song grows louder than ever we are the monks of oysterlemain hooded and gowned as fools may see hooded and gowned though we monks be is that a reason we should abstain from cups of the gamesome burgundie though our garments make it plain that we are monks of oysterlemain that is no reason we should abstain from cups of the gamesome burgundie im sweating hot says one how for disrobing brothers no danger on such a day as this foul luck to the snow which you see was coarse and vulgar language for any one to be heard to use and particularly so for a godly celibate but the words were scarce said when off fly those monks hoods and the waistropes rattle as they fall on the floor and the gray gowns drop down and are kicked away every man jack of them is in black armour with a long sword buckled to his side long cheer to the guild of goasyouplease they shouted hoarsely and dashed their drinkinghorns on the board then filled them again give us a song hubert said one the days a dull one out in the world illustration wait a while replied hubert whose nose was hidden in his cup this new wantley tipple is a vastly comfortable brew what dye call the stuff malvoisie thou oaf said another and of a delicacy many degrees above thy bumpkin palate leave profaning it therefore and to thy refrain without more ado most unctuous sir replied hubert in demanding me this favour you seem forgetful that the juice of pleasure is sweeter than the milk of human kindness ill not sing to give thee an opportunity to outnumber me in thy cups and he filled and instantly emptied another sound bumper of the malvoisie lurching slightly as he did so health he added preparing to swallow the next a murrain on such pagan thirst exclaimed he who had been toasted snatching the cup away art thou altogether unslakable is thy belly a limekiln nay shalt taste not a single drop more hubert till we have a stave come tune up man give me but leave to hold the empty vessel then the singer pleaded falling on one knee in mock supplication accorded thou sot laughed the other carol away now they fell into silence each replenishing his drinkinghorn the snow beat soft against the window and from outside far above them sounded the melancholy note of the bell ringing in the hour for meditation so hubert began when the sable veil of night over hill and glen is spread the yeoman bolts his door in fright and he quakes within his bed far away on his ear there strikes a sound of dread something comes it is here it is passed with awful tread theres a flash of unholy flame there is smoke hangs hot in the air twas the dragon of wantley came beware of him beware but we beside the fire sit close to the steaming bowl we pile the logs up higher and loud our voices roll when the yeoman wakes at dawn to begin his round of toil his garners bare his sheep are gone and the dragon holds the spoil all day long through the earth that yeoman makes his moan all day long there is mirth behind these walls of stone for we are the lords of ease the gaolers of carking care the guild of goasyouplease beware of us beware so we beside the fire sit down to the steaming bowl we pile the logs up higher and loud our voices roll the roar of twenty lusty throats and the clatter of cups banging on the table rendered the words of the chorus entirely inaudible heres malvoisie for thee hubert said one of the company dipping into the rundlet but his hand struck against the dry bottom they had finished four gallons since breakfast and it was scarcely eleven gone on the clock oh i am betrayed hubert sang out then he added but there is a plenty where that came from and with that he reached for his gown and fetching out a bunch of great brass keys proceeded towards a tall door in the wall and turned the lock the door swung open and hubert plunged into the dark recess thus disclosed an exclamation of chagrin followed and the empty hide of a huge crocodile with a pair of trailing wings to it came bumping out from the closet into the hall giving out many hollow cracks as it floundered along fresh from a vigourous kick that the intemperate minstrel had administered in his rage at having put his hand into the open jaws of the monster instead of upon the neck of the demijohn that contained the malvoisie beshrew thee hubert said the voice of a newcomer who stood eyeing the proceedings from a distance near where he had entered treat the carcase of our patron saint with a more befitting reverence or ill have thee caged and put upon bread and water remember that whosoever kicks that skin in some sort kicks me long life to the dragon of wantley said hubert reappearing very dusty but clasping a plump demijohn hubert my lad said the newcomer put back that vessel of inebriation and because i like thee well for thy youth and thy sweet voice do not therefore presume too far with me a somewhat uneasy pause followed upon this and while hubert edged back into the closet with his demijohn father anselm frowned slightly as his eyes turned upon the scene of late hilarity but where is the dragon in his den you ask are we not coming to him soon ah but we have come to him you shall hear the truth never believe that sham story about more of more hall and how he slew the dragon of wantley it is a gross fabrication of some unscrupulous and mediocre literary person who i make no doubt was in the pay of more to blow his trumpet so loud that a credulous posterity might hear it my account of the dragon is the only true one illustration chapter iv tells all about him illustration in those days of shifting fortunes of turbulence and rapine of knightserrant and minstrels seeking for adventure and love and of solitary pilgrims and bodies of pious men wandering over europe to proclaim that the duty of all was to arise and quell the pagan defilers of the holy shrine good men and bad men undoubted saints and unmistakable sinners drifted forward and back through every country came by night and by day to every household and lived their lives in that unbounded and perilous freedom that put them at one moment upon the top limit of their ambition or their delight and plunged them into violent and bloody death almost ere the moment was gone it was a time when fatten at thy neighbours expense was the one commandment observed by many who outwardly maintained a profound respect for the original ten and any man whose wit taught him how this commandment could be obeyed with the greatest profit and the least danger was in high standing among his fellows hence it was that francis almoign knight of the voracious stomach cumbered with no domestic ties worthy of mention a tall slim fellow who knew the appropriate hour to slit a throat or to wheedle a maid came to be grand marshal of the guild of goasyouplease this secret band under its grand marshal roved over europe and thrived mightily each member was as stout hearted a villain as you could see sometimes their doings came to light and they were forced to hasten across the borders of an outraged territory into new pastures yet they fared well in the main for they could fight and drink and sing and many a fair one smiled upon them in spite of their perfectly outrageous morals so one day they came into the neighbourhood of oysterlemain where much confusion reigned among the good monks sir godfrey disseisin over at wantley had let richard lion heart depart for the holy wars without him like father like son the people muttered in their discontent sure the church will gravely punish this second offence to all these whisperings of rumour the grand marshal of the guild paid fast attention for he was a man who laid his plans deeply and much in advance of the event he saw the country was fat and the neighbours foolish he took note of the handsome tithes that came in to oysterlemain for the support of the monks he saw all these things and set himself to thinking upon a stormy afternoon when the light was nearly gone out of the sky a band of venerable pilgrims stood at the great gates of the monastery their garments were tattered their shoes were in sad disrepair they had walked they said all the way from jerusalem might they find shelter for the night the tale they told and the mere sight of their trembling old beards would have melted hearts far harder than those which beat in the breasts of the monks of oysterlemain but above all these pilgrims brought with them as convincing proofs of their journey a collection of relics and talismans such as are to be met with only in eastern countries of great wonder and virtue with singular generosity which they explained had been taught them by the arabs they presented many of these treasures to the delighted inmates of the monastery who hastened to their respective cells this one reverently cherishing a tuft of hair from the tail of one of daniels lions another handling with deep fervour a strip of the coat of many colours once worn by the excellent joseph but the most extraordinary relic among them all was the skin of a huge lizard beast the like of which none in england had ever seen this the pilgrims told their hosts was no less a thing than a crocodile from the nile the renowned river of moses it had been pressed upon them as they were departing from the city of damascus by a friend a blameless chiropodist whose name was omar khayyam he it was who eked out a pious groat by tending the feet of all outward and inward bound pilgrims seated at the entrance of his humble booth with the foot of some holy man in his lap he would speak words of kindness and wisdom as he reduced the inflammation one of his quaintest sayings was if the pope has bid thee wear hair next thy bare skin my son why clap a wig over thy shaven scalp so the monks in proper pity and kindness when they had shut the great gates as night came down made their pilgrim guests welcome to bide at oysterlemain as long as they pleased the solemn bell for retiring rolled forth in the darkness with a single deep clang and the sound went far and wide over the neighbouring district those peasants who were still awake in their scattered cottages crossed themselves as they thought the holy men at oysterlemain are just now going to their rest and thus the world outside grew still and the thick walls of the monastery loomed up against the stars deep in the midnight many a choking cry rang fearfully through the stony halls but came not to the outer air and the waning moon shone faintly down upon the enclosure of the garden where worked a band of silent gravediggers clad in black armour and with bloodred hands the good country folk who came at early morning with their presents of poultry and milk little guessed what sheeps clothing the gray cowls and gowns of oysterlemain had become in a single night nor what impious lips those were which now muttered blessings over their bent heads the following night hideous sounds were heard in the fields and those who dared to open their shutters to see what the matter was beheld a huge lizard beast with fiery breath and accompanied by rattling thunder raging over the soil which he hardly seemed to touch in this manner did the dreaded dragon of wantley make his appearance and in this manner did sir francis almoign knight of the voracious stomach stand in the shoes of that father anselm whom he had put so comfortably out of the way under the flowerbeds in the monastery garden and never a soul in the world except his companions in orgy to know the difference he even came to be welcome at sir godfreys table for after the dragons appearance the baron grew civil to all members of the church by day this versatile sinner the grand marshal would walk in the sight of the world with staid step clothed in gray his hood concealing his fierce unchurchly eyes by night inside the crocodile skin he visited what places he chose unhindered by the terrified dwellers and after him came his followers of the guild to steal the plunder and bear it back inside the walls of oysterlemain never in all their adventures had these superb miscreants been in better plight but now the trouble had begun as you are going to hear we return to hubert and the company hubert and all of you said father anselm or rather sir francis the grand marshal as we know him to be they say that whom the gods desire to destroy him do they first make drunk with wine the application the application they shouted in hoarse and mirthful chorus for they were certainly near that state favourable to destruction by the gods one black fellow with a sliding gait ran into the closet and brought a sheet of thin iron and a strange torchlike tube which he lighted at the fire and blew into from the other end a plume of spitting flame immediately shot far into the air illustration hubert looketh out of ye window before thy sermon proceeds old dragon he said puffing unsteady but solemn breaths between his words wrap up in lightning and thunder that we may be may be lieve what you say then he shook the iron till it gave forth a frightful shattering sound the grand marshal said not a word with three long steps he stood towering in front of the man and dealt him a side blow under the ear with his steel fist he fell instantly folding together like something boneless and lay along the floor for a moment quite still except that some piece in his armour made a light rattling as though there were muscles that quivered beneath it then he raised himself slowly to a bench where his brothers sat waiting soberly enough only young hubert grinned aside to his neighbour who perceiving it kept his eyes fixed as far from that youth as possible thy turn next if art not careful hubert said sir francis very quietly as he seated himself wonder of saints hubert thought secretly not moving at all how could he have seen that tis no small piece of good fortune continued the grand marshal that some one among us can put aside his slavish appetites and keep a clear eye on the watch against misadventure here is my news that hotchpot of lies we set going among the people has fallen foul of us the daughter of sir godfrey has heard our legend and last week told her sire that tonight she would follow it out to the letter and meet the dragon of wantley alone in single combat has she never loved any man asked one she fulfils every condition who told her that most consummate of fools the mistletoe said the grand marshal what did sir godfrey do upon that inquired hubert he locked up his girl and chained the governess to a rock where she has remained in deadly terror ever since but kept fat for me to devour her me and sir francis permitted himself to smile though not very broadly how if sir dragon had found the maid chained instead of the ancient widow hubert said venturing to tread a little nearer to familiarity on the strength of the amusement which played across the grand masters face ah hubert boy he replied i see it is not in the spring only but in autumn and summer and winter as well that thy fancy turns to thoughts of love did the calendar year but contain a fifth season in that also wouldst thou be making honeydew faces at somebody but young hubert only grinned and closed his flashing eyes a little in satisfaction at the character which had been given him time presses sir francis said by noon we shall receive an important visit there has been a great sensation at wantley the country folk are aroused the farmers have discovered that the secret of our legend has been revealed to miss elaine not one of the clowns would have dared reveal it himself but all rejoice in the bottom of their hearts that she knows it and chooses to risk battle with the dragon their honest saxon minds perceive the thrift of such an arrangement therefore there is general anxiety and disturbance to know if sir godfrey will permit the conflict the loss of his malvoisie tried him sorely but he remains a father thats kind in him said hubert sir francis turned a cold eye on hubert as befits a cleanblooded man he proceeded i have risen at the dawn and left you winepots in your thick sleep from the woods edge over by wantley ive watched the baron come eagerly to an upper window in his white nightshift and when he looks out on mistletoe and sees she is not devoured he bursts into a rage that can be plainly seen from a distance these six mornings i laughed so loud at this spectacle that i almost feared discovery next the baron visits his daughter only to find her food untasted and herself silent i fear she is less of a fool than the rest but now his paternal heart smites him and he has let her out also the governess is free such a girl as that would not flinch from meeting our dragon said hubert aye or from seeking him she must never meet the dragon sir francis declared what could i do shut up in the crocodile and she with a sword of course they were gloomily silent i could not devour her properly as a dragon should nor could i carry her away pursued sir francis here hubert who had gone to the window returned hastily exclaiming they are coming who are coming asked several the baron his daughter the governess and all wantley at their backs to ask our pious advice said the grand marshal quick into your gowns one and all be monks outside though you stay men underneath for a while the hall was filled with jostling gray figures entangled in the thick folds of the gowns into which the arms legs and heads had been thrust regardless of direction the armour clashed invisible underneath as the hot and choked members of the guild plunged about like wild animals sewed into sacks in their struggles to reappear in decent monastic attire the winged crocodile was kicked into the closet after it were hurled the thunder machine and the lightning torch and after them clattered the cups and the silver rundlet barely had hubert turned the key when knocking at the faroff gate was heard go down quickly hubert said the grand marshal and lead them all here presently the procession of laity gravely escorted by hubert began to file into the now barrenlooking room while the monks stood with hands folded and sang loudly what sounded to the uninstructed ears of each listener like a latin hymn illustration illustration chapter v in which the hero makes his first appearance is at once locked up illustration father anselm sir godfrey with the respect that was due to holy men sir godfrey removed his helmet and stood waiting in a decent attitude of attention to the hymn although he did not understand a single word of it the long deliberate latin words rolled out very grand to his ear and to tell you the truth it is just as well his scholarship was faulty for this is the english of those same words it is my intention to die in a tavern with wine in the neighbourhood close by my thirsty mouth that angels in chorus may sing when they reach me let bacchus be merciful unto this winebibber but so devoutly did the monks dwell upon the syllables so earnestly were the arms of each one folded against his breast that you would never have suspected any unclerical sentiments were being expressed the proximity of so many petticoats and kirtles caused considerable restlessness to hubert but he felt the burning eye of the grand marshal fixed upon him and sang away with all his might sir godfrey began to grow impatient hem he said moving his foot slightly this proceeding however was without result the pious chant continued to resound and the monks paid not the least attention to their visitors but stood up together in a double line vociferating latin with as much zest as ever mort daieul growled sir godfrey shifting his other foot and not so gingerly this second time by chance the singing stopped upon the same instant so that the barons remark and the noise his foot had made sounded all over the room this disconcerted him for he felt his standing with the church to be weak and he rolled his eyes from one side to the other watching for any effect his disturbance might have made but with the breeding of a true man of the world the grand marshal merely observed benedicite my son goodmorning father returned sir godfrey and what would you with me pursued the socalled father anselm speak my son well the fact is the baron began marching forward but he encountered the eye of the abbot where shone a cold surprise at this overfamiliar fashion of speech so he checked himself and in as restrained a voice as he could command told his story how his daughter had determined to meet the dragon and so save wantley how nothing that a parent could say had influenced her intentions in the least and now he placed the entire matter in the hands of the church which would have been more becoming if you had done it at the first said father anselm reprovingly then he turned to miss elaine who all this while had been looking out of the window with the utmost indifference how is this my daughter he said gravely in his deep voice oh the dear blessed man whispered mistletoe admiringly to herself it is as you hear father said miss elaine keeping her eyes away and why do you think that such a peril upon your part would do away with this dragon says not the legend so she replied and what may the legend be my daughter with some surprise that so well informed a person as father anselm should be ignorant of this prominent topic of the day sir godfrey here broke in and narrated the legend to him with many vigourous comments ah yes said the father smiling gently when the story was done i do now remember that some such childs tale was in the mouths of the common folk once but methought the nonsense was dead long since the nonsense father exclaimed elaine of a surety my child dost suppose that holy church were so unjust as to visit the sins of thy knightly relatives upon the head of any weak woman who is not in the order of creation designed for personal conflict with men let alone dragons bravo dragon thought hubert as he listened to this wily talk of his chief but the words weak woman had touched the pride of miss elaine i know nothing of weak women she said very stately but i do know that i am strong enough to meet this dragon and moreover firmly intend to do so this very night peace my daughter said the monk and listen to the voice of thy mother the church speaking through the humblest of her servants this legend of thine holds not a single grain of truth tis a conceit of the common herd set afoot by some ingenious fellow who may have thought he was doing a great thing in devising such fantastic mixture true it is that the monster is a visitation to punish the impiety of certain members of thy family true it is that he will not depart till a member of that family perform a certain act but it is to be a male descendant now sir godfreys boy roland was being instructed in knightly arts and conduct away from home who told you that inquired the baron as the thought of his precious winecellar came into his head on last christmas eve i had a vision replied father anselm thy grandfather the brave youth who by journeying to the holy war averted this curse until thine own conduct caused it to descend upon us appeared to me in shining armour anselm he said and raised his right arm the dragon is a grievous burden on the people i can see that from where i am now anselm when the fitting hour shall come and my greatgrandsons years be mature enough to have made a man of him let him go to the next holy war that is proclaimed and on the very night of his departure the curse will be removed and our family forgiven more than this anselm if any male descendant from me direct shall at any time attend a crusade when it is declared the country will be free forever so saying he dissolved out of my sight in a silver gleaming mist here father anselm paused and from under his hood watched with a trifle of anxiety the effect of his speech there was a short silence and then sir godfrey said am i to understand this thing hangs on the event of another crusade the abbot bowed meanwhile till that event happen the dragon can rage unchecked the abbot bowed again will there be another crusade along pretty soon sir godfrey pursued these things lie not in human knowledge replied father anselm he little dreamed what news the morrows sun would see oh my sheep groaned many a poor farmer oh my burgundy groaned sir godfrey in that case exclaimed elaine her cheeks pink with excitement i shall try the virtue of the legend at any rate most impious my daughter most impious will such conduct be in the sight of mother church said father anselm hear me all people shouted sir godfrey foreseeing that before the next crusade came every drop of wine in his cellar would be swallowed by the dragon hear me proclaim and solemnly promise legend true or legend false my daughter shall not face this risk but if her heart go with it her hand shall be given to that man who by night or light brings me this dragon alive or dead illustration geoffrey replyeth with deplorable flippancy to father anselm a useless promise sir godfrey said father anselm shrugging his shoulders we dare not discredit the word of thy respected grandsire my respected grandsire be what said the abbot became a credit to his family said the baron quite mildly and i slight no word of his but he did not contradict this legend in the vision i think no he did not papa miss elaine put in he only mentioned another way of getting rid of this horrible dragon now papa whatever you may say about about my heart and hand she continued firmly i am going to meet the monster alone myself tonight that you shall not said sir godfrey a hundred times no said a new voice from the crowd i will meet him myself all turned and saw a knight pushing his way through the people who are you inquired the baron the stranger bowed haughtily and elaine watched him remove his helmet and reveal underneath it the countenance of a young man who turned to her and why whats this elaine why does everything seem to swim and grow misty as his eye meets yours and why does he look at you so and deeply flush to the very rim of his curly hair and as his glance grows steadier and more intent upon your eyes that keep stealing over at him can you imagine why his hand trembles on the hilt of his sword dont you remember what the legend said who are you the baron repeated impatiently i am geoffrey son of bertram of poictiers answered the young man and what asked father anselm with a certain irony in his voice does geoffrey son of bertram of poictiers so far away from his papa in this inclement weather the knight surveyed the monk for a moment and then said as thou art not my particular father confessor stick to those matters which concern thee this reply did not please any man present for it seemed to savour of disrespect but elaine lost no chance of watching the youth who now stood alone in the middle of the hall sir francis detected this and smiled with a sly smile will some person inquire of this polite young man he said what he wishes with us show me where this dragon of wantley comes said geoffrey for i intend to slay him tonight indeed sir fluttered elaine stepping towards him a little i hope that is i beg youll do no such dangerous thing as that for my sake for your sake father anselm broke in for your sake and why so what should elaine daughter of sir godfrey disseisin care for the carcase of geoffrey son of bertram of poictiers but elaine finding nothing to answer turned rosy pink instead that rules you out exclaimed the father in triumph your legend demands a maid who never has cared for any man pooh said geoffrey leave it to me seize him shouted sir godfrey in a rage he had ruled out my daughter consistency had never been one of the barons strong points seize him said father anselm he outrages mother church the vassals closed up behind young geoffrey who was pinioned in a second he struggled with them till the veins stood out in his forehead in blue knots but after all one young man of twenty is not much among a band of stout yeomen and they all fell in a heap on the floor pulling and tugging at geoffrey who had blacked several eyes and done in a general way as much damage as he possibly could under the circumstances but elaine noticed one singular occurrence not a monk had moved to seize the young man except one who rushed forward and was stopped as though struck to stone by father anselms saying to him in a terrible undertone hubert simply that word spoken quickly but not before this hubert had brushed against her so that she was aware that there was something very hard and metallic underneath his gray gown she betrayed no sign of knowledge or surprise on her face however but affected to be absorbed wholly in the fortunes of young geoffrey whom she saw collared and summarily put into a cagelike prison whose front was thick iron bars and whose depth was in the vast outer wall of the monastery with a little window at the rear covered with snow the springlock of the gate shut upon him and now said father anselm as the monastery bell sounded once more if our guests will follow us the midday meal awaits us below we will deal with this hothead later he added pointing to the prisoner so they slowly went out leaving geoffrey alone with his thoughts illustration illustration elaine chapter vi miss elaine loses her heart finds something of the greatest importance illustration down stairs the grace was said and the company was soon seated and ready for their midday meal our fare said father anselm pleasantly to sir godfrey who sat on his right is plain but substantial oh ah very likely replied the baron as he received a wooden basin of blackbean broth our drink is the baron lifted his eye hopefully remarkably pure water father anselm continued clement he called to the monk whose turn it was that day to hand the dishes clement a goblet of our wellwater for sir godfrey disseisin one of the large goblets clement we are indeed favoured baron in having such a pure spring in the midst of our home oh ah observed the baron again and politely nerved himself for a swallow but his thoughts were far away in his own cellar over at wantley contemplating the casks whose precious gallons the dragon had consumed could it be the strength of his imagination or else why was it that through the chilling unwelcome liquid he was now drinking he seemed to detect a lurking flavour of the very wine those casks had contained his favourite malvoisie father anselm noticed the same taste in his own cup and did not set it down to imagination but afterwards sentenced brother clement to bread and water during three days for carelessness in not washing the monastery tableservice more thoroughly this simple food keeps you in beautiful health father said mistletoe ogling the swarthy face of the abbot with an affection that he duly noted my daughter he replied gravely bodily infirmity is the reward of the glutton i am well thank you meanwhile elaine did not eat much her thoughts were busy and hurrying over recent events perhaps you think she lost her heart in the last chapter and cannot lose it in this one unless it is given back to her but i do not agree with you and i am certain that if you suggested such a notion to her she would become quite angry and tell you not to talk such foolish nonsense people are so absurd about hearts and all that sort of thing no i do not really think she has lost her heart yet but as she sits at table these are the things she is feeling not at all hungry not at all thirsty what a hateful person that father anselm is poor poor young man not that she thinks of him in that way of course the idea horrid father anselm any girl at all no not girl anybody at all who had human justice would feel exactly as she did about the whole matter he was very goodlooking too did he have yes they were blue very very dark blue and a moustache well yes here she laughed but no one noticed her idling with her spoon then her eyes filled with tears and she pretended to be absorbed with the blackbean broth though as a matter of fact she did not see it in the least why had he come there at all it was a perfect shame treating him so perhaps they were not blue after all but oh what a beautiful sparkle was in them after this she hated father anselm worse than ever and the more she hated him the more some very restless delicious something made her draw long breaths she positively must go upstairs and see what he was doing and what he really looked like this curiosity seized hold of her and set her thinking of some way to slip away unseen the chance came through all present becoming deeply absorbed in what sir godfrey was saying to father anselm such a low coarse untaught brute as a dragon he explained cannot possibly distinguish good wine from bad of a surety no responded the monk you agree with me upon that point said the baron most certainly proceed well im going to see that he gets nothing but the cider and small beer after this but how will you prevent him if he visit your cellar again father anselm inquired i shall change all the labels in the first place the baron answered ha vastly well conceived said father anselm you will label your burgundy as if it were beer and next continued sir godfrey i shall shift the present positions of the hogsheads that i shall do today after relabelling in the northern corner of the first wine vault i shall just as he reached this point it was quite wonderful how strict an attention every monk paid to his words they leaned forward forgetting their dinner and listened with all their might one of them who had evidently received an education took notes underneath the table thus it was that elaine escaped observation when she left the refectory illustration the baron setteth forth his plan for circumuenting the dragon as she came upstairs into the hall where geoffrey was caged she stepped lightly and kept where she could not be seen by him all was quiet when she entered but suddenly she heard the iron bars of the cage begin to rattle and shake and at the same time geoffreys voice broke out in rage ill twist you loose he said you rattle shake you kick bang and here the shocking young man used words so violent and wicked that elaine put her hands tight over her ears why he is just as dreadful as papa just exactly she exclaimed to herself whoever would have thought that that angelic face but i suppose they are all like that sometimes and she took her hands away again yes i will twist you loose he was growling hoarsely while the kicks and wrenches grew fiercer than ever or twist myself stark staring blind and oh sir she said running out in front of the cage he stopped at once and stood looking at her his breastplate and gauntlets were down on the floor so his muscles might have more easy play in dealing with the bars elaine noticed that the youths shirt was of very costly eastern silk i was thinking of getting out he said at length still standing and looking at her i thought i might that is you might began miss elaine and stopped upon which another silence followed lady who sent you here he inquired oh they dont know she replied hastily and then seeing how bright his face became and hearing her own words she looked down and the crimson went over her cheeks as he watched her oh if i could get out he said desperately lady what is your name if i might be so bold my name sir is elaine perhaps there is a key somewhere she said and i am called geoffrey he said in reply i think we might find a key elaine repeated she turned towards the other side of the room and there hung a great bunch of brass keys dangling from the lock of a heavy door ah hubert thou art more careless than brother clement i think to have left those keys in such a place quickly did elaine cross to that closed door and laid her hand upon the bunch the door came open the next moment and she gave a shriek to see the skin of a huge lizardbeast fall forward at her feet and also many cups and flagons that rolled over the floor dotting it with little drops of wine hearing elaine shriek and not able to see from his prison what had befallen her geoffrey shouted out in terror to know if she had come to any hurt no she told him and stood eyeing first the crocodiles hide and then the cups setting her lips together very firmly and they were not even dry she said after a while for she began to guess a little of the truth not dry who inquired geoffrey oh geoffrey she burst out in deep anger and then stopped bewildered but his heart leaped to hear her call his name are there no keys he asked keys yes she cried and running with them back to the bars began trying one after another in trembling haste till the lock clicked pleasantly and out marched young geoffrey now what do you suppose this young man did when he found himself free once more and standing close by the lovely young person to whom he owed his liberty did he place his heels together and let his arms hang gracefully and so bow with respect and a manner at once dignified and urbane and say miss elaine permit me to thank you for being so kind as to let me out of prison that is what he ought to have done of course if he had known how to conduct himself like a wellbroughtup young man but i am sorry to have to tell you that geoffrey did nothing of the sort but instead of that behaved in a most outrageous manner he did not thank her at all he did not say one single word to her he simply put one arm round her waist and gave her a kiss geoffrey she murmured dont but geoffrey did with the most astonishing and complacent disobedience oh geoffrey she whispered looking the other way how wrong of you and of me she added a little more softly still escaping from him suddenly and facing about i dont see that said geoffrey i love you elaine elaine darling i oh but you mustnt answered she stepping back as he came nearer illustration geoffrey tuggeth at the bars this was simply frightful and so sudden to think of her elaine but she couldnt think at all happy why how wicked how had she ever no you must not she repeated and backed away still farther but i will said this lover quite loudly and sprang so quickly to where she stood that she was in his arms again and this time without the faintest chance of getting out of them until he should choose to free her it was no use to struggle now and she was still like some wild bird but she knew that she was really his and was glad of it and she looked up at him and said very softly geoffrey we are wasting time oh no not at all said geoffrey but we are say that you love me but havent i ah geoffrey please dont begin again say that you love me she did then taking his hand she led him to the door she had opened he stared at the crocodile at the winecups and then he picked up a sheet of iron and a metal torch i suppose it is their museum he said dont you their museum geoffrey think a little they seem to keep very good wine he remarked after smelling at the demijohn dont you see cant you understand she said no not a bit whats that thing do you suppose he added giving the crocodile a kick oh me but men are simple men are simple said elaine in despair geoffrey listen that wine is my fathers wine from his own cellar there is none like it in all england then i dont see why he gave it to a parcel of monks replied the young man elaine clasped her hands in hopelessness gave him a kiss and became mistress of the situation now geoffrey she said i will tell you what you and i have really found out then she quickly recalled all the recent events how her fathers cellar had been broken into how mistletoe had been chained to a rock for a week and no dragon had come near her she bade him remember how just now father anselm had opposed every plan for meeting the dragon and at last she pointed to the crocodile ha said geoffrey after thinking for a space then you mean of course i do she interrupted the dragon of wantley is now downstairs with papa eating dinner and pretending he never drinks anything stronger than water what do you say to that sir this is a foul thing cried the knight here have i been damnably duped here but speech deserted him he glared at the crocodile with a bursting countenance then drove his toe against it with such vigour that it sailed like a football to the farther end of the hall papa has been duped and everybody said elaine papas french wine they swore to me in flanders i should find a real dragon here he continued raging up and down and giving to the young lady no part of his attention she began to fear he was not thinking of her geoffrey she ventured they swore it they had invited me to hunt a dragon with them in flanders count faux pas and his walloons we hunted day and night and the quest was barren they then directed me to this island of britain in which they declared a dragon might be found by any man who so desired they lied in their throats i have come leagues for nothing here he looked viciously at the distant hide of the crocodile but i shall slay the monk he added a masquerading caitiff lying varlets and all for nothing the monk shall die however have you come for nothing geoffrey murmured elaine three years have i been seeking dragons in all countries chasing deceit over land and sea and now once more my dearest hope falls empty and stale why whats this a choking sound beside him stopped the flow of his complaints oh geoffrey oh miserable me the young lady was dissolved in tears elaine dearest dont you said you had come for n nothing and it was all st stale ha i am a fool indeed but it was the dragon dearest i had made so sure of an honest one in this adventure oh oh went miss elaine with her head against his shoulder there there youre sweeter than all the dragons in the world my little girl said he and although this does not appear to be a great compliment it comforted her wonderfully in the end for he said it in her ear several times without taking his lips away yes he continued i was a fool by your fathers own word youre mine i have caught the dragon come my girl well down to the refectory forthwith and denounce him with this he seized elaines hand and hastily made for the stairs but hold geoffrey hold oh i am driven to act not as maidens should sighed elaine he it is who ought to do the thinking but dear me he does not know how do you not see we should both be lost were you to try any such wild plan not at all your father would give you to me oh no no geoffrey indeed papa would not his promise was about a dragon a live or a dead dragon must be brought to him even if he believed you now even if that dreadful father anselm could not invent some lie to put us in the wrong you and i could never that is papa would not feel bound by his promise simply because you did that there must be a dragon somehow how can there be a dragon if there is not a dragon asked geoffrey wait wait geoffrey oh how can i think of everything all at once and elaine pressed her hands to her temples darling said the knight with his arms once more around her let us fly now now they would catch us at once catch us not they with my sword now geoffrey of course you are brave but do be sensible you are only one no i wont even argue such nonsense they must never know about what we have been doing up here and you must go back into that cage at once what and be locked up and perhaps murdered tonight and never see your face again but you shall see me again and soon that is what i am thinking about how can you come in here elaine you must come to me i have it tonight at halfpast eleven come to the cellardoor at the manor and i will be there to let you in then we can talk over everything quietly i have no time to think now the cellar at the manor and how pray shall i get out of that cage cannot you jump from the little window at the back geoffrey ran in to see no he said returning it is many spans from the earth elaine had hurried into the closet whence she returned with a dusty coil of rope here geoffrey quickly put it about your waist wind it so but how clumsy you are he stood smiling down at her and she very deftly wound the cord up and down over and over his body until its whole length lay comfortably upon him now your breastplate quick she helped him put his armour on again and as they were engaged at that singing voices came up the stairs from the distant dininghall the grace she exclaimed they will be here in a moment geoffrey took a last kiss and bolted into his cage she with the keys made great haste to push the crocodile and other objects once more into their hidingplace cups and flagons and all rattled back without regard to order as they had already been flung not two hours before the closetdoor shut and elaine hung the keys from the lock as she had found them halfpast eleven she said to geoffrey as she ran by his cage towards the stairs one more darling please one through the bars he besought her in a voice so tender that for my part i do not see how she had the heart to refuse him but she continued her way and swiftly descending the stairs was found by the company as they came from the hall busily engaged in making passes with sir godfreys sword which he had left leaning near the door a warlike daughter sir godfrey said father anselm ah if i were a man to go on a crusade sighed miss elaine hast thou my daughter said father anselm thought better of thy rash intentions concerning this dragon i am travelling towards better thoughts father she answered but sir francis did not wholly believe the young lady and was not at rest until sir godfrey assured him her good conduct should be no matter of her own choosing you see insinuated the abbot so sweet a maid as yours would be a treat for the unholy beast a meal like that would incline him to remain in a neighbourhood where such dainties were to be found ill have no legends and fools tricks exclaimed the baron she shall be locked in her room tonight not if she can help it thought miss elaine her father had imprudently spoken too loud twere a wise precaution murmured father anselm what are all the vintages of this earth by the side of a loving daughter quite so quite so sir godfrey assented dont you think he added wistfully that another crusade may come along soon ah my son who can say tribulation is our meted heritage were thy thoughts more high the going of thy liquors would not cause thee such sorrow learn to enjoy the pure cold water goodafternoon said the baron when all the guests had departed and the door was shut safe behind them the father and his holy companions broke into loud mirth the malvoisie is drunk up said they tonight well pay his lordships cellars another visit illustration illustration chapter vii shows what curious things you may see if you dont go to bed when you are sent illustration geoffrey to have steered a sudden course among dangerous rocks and rapids and come safe through puts in the breast of the helmsman a calm content with himself for which no man will blame him what in this world is there so lifts one into complacency as the doing of a bold and coolheaded thing let the helmsman sleep sound when he has got to land but if his content overtake him still on the water so that he grows blind to the treacherous currents that eddy where all looks placid to the careless eye let him beware sir francis came in front of the cage where sat young geoffrey inside on the floor the knight had put his head down between his knees and seemed doleful enough aha thought sir francis giving the motionless figure a dark look my hawk is moulting we need scarcely put a hood on such a tersel next he looked at the shut door of the closet and a shaft of alarm shot through him to see the keys hanging for anybody to make use of them that pleased he thought of elaine and her leaving the table without his seeing her go what if she had paid this room a visit perhaps that bird with head under wing in there he mused looking once more at geoffrey is not the simplewitted nestling he looks my son he called but the youth did not care to talk and so showed no sign my son peace be with you repeated father anselm coming to the bars and wearing a benevolent mien geoffrey remained quite still if repentance for thy presumption hath visited thee went on the father hypocrite was the word that jumped to the youths lips but fortunately he stopped in time and only moved his legs with some impatience i perceive with pain my son said father anselm that repentance hath not yet visited thee well twill come and thats a blessing too he added sighing very piously he plays a part pretty well thought geoffrey as he listened so will i then he raised his head how long am i to stay in this place he inquired taking a tone of sullen humour such as he thought would fit a prisoner certainly until thy present unbridled state of sin is purged out of thee replied the father under such a dose as thou art geoffrey remarked that will be soon this is vain talk my son said the abbot were i of the children of this world my righteous indignation pooh said geoffrey would light on thee heavily but we who have renounced the world and its rottenness here his voice fell into a manner of chanting make a holiday of forgiving injuries and find a pleasure even in pain open this door then geoffrey answered and ill provide thee with a whole week of joy nay said father anselm i had never gathered from thy face that thou wert such a knave at least in the matter of countenances i have the advantage of thee the youth observed i perceive continued the father that i must instruct thy spirit in many things submission among others therefore thou shalt bide with us for a month or two that ill not shouted geoffrey forgetting his rфle of prisoner she cannot unlock thee father anselm said with much art slipping elaine into the discourse geoffrey glared at the abbot who now hoped to lay a trap for him by means of his temper so he went further in the same direction her words are vainer than most womens he said though a lover would trust in them of course the knight swelled in his rage and might have made i know not what unsafe rejoinder but the cords that elaine had wound about him naturally tightened as he puffed out and seemed by their pressure to check his speech and bid him be wary so he changed his note and said haughtily because thy cowl and thy gown shield thee presume not to speak of one whose cause i took up in thy presence and who is as high above thee in truth as she is in every other quality and virtue this callow talk my son said the abbot quietly wearies me much lay thee down and sleep thy sulks off if thou art able upon this he turned away to the closet where hung the brass keys and opened the door acrack he saw the hide of the crocodile leaning against it and the overturned cups just as that boy hubert packed them he thought to himself in satisfaction no one has been prying here i flatter myself upon a skilful mornings work i have knocked the legend out of the barons head hell see to it the girl keeps away and as for yon impudent witling in the cage we shall transport him beyond the seas if convenient if not a knife in his gullet will make him forget the dragon of wantley truly i am master of the situation and as his selfesteem grew the grand marshal rubbed his hands and went out of the hall too much pleased with himself to notice certain little drops of wine dotted here and there close by the closet and not yet quite dry which had his eye fallen upon them might have set him athinking so geoffrey was left in his prison to whatever comfort meditation might bring him and the monks of oysterlemain took off their gowns and made themselves ready for another visit to the winecellars of wantley manor the day before christmas came bleakly to its end over dingle and fen and the last gray light died away yet still you could hear the hissing snow beat down through the bramblethorn and the dry leaves after evening was altogether set in hubert brought the knight a supper that was not a meal a hungry man might be over joyful at seeing yet had hubert in a sort of fellowship towards one who seemed scarcely longer seasoned in manhood than himself and whom he had seen blacken eyes in a very valiant manner secretly prepared much better food than had been directed by his worship the abbot the prisoner feigned sleep and started up at the rattle which the plate made as it was set down under his bars is it morning he asked morning forsooth hubert answered three more hours and we reach only midnight and both young men for different reasons wished in their hearts it were later thou speakest somewhat curtly for a friar said geoffrey alas i am but a novice brother whined the minstrel and fall easily back into my ancient and godless syntax there is food pax vobiscum son of the flesh then hubert went over to the closet and very quietly unlocking the door removed the crocodile and the various other implements that were necessary in bringing into being the dread dragon of wantley he carried them away to a remote quarter of the monastery where the guild began preparations that should terrify any superstitious witness of their journey to get the barons wine geoffrey solitary and watchful in his chilly cage knew what work must be going on and waited his time in patience illustration elaine cometh into the cellar at supper over at wantley there was but slight inclination to polite banter only the family chaplain mindful that this was christmas eve attempted to make a little small talk with sir godfrey christmas he observed to the baron is undoubtedly coming as the baron did not appear to have any rejoinder to this the young divine continued pleasantly though indeed he said we might make this assertion upon any day of the three hundred and sixtyfive and i think remain accurate the celery growled the baron looking into his plate quite so cried the chaplain cheerily he had failed to catch the remark though of course everything does depend on ones point of view after all that celery whelpdale roared sir godfrey the terrified buttons immediately dropped a large venison pasty into mrs mistletoes lap she having been somewhat tried of late began screeching whelpdale caught up the celery and blindly rushed towards sir godfrey while popham foreseeing trouble rapidly ascended the sideboard the baron stepped out of whelpdales path and as he passed by administered so much additional speed that little buttons flew under the curtained archway and down many painful steps into the scullery and was not seen again during that evening when sir godfrey had reseated himself it seemed to the rev hucbald such was the chaplains name that the late interruption might be well smoothed over by conversation so he again addressed the baron to be sure said he taking a manner of sleek clerical pleasantry though we can so often say christmas is coming i suppose that if at some suitable hour tomorrow afternoon i said to you christmas is going you would grant it to be a not inaccurate remark the baron ate his dinner i think so pursued the rev hucbald yes and by the way i notice with pleasure that this snow which falls so continually makes the event of a green christmas most improbable indeed of course the proverb is familiar to you the graveyards should certainly not be fat this season i like a lean graveyard smiled the rev hucbald i hate a fool exclaimed sir godfrey angrily after this the family fell into silence sir godfrey munched his food brooding gloomily over his plundered winecellar mrs mistletoe allowed fancy to picture herself wedded to father anselm if only he had not been a religious person and elaines thoughts were hovering over the young man who sat in a cage till time came for him to steal out and come to her but the young lady was wonderfully wise nevertheless papa she said as they left the banquethall if it is about me youre thinking do not be anxious any more at all well well whats the matter now said the baron papa dear began elaine winsomely pulling at a tassel on his diningcoat do you know ive been thinking think some more then he replied it will come easier when youre less new at it now papa just when ive come to say when i want when you its very hard and here the artful minx could proceed no further but turned a pair of shining eyes at him and then looked the other way blinking rapidly oh good lord muttered sir godfrey staring hard at the wall papa its about the dragon and ive been wrong very wrong yes i know i have i was foolish she was silent again was she going to cry after all the baron shot a nervous glance at her from the corner of his eye then he said hum he hoped very fervently there were to be no tears he desired to remain in a rage and lock his daughter up and not put anything into her stocking this christmas eve and here she was threatening to be sorry for the past and good for the future and everything a parent could wish never mind you cant expect to get off as easily as all that she had been very outrageous now he would be dignified and firm of course i should obey father anselm she continued you should obey me said sir godfrey and i do hope another crusade will come soon dont you think they might have one papa how happy i shall be when your wine is safe from that horrid dragon dont speak of that monster shouted the baron forgetting all about firmness and dignity dont dare to allude to the reptile in my presence look here he seized up a great jug labelled chвteau lafitte and turned it upside down why its empty said elaine ha snorted the baron empty indeed then he set the jug down wrong side up and remained glaring at it fixedly while his chest rose and fell in deep heavings dont mind it so much papa said elaine coming up to him this very next season will mistletoe and i brew a double quantity of cowslip wine brrrrooo went sir godfrey with a shiver and im sure theyll have another crusade soon and then my brother roland can go and the drag and the curse will be removed of course i know that is the only way to get rid of it if father anselm said so i was very foolish and wrong indeed i was said she and looked up in his face with eyes where shone such dear good sweet innocent daughterly affection that nobody in the wide world could have suspected she was thinking as hard as she could think if only he wont lock me up if only he wont but oh its dreadful in me to be deceiving him so there there said the baron and cleared his throat then he kissed her where were firmness and dignity now he let her push him into the chimneycorner and down into a seat and then what did this sly shocking girl do but sit on his knee and tell him nobody ever had such a papa before and she could never possibly love any one half so much as she loved him and werent he and she going to have a merry christmas tomorrow how about that pretty young man hey what said sir godfrey in high goodhumour who snapped elaine i think this girl knows he answered adopting a roguish countenance oh i suppose you mean that little fellow this morning pooh ho ho said her father ho ho little fellow he was a pretty large fellow in somebodys eyes i thought what are you so red about ho ho and the baron popped his own eyes at her with vast relish really papa said miss elaine rising from his knee with much coldness i hardly understand you i think if you find it amusing and you seem to to pretend that i she said no more but gave a slight and admirable toss of the head and now i am very sleepy she added what hour is it sir godfrey took out his grandfathers sundial and held it to the lamp bless my soul he exclaimed its twentytwo oclock thats ten at night nowadays young people and much too late for you to be downstairs any of you get to your bed at once continued sir godfrey or youll never be dressed in time for chapel on christmas morning so elaine went to her room and took off her clothes and hung up her stocking at the foot of the bed did she go to sleep not she she laid with eyes and ears wide open and now alone here in the dark where she had nothing to do but wait she found her heart beating in answer to her anxious and expectant thoughts she heard the wind come blustering from far off across the silent country then a snore from mistletoe in the next room made her jump twice a bar of moonlight fell along the floor wavering and weak then sank out and the pat of the snowflakes began again after a while came a step through the halls to her door and stopped she could scarcely listen so hard she was breathing was her father going to turn the key in her door after all no such thought was any longer in his mind she shut her eyes quickly as he entered his candle shone upon her quiet head that was nearly buried out of sight then laughter shook him to see the stocking and he went softly out he had put on his bedroom slippers but as he intended to make a visit to the cellar before retiring it seemed a prudent thing to wear his steel breastplate and over this he had slipped his quilted red silk dressinggown for it was a very cold night illustration geoffrey goeth to meet the dragon was there a sound away off somewhere outofdoors no he descended heavily through the sleeping house when the candle burned upright and clear yellow his gait was steady but he started many times at corners where its flame bobbed and flattened and shrunk to a blue sickly rag half torn from the wick ouf mort daieul he would mutter but i must count my wine tonight and so he came down into the wide cellars and trod tiptoe among the big round tuns with a wooden mallet he tapped them and shook his head to hear the hollow humming that their emptiness gave forth no oath came from him at all for the matter was too grievous the darkness that filled everywhere save just next to the candle pressed harder and harder upon him he looked at the door which led from inside here out into the night and it was comfortable to know how thick were the panels and how stout the bolts and hinges i can hold my own against any man and have jousted fairly in my time he thought to himself and touched his sword but um the notion of meeting a fiery dragon in combat spoke loudly to the better part of his valour suddenly a great rat crossed his foot ice and fire went from his stomach all through him and he sprang on a wooden stool and then found he was shaking soon he got down with sweaty hands am i getting a coward he asked aloud he seized the mallet that had fallen and struck a good knock against the nearest hogshead ah ha this one at least was full he twisted the wooden stop and drank what came from the hollow of his hand it was cowslip wine ragingly he spluttered and gulped and then kicked the bins with all his might while he was stooping to rub his toe who should march in but miss elaine dressed and ready for young geoffrey but she caught sight of her father in time and stepped back into the passage in a flutter good heavens this would never do geoffrey might be knocking at the cellardoor at any moment her papa must be got away at once papa papa she cried running in sir godfrey sprang into the air throwing mallet and candle against the winebutts then he saw it was only his daughter wretched girl you you if you dont want to become an orphan never tamper like that with my nerves again in your life what are you come here for how dare you leave your bed at such an hour oh mercy forgive us whimpered a new voice there was mistletoe at the door of the passage a candle lifted high above her head and wobbling so that it shook the grease all over her nightcap with the other hand she clutched her camisole while beneath a yellow flannel petticoat her fat feet were rocking in the rawwool footmittens she wore oh dear oh sir godfrey oh me said she saint charity what do you want holy ragbag whats the matter is everybody in my house going stark mad here the baron fell over the stool in the dark give me my candle he roared light my candle what business have either of you to come here please sir its miss elaine i came for oh me ill catch my death of cold her door shutting waked me upstairs oh dear where are we coming to you old mattrass said sir godfrey then he turned to his daughter but this young lady had had a little time to gather her thoughts in so she cut short all awkward questionings with excellent promptness papa she began breathlessly there i heard it again heard it what cried the baron his eyes starting it waked me upstairs and i ran to get you in your room and you it it whats it what waked you broke in sir godfrey his voice rising to a shriek there it is again exclaimed elaine clasping her hands hes coming i hear him the dragon oh with this she pretended to rush for the passage where the squeaks of mistletoe could be heard already growing distant in the house away bolted sir godfrey after her shouting to elaine in terror undisguised lock your door lock your door as he fled upstairs so there stood miss elaine alone with the coast clear and no danger from these two courageous guardians then came a knock from outside and her heart bounded as she ran through the cellar and undid the door you darling said geoffrey jumping in with legs all covered with snow he left the door open wide and had taken four or five kisses at the least before she could stop him the moon was out for a while he continued and the snow stopped so i came a long way roundabout that my tracks should not be seen thats good strategy but this strange young lady said no word and looked at him as if she were going to cry why whats the matter dear he asked oh geoffrey i have been deceiving papa so pooh its not to be thought of but i cant help thinking i never supposed i could do so and it comes so terribly easy and im not a bit clever when im good and oh she covered her face and turned away from him stuff and nonsense geoffrey broke out do be reasonable here is a dragon isnt there yes and everybody wants to get rid of him yes and hes robbing your father yes so youre acting for your fathers good y yes then now geoffrey all your talking doesnt hide the badness in the least bit she was silent again then suddenly seemed greatly relieved i dont care she declared papa locked me up for a whole week when all i wanted was to help him and everybody get rid of the dragon and i am too old to be treated so and now i am just going to pretend theres a dragon when theres not oh whats that this time it was no sham faint and far from the direction of oysterlemain came the roar of the dragon of wantley over fields and farms illustration chapter viii contains a dilemma with two simply egregious horns illustration run instantly into the house said geoffrey to elaine and he dragged out his sword but she stared at him and nothing further or no stay here and see me kill him the boy added pridefully kill him said she in amazement do you suppose that papa with all his experience couldnt tell it was an imitation dragon and you talk of strategy i have thought much about tonight and geoffrey you must do just the thing that i bid you and nothing else promise i think well hear first what your wisdom is said he shaking his head like the sage youth that he was promise she repeated else i go away at once and leave you now one two thrrr i promise he shouted sh papas window is just round the tower now sir you must go over yonder within those trees where there where the snow has dipped the branches low down and leave me alone in the cellar with the dragon with the dragon alone i did not know you counted me a lunatic replied geoffrey then after a look over the fields where the storm was swirling he gave attention to the point of his sword wheres your promise said she will you break your word so soon a big gust of wind flung the snow sharp against their faces did you expect began the young knight and then said some words that i suppose gentlemen in those old times were more prone to use before ladies than they are today which shows the optimists are right then still distant but not so distant came another roar geoffrey elaine said laying a hand upon his arm indeed you must hear me now and make no delay with contrary notions there is no danger for me look he will first be by himself to clear the way of watchers no one peeps out of windows when the dragons howling next the rest will come and all go into papas cellar for the wine but we must get these others away and thats for you she paused well well he said it will go thus the passage shall hide me and the door of it be shut youll watch over by the trees and when you see all have come inside here make some sort of noise at the edge of the wood what sort of noise oh not as if you suspected seem to be passing by play you are a villager going home late when they hear that theyll run away for fear of their secret the dragon will surely stay behind why will he stay behind why will they run away dear geoffrey dont you see that if these men were to be seen in company with the dragon by one who till now knew them as monks where would their living be gone to of course they will get themselves out of sight and the dragon will remain as a sort of human scarecrow then ill come out from the passagedoor one would almost think you desired that villain to kill you said geoffrey no indeed ill not consent to that part how shall he kill me here elaine replied do you not see the dragon of wantley would have to carry a maiden away he would not dare to put me to the sword when i come i shall speak three words to him before there is time for him to think what to do you will hear me say for you must have now run up from the wood the legend has come true then when i tell him that do you walk in ready with your sword to keep him polite oh indeed said the lady with her eyes sparkling on geoffrey we must keep his manners good for him for i think hes one of those persons who might turn out very rude in a trying situation all this was far from pleasing to young geoffrey but elaine showed him how no other way was to be found by which sir francis could be trapped redhanded and distant from help while the knight was bending his brows down with trying to set his thoughts into some order that should work out a better device a glare shone over the next hill against the falling flakes quick said elaine she withdrew into the cellar on the instant and the great door closed between them geoffrey stood looking at it very anxiously and then walked backwards keeping close to the walls and so round the tower and into the court whence he turned and ploughed as fast as he could through the deep drifts till he was inside the trees if they spy my steps he thought it will seem as though some one of the house had gone in there to secure the door once more the glare flashed against the swiftlydescending curtains of the storm slowly it approached sometimes illuminating a treetrunk for a moment then suddenly gleaming on the white mounds where rocks lay deeply cloaked he is pretty slow said geoffrey shifting the leg he was leaning on illustration the dragon thinketh to slake his thirst a black mass moved into sight and from it came spoutings of fire that showed dark jagged wings heavily flapping it walked a little and stopped then walked again geoffrey could see a great snout and head rocking and turning dismal and unspeakable sounds proceeded from the creature as it made towards the cellardoor after it had got close and leaned against the panels in a toppling swaying fashion came a noise of creaking and fumbling and then the door rolled aside upon its hinges next the blurred white ridge towards oysterlemain was darkened with moving specks that came steadily near and man by man of the guild reached the open door crouching whispered a word or two and crept inside they made no sound that could be heard above the hissing of the downward flakes and the wind that moaned always but louder sometimes only elaine with her ear to the cold iron keyhole of the passagedoor could mark the clink of armour and shivered as she stood in the dark and now the cellar is full but not of gray gowns the candle flames show little glistening sparks in the black coats of mail and the sight of themselves cased in steel and each bearing an empty keg stirred a laughter among them then the kegs were set down without noise on the earthy floor among the bins the dragon was standing on his crooked scaly hindlegs and to see the grim changeless jaw and eyes brought a dead feeling around the heart but the two bungling forepaws moved upwards shaking like a machine and out of a slit in the hide came two white hands that lifted to one side the brown knarled mask of the crocodile there was the black head of sir francis almoign tis hot in there he said and with two fingers he slung the drops of sweat from his forehead wet thy whistle before we begin said hubert filling a jug for him sir francis took it in both hands and then clutched it tightly as a sudden singing was set up out in the night come take a wife come take a wife ere thou learnest ages treasons the tune came clear and jolly cutting through the muffled noises of the tempest blood and death muttered hubert each figure had sprung into a stiff position of listening quit thy roving shalt by loving not wax lean in stormy seasons ho ho oh ho not wax lean in here the strain snapped off short then a whining voice said oh i have fallen again a curse on these roots lucifer fell only once and twas enough for him i have looked on the wine when it was red and my dame jeanie will know it soon oh soon but my sober curse on these roots thats nothing said hubert theres a band of christmas singers has strolled into these parts to chant carols one of them has stopped too long at the tavern do i see a light said the voice help give me a light and let me go home quit thy roving shalt by loving shall i open his throat that he may sing the next verse in heaven hubert inquired no fool said sir francis who knows if his brother sots are not behind him to wake the house this is too dangerous tonight away with you every one stoop low till ye are well among the fields and then to oysterlemain ill be dragon for a while and follow after quickly catching up his keg each man left the cellar like a shadow geoffrey from the edge of the wood saw them come out and dissolve away into the night with the tube of the torch at his lips sir francis blew a blast of fire out at the door then covered his head once more with the grinning crocodile he roared twice and heard something creak behind him so turned to see what had made it there was miss elaine on the passagesteps her lips moved to speak but for a short instant fear put a silence upon her that she found no voice to break he with a notion she was there for the sake of the legend waved his great paws and trundled towards where she was standing do not forget to roar sir said the young lady managing her voice so there was scarce any tremble to be heard in it at this the dragon stood still you perceive she said to him after all a dragon like a mouse comes to the trap not quite yet cried sir francis in a terrible voice and rushed upon her meaning death the legend has come true she loudly said a gleaming shaft of steel whistled across the sight of sir francis halt there thundered geoffrey leaping between the two and posing his sword for a lunge my hour has come sir francis thought for he was cased in the stiff hide and could do nothing in defence now shalt thou lick the earth with thy lying tongue said geoffrey a sneer came through the gaping teeth of the crocodile valiant indeed the voice said very valiant and knightly oh son of bertram of poictiers frenchmen know when to be bold ha ha crawl out of that nut thou maggot answered geoffrey and taste thy doom here was a chance the gift of a fool the two white hands appeared and shifted the mask aside letting them see a cunning hope on his face do not go further sir said elaine it is for the good of us all that you abide where you are as i shall explain what is this elaine said geoffrey your promise she answered lifting a finger at him there was a dry crack from the crocodiles hide villain cried geoffrey seizing the halfextricated body by the throat thy false skin is honester than thyself and warned us back inside the robbers eyes shrivelled to the size of a snakes as with no tenderness the youth grappled with him still entangled and with hands feet and knees drove him into his shell as a hasty traveller tramples his effects into a packingcase see said elaine how pleasantly we two have you at our disposal shall the neighbours be called to have a sight of the dragon what do you want with me said sir francis quietly for he was a philosopher in the first place answered geoffrey know that thou art caught and if i shall spare thee this night it may well be theyll set thy carcase swinging on the gallowstree tomorrow morning or being christmas the day after i can see my case without thy help sir francis replied what next at this elaine came to geoffrey and they whispered together illustration the dragon perceiueth hymself to be entrapped thy trade is done for said the youth at length therell be no more monks of oysterlemain and no more dragon of wantley but thou and the other curs may live if ye so choose through what do i buy my choice through a further exhibition of thine art thou must play dragon tonight once again for the last time this that i may show thee captive to sir godfrey disseisin and in chains i think added elaine there is one behind the post it had belonged in the bearpit during the lives of orlando crumb and furioso bun two bears trapped expressly for the baron near roncevaux after which inquired sir francis thou shalt go free and i will claim this ladys hand from her father who promised her to any man that brought the dragon to him dead or alive papa shall be kept at a distance from you said elaine and will never suspect in this dimness if you roar at him thoroughly then continued geoffrey i shall lead thee away as my spoil and the people shall see the lizardskin after a little while but thou must journey far from wantley and never show face again and go from oysterlemain and the tithings exclaimed sir francis my house and my sustenance sustain thyself elsewhere said geoffrey i care not how no said sir francis ill not do this then we call sir godfrey the baron will not love thee very much seeing how well he loves his burgundy thou hast drank thou gavest him sermons on cold springwater hell remember that i think thoult be soon hanging so choose the knight of the voracious stomach was silent this is a pretty scheme thou hast he presently said and not thine own she has taught thee this wit ill be bound mated to her thoult prosper i fear come thy choice said geoffrey sternly a sour smile moved the lips of sir francis well he said it has been good while it lasted yes i consent our interests lie together see how necessity is the mother of friendship also the mask was drawn over his face and they wound the chain about the great body there must be sounds of fighting said elaine make them when i am gone into the house if i had strangled thee in thy prison which was in my mind said the voice of the hidden speaker this folly we but there let it go and begin then they fell to making a wonderful disturbance the dragons voice was lifted in horrid howlings and the young knight continually bawled with all his lungs they chased as children in a game do forward back and across to nowhere knocking the barrels clanking and clashing up between the rows and around corners and the dry earth was ground under their feet and swept from the floor upward in a fine floating yellow powder that they sucked down into their windpipes while still they hustled and jangled and banged and coughed and grew dripping wet so the dust and the water mingled and ran black streams along their bodies from the neck downwards tickling their backs and stomachs mightily when the breath was no longer inside them they stopped to listen the house was stone still and no noise came save always the winds same cheerless blowing how much more of this before they will awaken exclaimed geoffrey in indignation tis a scandal people should sleep so they are saying their prayers said sir francis it is a pity thou art such a miscreant geoffrey said heartily otherwise i could sweat myself into a goodhumour with thee but sir francis replied with coldness it is easy for the upper hand to laugh we must at it again said geoffrey and this time i will let them hear thou art conquered the din and hubbub recommenced and mistletoe could hear it where she quaked inside her closet holding the door with both hands and the baron could hear it he was locked in the bathroom dreadfully sorry he had not gone to the crusade quite unknowingly in his alarm he had laid hold of a cord that set going the showerbath but he gave no heed at all to this trifle and every man and woman in the house heard the riot from the scullion up through the cook to popham who had unstrapped his calves before retiring so that now his lean shanks knocked together like hockeysticks little whelpdale freezing in his shirttail under the bed was crying piteously upon all saints to forget about his sins and deliver him only miss elaine standing in her room listened with calm and she with not much being on the threshold of a chance that might turn untoward so readily presently a victorious shouting came from far down through the dark he is mine the voice bellowed i have laid him low the dragon is taken at this she hastened to summon sir godfrey why where can he be she exclaimed stopping in astonishment at his room empty and the door open wide down in the cellar the voice continued to call on all people to come and see the dragon of wantley also elaine heard a splashing and dripping that sounded in the bathroom so she ran to the door and knocked you cant come in said the baron angrily papa theyve caught the dragon oh why are you taking your bath at such a time taking my grandmother sir godfrey retorted in great dudgeon but he let the rope go and the shower stopped running go to your room he added i told you to lock your door this dragon but hes caught papa cried elaine through the keyhole dont you hear me geoffsomebody has got him how now said the baron unlocking the door and peering out whats all this his dressinggown was extremely damp for stray spouts from the showerbath had squirted over him fortunately the breastplate underneath had kept him dry as far as it went hum he said after he had listened to the voice in the cellar this is something to be cautious over if the people of this house do not come soon to bear witness of my conquest said the voice in tones of thunder ill lead this dragon through every chamber of it myself damnum absque injuria shrieked sir godfrey and uttered much more horrible language entirely unfit for general use what the jeofailes does the varlet mean by threatening an englishman in his own house i should like to know who lives here i should like to know who i am the baron flew down the entry in a rage he ran to his bedside and pulled his sword from under the pillows where he always kept it at night with his sundial illustration illustration illustration we shall see who is master of this house he said i am not going to does he suppose anybody that pleases can come carting their dragons through my premises get up get up every one he shouted hurrying along the hall with the sword in his right hand and a lantern in his left his slippers were only half on so they made a slithering and slapping over the floor and his speed was such that the quilted red dressinggown filled with the wind and spread behind him till he looked like a huge new sort of bird or an eccentric balloon up and down in all quarters of the house went sir godfrey pounding against every shut door out they came mistletoe from her closet squeaking whelpdale from under his bed the baron allowed him time to put on a pair of breeches wrong side out the cook came and you could hear her panting all the way down from the attic out came the nine housemaids with hair in curlpapers the seven footmen followed meeson and welsby had forgotten their wigs the coachman and grooms and stableboys came in horseblankets and boots and last in the procession old popham one calf securely strapped on and the other dangling disgracefully breathless they huddled behind the baron who strode to the cellar where he flung the door open over in a corner was a hideous monster and every man fell against his neighbour and shrieked at which the monster roared most alarmingly and all fell together again young geoffrey stood in the middle of the cellar and said not a word one end of a chain was in his hand and he waited mighty stiff for the baron to speak but when he saw miss elaine come stealing in after the rest so quiet and with her eyes fixed upon him his own eyes shone wonderfully at the sight of the dragon sir godfrey forgot his late excitement and muttered bless my soul then he stared at the beast for some time can cant he do anything he inquired no said geoffrey shortly he cant not fly up at one for instance i have broken his wing replied the youth i id like to look at him never saw one before said the baron and he took two steps then gingerly he moved another step take care geoffrey cried with rapid alarm the monster moved and from his nostrils as it seemed shot a plume of flame popham clutched the cook and the nine housemaids sank instantly into the arms of the seven footmen without the slightest regard to how unsatisfactorily nine goes into seven good heavens said the baron getting behind a hogshead what a brute perhaps it might be useful if i excommunicated him said the rev hucbald who had come in rather late with his clerical frockcoat buttoned over his pyjamas pooh said the baron as if hed care for that very few men can handle a dragon said geoffrey unconcernedly and stroked his upper lip where a kindlydisposed person might see there was going to be a moustache some day i dont know exactly what you mean to imply by that young man said the baron coming out from behind the hogshead and puffing somewhat pompously why zounds he exclaimed i left you locked up this afternoon and securely how came you here geoffrey coughed for it was an awkward inquiry answer me without so much throatclearing said the baron ill clear my throat as it pleases me replied geoffrey hotly how i came here is no affair of yours that i can see but ask father anselm himself and he will tell you this was a happy thought and the youth threw a look at the dragon who nodded slightly i have a question to ask you sir geoffrey continued taking a tone and manner more polite then he pointed to the dragon with his sword and was silent well said sir godfrey dont keep me waiting i fear your memorys short sir by your word proclaimed this morning the man who brought you this dragon should have your daughter to wife if she if she ha said the baron to be sure though it was hasty hum had i foreseen the matter would be so immediately settled shes a great prize for any lad and youre not hurt either one should be hurt for such a reward you seem entirely sound of limb and without a scratch a great prize theres the dragon replied geoffrey and here am i now sir godfrey was an honourable man when he once had given his word you could hold him to it that is very uncommon today particularly in the matter of contracts he gathered his dressinggown about him and looked every inch a parent elaine he said my dear oh papa murmured that young woman in a dieaway voice geoffrey had just time to see the look in her brown eye as she turned her head away and his senses reeled blissfully and his brain blew out like a candle and he ceased to be a man who could utter speech he stood stockstill with his gaze fixed upon elaine the nine housemaids looked at the young couple with many sympathetic though respectful sighings and the seven footmen looked comprehensively at the nine housemaids sir godfrey smiled and very kindly ah well he said once i but tush youre a brave lad and i knew your father well ill consent of course but if you dont mind ill give you rather a quick blessing this evening tis growing colder come here elaine come here sir there now i hate delay in these matters you shall be married tomorrow hey what you dont object i suppose then why did you jump tomorrow christmas day and every churchbell in the county shall ring three times more than usual once for the holy feast and may the lord bless it always and once for my girls wedding and once for the death and destruction of the dragon of wantley hurrah said the united household well have a nuptials that shall be the talk of our grandchildrens children and after them well have all the people to see and well build the biggest pile of fagots that can be cut from my timber and the dragon shall be chained on the top of it and well cremate him like an ancient only alive well cremate the monster alive elaine jumped geoffrey jumped the chain round the dragon loudly clanked why do you not find this a pleasant plan asked the baron surprised it seems to me sir stuttered geoffrey beating his brains for every next word it seems to me a monstrous pity to destroy this dragon so he is a rare curiosity did you expect me to clap him in a boxstall and feed him inquired the baron with scorn why no sir but since it is i who have tracked stalked and taken him with the help of no other huntsman said geoffrey i make bold to think the laws of sport vest the title to him in me no such thing said sir godfrey you have captured him in my cellar i know a little law i hope the law about wild beasts in poictiers geoffrey began what care i for your knavish and perverted foreign legalities over the sea snorted sir godfrey this is england and our common law says you have trespassed my dear sir said geoffrey this wild beast came into your premises after i had marked him dont dear sir me shouted the baron will you hear the law for what i say i tell you this dragons my dragon dont i remember how trespass was brought against ralph de coventry over in warwickshire who did no more than you have done and they held him and there it was but a little pheasant his hawk had chased into anothers warren and youve chased a dragon so the offence is greater but if remonstrated the youth if a fox fox me no foxes here is the case of ralph de coventry replied sir godfrey looking learned and seating himself on a barrel of beer ralph pleaded before the judge saying et nous lessamus nostre faucon voler а luy et il le pursuy en le garrein tis just your position only twas you that pursued and not your falcon which does not in the least distinguish the cases but said geoffrey again the dragon started not on your premises no matter for that for you have pursued him into my warren that is my cellar my enclosed cellar where you had no business to be and the court told ralph no matter que le feisant leva hors de le garrein vostre faucon luy pursuy en le garrein so theres good sound english law and none of your foppish outlandishries in latin finished the baron vastly delighted at being able to display the little learning that he had for you see very few gentlemen in those benighted days knew how to speak the beautiful language of the law so fluently as that and besides continued sir godfrey suddenly there is a contract what contract asked geoffrey a good and valid one when i said this morning that i would give my daughter to the man who brought me the dragon alive or dead did i say i would give him the dragon too so choose which you will take for both you cannot have at this elaine turned pale as death and geoffrey stood dumb had anybody looked at the dragon it was easy to see the beast was much agitated choose said sir godfrey tis getting too cold to stay here what you hesitate between my daughter and a miserable reptile i thought the lads of france were more gallant come sir which shall it be the lady or the dragon well said geoffrey and his blood and heart stood still and so did elaines and so did another persons i i think i will choose the l lady hurrah cheered the household once more oh lord said the dragon but nobody heard him indeed observed sir godfrey and now well chain him in my bearpit till morning and at noon he shall be burned alive by the blazing fagots let us get some sleep now the cloud of slimlyclad domestics departed with slow steps and many a look of fear cast backward at the captured monster this dragon sir said geoffrey wondering at his own voice will die of thirst in that pit bethink you how deep is his habit of drinking ha i have often bethought me retorted sir godfrey rolling his eyes over the empty barrels but here i am a man of some heart i hope he seized up a bucket and ran to the hogshead containing his daughters native cowslip wine there he observed when the bucket was pretty well filled put that in to moisten his last hours then the baron led the way round the manor to the courtyard where the bearpit was his daughter kept pace with him not easily for the excellent gentleman desired to be a decent distance away from the dragon whom young geoffrey dragged along in the rear illustration hvckbald believes he will take jvst a little sip chapter ix leaues much room for guessing about ch x illustration as they proceeded towards the bearpit having some distance to go goodhumour and benevolence began to rise up in the heart of sir godfrey this is a great thing he said to miss elaine ha an important and joyful occurrence the news of it will fly far yes the young lady replied but without enthusiasm the cattle will be safe now the cattle child my burgundy think of that yes papa the people will come continued the baron from all sides tomorrow why its tomorrow now he cried from all sides they will come to my house to see my dragon and i shall permit them to see him they shall see him cooked alive if they wish it is a very proper curiosity the brute had a wide reputation to hear himself spoken of in the past tense as we speak of the dead was not pleasant to sir francis walking behind geoffrey on all fours i shall send for father anselm and his monks the baron went on hearing this geoffrey started what need have we of them sir he inquired to send for father anselm it was getting worse and worse need of father anselm repeated sir godfrey of course i shall need him i want the parson to tell me how he came to change his mind and let you out oh to be sure said geoffrey mechanically his thoughts were reeling helplessly together with no one thing uppermost not that i disapprove it i have changed my own mind upon occasions but twas sudden after his bundle of sagacity about crusades and visions of my ancestor and what not over there in the morning ha ha these clericals are no more consistent than another person ill never let the father forget this and the baron chuckled besides he said tis suitable that these monks should be present at the burning this dragon was a curse and curses are somewhat of a church matter true said geoffrey for lack of a better reply why bless my soul shouted the baron suddenly wheeling round to elaine at his side so that the cowslip wine splashed out of the bucket he carried its my girls weddingday too i had clean forgot bless my soul y yes papa faltered elaine and you young fellow her father called out to geoffrey with lusty heartiness youre a lucky rogue sir yes sir said geoffrey but not gayly he was wondering how it felt to be going mad amid his whirling thoughts burned the one longing to hide elaine safe in his arms and tell her it would all come right somehow a silence fell on the group as they walked even to the baron who was not a close observer the present reticence of these two newlybetrothed lovers was apparent he looked from one to the other but in the face of neither could he see beaming any of the soft transports which he considered were traditionally appropriate to the hour umph he exclaimed it was never like this in my day then his thoughts went back some forty years and his eyes mellowed from within well cook the dragon first continued the old gentleman and then sir you and my girl shall be married ha ha a great day for wantley the baron swung his bucket and another jet of its contents slid out he was growing more and more delighted with himself and his daughter and her lover and everybody in the world and youre a stout rogue too sir he said built near as well as an englishman i think and thats an excellent thing in a husband the baron continued to talk now and then almost falling in the snow but not permitting such slight mishaps to interrupt his discourse which was addressed to nobody and had a general nature touching upon dragons marriages crusades and burgundy could he have seen geoffreys more and more woebegone and distracted expression he would have concluded his future soninlaw was suffering from some sudden and momentous bodily ill the young man drew near the dragon what shall we do he said in a whisper can i steal the keys of the pit can we say the dragon escaped the words came in nervous haste wholly unlike the bold deliberateness with which the youth usually spoke it was plain he was at the end of his wits why what ails thee inquired sir francis in a calm and unmoved voice this is a simple matter his tone was so quiet that geoffrey stared in amazement but yonder pit he said we are ruined not at all sir francis replied truly thou art a deep thinker first a woman and now thine enemy has to assist thy distress he put so much hatred and scorn into his tones that geoffrey flamed up take care he muttered angrily thats right the prisoner said laughing dryly draw thy sword and split our secret open it will be a fine weddingday thoult have then our way out of this is plain enough did not the baron say that father anselm was to be present at the burning he shall be present yes said the youth but how to get out of the pit and how can there be a dragon to burn if thou art to be father anselm and how he stopped i am full of pity for thy brains said sir francis heres the pit said the voice of sir godfrey bring him along hark said sir francis to geoffrey thou must go to oysterlemain with a message darest thou go alone if i dare retorted geoffrey proudly it is well come to the pit when the baron is safe in the house now they were at the iron door here the ground was on a level with the bottom of the pit but sloped steeply up to the top of its walls elsewhere so that one could look down inside the baron unlocked the door and entered with his cowslip wine which not being a very potent decoction began to be covered with threads of ice as soon as it was set down the night was growing more bitter as its frosty hours wore on for the storm was departed and the wind fallen to silence and the immense sky clean and cold with the shivering glitter of the stars then geoffrey led the dragon into the pit this was a rude and desolate hole and its furniture of that extreme simplicity common to bearpits in those barbarous times from the middle of the stone floor rose the trunk of a tree ragged with lopped boughs and at its top forking into sundry limbs possible to sit among an iron trough was there near a heap of stale greasy straw and both were shapeless white lumps beneath the snow the chiselled and cemented walls rose round in a circle and showed no crevice for the nails of either man or bear to climb by many times had orlando crumb and furioso bun observed this with sadness and now sir francis observed it also he took into his chest a big swallow of air and drove it out again between his teeth with a weary hissing i will return at once geoffrey whispered as he was leaving then the door was shut to and sir francis heard the lock grinding as the key was turned then he heard the baron speaking to geoffrey i shall take this key away he said theres no telling what wandering fool might let the monster out and now theres but little time before dawn elaine child go to your bed this excitement has plainly tired you i cannot have my girl look like that when shes a bride today and you too sir he added surveying geoffrey look a trifle out of sorts well i am not surprised a dragon is no joke come to my study and he took geoffreys arm oh no said the youth i cannot i i must change my dress pooh sir i shall send to the tavern for your kit come to my study you are pale well have a little something hot aha something hot but i think geoffrey began tush said the baron you shall help me with the wedding invitations illustration sir francis decideth to go down agayne sir said geoffrey haughtily i know nothing of writing and such low habits why no more do i of course replied sir godfrey nor would i suspect you or any good gentleman of the practice though i have made my mark upon an indenture in the presence of witnesses a man may do that with propriety assented the youth but i cannot come with you now sir tis not possible but i say that you shall cried the baron in high goodhumour i can mull malvoisie famously and will presently do so for you tis to help me seal the invitations that i want you my chaplain shall write them come he locked geoffreys arm in his own and strode quickly forward feeling himself dragged away geoffrey turned his head despairingly back towards the pit oh hes safe enough in there said sir godfrey no need to watch him sir francis had listened to this conversation with rising dismay and now he quickly threw off the crocodile hide and climbed up the tree as the bears had often done before him it came almost to a level with the walls rim but the radius was too great a distance for jumping i should break my leg he said and came down the tree again as the bears had likewise often descended the others were now inside the house elaine with a sinking heart retired to her room and her father after summoning the rev hucbald took geoffrey into his study the chaplain followed with a bunch of goosequills and a large inkhorn and seated himself at a table while the baron mixed some savoury stuff going down his private staircase into the buttery to get the spice and honey necessary heres to the health of all and luck today said the baron and geoffrey would have been quite happy if an earthquake had come and altered all plans for the morning still he went through the form of clinking goblets but his heart ached and his eyes grew hot as he sat dismal and lonely away from his girl whom shall we ask to the wedding queried the rev hucbald rubbing his hands and looking at the pitcher in which sir godfrey had mixed the beverage ask the whole county said sir godfrey the more the merrier my boy roland will be here tomorrow hell find his sister has got ahead of him have some he added holding the pitcher to the rev hucbald i do believe i will take just a little sip returned the divine thanks ah most delicious baron a marriage on christmas day he added is ahem highly irregular but under the unusual indeed the truly remarkable circumstances i make no doubt that the pope drat him said sir godfrey at which the chaplain smiled reproachfully and shook a long transparent taper finger at his patron in a very playful manner saying baron now baron my boy rolands learning to be a knight over at my uncle mortmains continued sir godfrey pouring geoffrey another goblet youll like him but geoffreys thoughts were breeding more anxiety in him every moment ill get the sealingwax observed the baron and went to a cabinet this room is stifling cried geoffrey i shall burst soon i think its my mulled malvoisie youre not accustomed to sir godfrey said as he rummaged in the cabinet open the window and get some fresh air my lad now where the deuce is my family seal as geoffrey opened the window a soft piece of snow flew through the air and dropped lightly on his foot he looked quickly and perceived a mans shadow jutting into the moonlight from an angle in the wall immediately he plunged out through the casement which was not very high merciful powers said the rev hucbald letting fall his quill and spoiling the first invitation what an impulsive young man why he has run clean round the corner tis all my malvoisie said the baron hugely delighted and hurrying to the window come back when youre sober he shouted after geoffrey with much mirth then he shut the window these french heads never can weather english brews he remarked to the chaplain but ill train the boy in time he is a rare good lad now to work out in the snow geoffrey with his sword drawn came upon hubert thou mayest sheathe that knife said the latter and be thy quarry retorted geoffrey i have come too late for that hubert answered thou hast been to the bearpit then oh aye theres big quarry there observed geoffrey tauntingly quite a royal bird so royal the male hawk could not bring it down by himself i hear hubert replied nay theres no use in waxing wroth friend my death now would clap thee in a tighter puzzle than thou art in already and i should be able to laugh down at thee from a better world he added mimicking the priestly cadence and looking at geoffrey half fierce and half laughing he was but an apprentice at robbery and violence and in the bottom of his heart where some honesty still was he liked geoffrey well time presses he continued i must go one thing thou must do let not that pit be opened till the monks of oysterlemain come here we shall come before noon i do not understand said geoffrey illustration brother hvbert goeth back to oysterlemain for ye last time thats unimportant answered hubert only play thy part tis a simple thing to keep a door shut fail and the whole of us are undone farewell nay this is some foul trick geoffrey declared and laid his hand on hubert but the other shook his head sadly dost suppose he said that we should have abstained from any trick thats known to the accumulated wisdom of man our sport is up tis true geoffrey said musingly we hold all of you in the hollow of one hand thou canst make a present of us to the hangman in twenty minutes if thou choosest said hubert though twould put me in quite as evil case ho whats the loss of a woman compared with death hubert exclaimed thoult know some day the young knight said eying hubert with a certain pity that is if ever thou art lucky to love truly and is it so much as that murmured hubert wistfully twas good fortune for thee and thy sweetheart i did not return to look for my master while he was being taken to the pit he continued we could have stopped all your mouths till the day of judgment at least wouldst thou have slain a girl asked geoffrey stepping back not i indeed but for my master i would not be so sure and he says ill come as far as that in time added the apprentice with a shade of bitterness thou art a singular villain said geoffrey and wonderfully frank spoken and so thourt to be married hubert said gently by this next noon if all goes well exclaimed the lover with ardour heigho sighed hubert turning to go twill be a merry christmas for somebody give me thy hand cried geoffrey feeling universally hearty no replied the freebooter what meaning would there be in that i would sever thy jugular vein in a moment if that would mend the broken fortunes of my chief farewell however good luck attend thee the eyes of both young men met and without unkindness in them but i am satisfied with my calling hubert asserted repudiating some thought that he imagined was lurking in geoffreys look quite content its very dull to be respectable look the dawn will discover us but this plan cried geoffrey hastening after him i know nothing thou needest know nothing keep the door of the pit shut farewell and geoffrey found himself watching the black form of hubert dwindle against the white rises of the ground he walked towards the tavern in miserable uncertainty for the brief gust of elation had passed from his heart then he returned irresolute and looked into the pit there was sir francis dressed in the crocodile come in come in young fellow ha ha hows thy head the baron was at the window calling out and beckoning with vigour geoffrey returned to the study there was no help for it we have written fiftynine already said the rev hucbald but the youth cast a dull eye upon the growing heap and sealed them very badly what pleasure was it to send out invitations to his own wedding that might never be coming off as for hubert out in the night he walked slowly through the wide white country and as he went across the cold fields and saw how the stars were paling out and cast long looks at the moon setting across the smooth snow the lads eyes filled so that the moon twinkled and shot rays askew in his sight he thought how the good times of oysterlemain were ended and he thought of miss elaine so far beyond the reach of such as he and it seemed to him that he was outside the comfortable world illustration illustration chapter x the great white christmas at wantley illustration now are all the people long awake and out of their beds wantley manor is stirring busily in each quarter of the house and court and the whole county likewise is agog by seven oclock this morning it was noised in every thatched cottage and in every gabled hall that the great dragon had been captured some said by saint george in person who appeared riding upon a miraculous white horse and speaking a tongue that nobody could understand wherefore it was held to be the language common in paradise some declared saint george had nothing to do with it and that this was the pious achievement of father anselm others were sure miss elaine had fulfilled the legend and conquered the monster entirely by herself one or two hearing the event had taken place in sir godfreys winecellar said they thought the baron had done it and were immediately set down as persons of unsound mind but nobody mentioned geoffrey at all until the barons invitations requesting the honour of various peoples presence at the marriage of his daughter elaine to that young man were received and that was about ten oclock the ceremony being named for twelve that day in the family chapel sir godfrey intended the burning of the dragon to take place not one minute later than halfpast eleven accordingly besides the invitation to the chapel all friends and neighbours whose position in the county or whose intimacy with the family entitled them to a recognition less formal and more personal received a second card which ran as follows sir godfrey disseisin at home wednesday morning december the twentyfifth from half after eleven until the following day dancing also a dragon will be roasted r s v p the disseisin crest with its spirited motto saute qui peult originated by the venerable primer disseisin followed by his son tortious disseisin and borne with so much renown in and out of a hundred battles by a thousand subsequent disseisins ornamented the top lefthand corner i think we shall have but few refusals said the rev hucbald to sir godfrey not many will be prevented by previous engagements i opine and the chaplain smiled benignly rubbing his hands he had published the banns of matrimony three times in a lump before breakfast which is rather unusual he said but under the circumstances we shall easily obtain a dispensation in providing such an entertainment for the county as this will be remarked the baron i feel i have performed my duty towards society for some time to come no one has had a dragon at a private house before me i believe oh surely not simpered the sleek hucbald not even lady jumping jack fiddle grunted the baron she indeed fandangoes shes very pious protested the rev hucbald whom the lady sometimes asked to fish lunches in lent fandangoes repeated the baron he had once known her exceedingly well but she pursued variety at all expense even his as for refusals the chaplain was quite right there were none nobody had a previous engagement or kept it if they had good gracious rupert or cecil or chandos as it might be each dame in the county had exclaimed to her lord on opening the envelope brought by private hand from wantley were asked to the disseisins to see a dragon and his daughter married by heaven muriel well go the gentleman invariably replied under the impression that elaine was to marry the dragon which would be a show worth seeing the answers came flying back to wantley every minute or two most of them written in such haste that you could only guess they were acceptances and those individuals who lived so far away across the county that the invitations reached them too late to be answered immediately rang every bell in the house and ordered the carriage in frantic tones of course nobody kept any engagement sir guy volauvent and none but a most abandoned desperado or advanced thinker would be willing to do such a thing on christmas had accepted an invitation to an ambush at three for the slaying of sir percy de rйsistance but the ambush was put off till a more convenient day sir thomas de brie had been going to spend his christmas at a cockfight in the count de gorgonzolas barn but he remarked to his man edward who brought the trap to the door that the count de gorgonzola might go never mind what he remarked it was not nice though oddly enough it was exactly the same remark that the count had made about sir thomas on telling his own man james to drive to wantley and drop the cockfight all these gentlemen as soon as they heard the great news started for the manor with the utmost speed illustration sir thomas de brie hastens to accept the barons polite inuitation nor was it the quality alone who were so unanimous in their feelings the tenantry to whom sir godfrey had extended a very hospitable bidding to come and they should find standingroom and good meat and beer in the courtyard went nearly mad from every quarter of the horizon they came plunging and ploughing along the sun blazed down out of a sky whence a universal radiance seemed to beat upon the blinding white could you have mounted up birdfashion over the country you would have seen the manor like the centre of some great wheel with narrow tracks pointing in to it from the invisible rim of a circle paths wide and narrow converging at the gate trodden across the new snow from anywhere and everywhere and moving along these like ants all the inhabitants for miles around and through the wide splendour of winter no wind blowing but the sound of chiming bells far and near clear frozen drops of music in the brittle air old gaffer piers the ploughman stumped along pretty well for eighty thanky as he somewhat snappishly answered to the neighbours who outwalked him on the road they would get there first wonderful old man they said as they went on their way and quickly resumed their speculations upon the dragons capture farmer john stiles came driving his oxteam and snuffling for it was pretty cold and his handkerchief at home upon his wagon on every part like swallows hung as many of his relations as could get on his mother who had been lucy baker and grandmother cecilia kempe and a litter of cousin thorpes but his stepfather lewis gay and the children of the halfblood were not asked to ride farmer stiles had bitterly resented the second marriage this family knew all the particulars concerning the dragon for they had them from the cooks second cousin who was courting bridget stiles they knew how saint george had waked father anselm up and put him on a white horse and how the abbot had thus been able to catch the dragon by his tail in the air just as he was flying away with miss elaine and how at that the white horse had turned into a young man who had been bewitched by the dragon and was going to marry miss elaine immediately on the front steps shaking hands with each person who came was sir godfrey he had dressed himself excellently for the occasion something between a heavy father and an old beau with a beautiful part down the back of his head where the hair was geoffrey stood beside him my soninlaw thats to be sir godfrey would say and the gentry welcomed the young man while the tenants bobbed him respectful salutations youre one of us glad to know you said sir thomas de brie surveying the lad with approval lady jumping jack held his hand for a vanishing moment you could hardly make sure of i had made up my mind to hate you for robbing me of my dearest girl she said smiling gayly and fixing him with her oddlooking eyes but i see were to be friends then she murmured a choice nothing to the baron who snarled politely dont let her play you said he to geoffrey when the lady had moved on and he tapped the youths shoulder familiarly oh ive been through all that sort of thing over in poictiers geoffrey answered with indifference youre a rogue sir as ive told you before ha uncle mortmain how dye do yes this is geoffrey wheres my boy roland coming is he well he had better look sharp its after eleven and ill wait for nobody how dye do john stiles that bull you sold me s costing thirty shillings a year in fences youll find something ready down by those tables i think hark to that roar the crowd jostled together in the courtyard for it sounded terribly close the dragons quite safe in the pit good people shouted sir godfrey a few more minutes and youll all see him the old gentleman continued welcoming the new arrivals chatting heartily with a joke for this one and a kind inquiry for the other but wretched geoffrey so the dragon was to be seen in a few minutes and where were the monks of oysterlemain still a bold face must be kept he was thankful that elaine after the custom of brides was invisible the youths left hand rested upon the hilt of his sword he was in rich attire and the curly hair that surrounded his forehead had been carefully groomed halfway up the stone steps as he stood his blue eyes watching keenly for the monks he was a figure that made many a humble nymph turn tender glances upon him old piers the ploughman remained beside a barrel of running ale and drank his health all day for he was a wonderful old man hither and thither the domestics scurried swiftly making preparations some were cooking rare pasties of grouse and ptarmigan goslings and doughbirds some were setting great tables indoors and out and some were piling fagots for the dragons funeral pyre popham with magnificent solemnity and a pair of new calves gave orders to meeson and welsby and kept little whelpdale panting for breath with errands while in and out between everybodys legs and over or under all obstacles stalked the two ravens croak james and croak elizabeth a big white weddingfavour tied round the neck of each to see these grave birds none would have suspected how frequently they had been in the mincepies that morning though popham had expressly ruled in somewhat stilted language that they should take nothink by their bills geoffrey said the baron i think well begin popham tell them to light that fire there the guests are still coming sir said geoffrey no matter it is half after eleven the baron showed his sundial and there was no doubt of it here take the keys he said and bring the monster out for us ill go and put on my armour suggested the young man that would take time perhaps the monks might arrive why the brutes chained you need no armour nonsense but think of my clothes in that pit sir on my weddingday pooh thats the first sign of a frenchman ive seen in you take the keys sir the crackle of the kindling fagots came to geoffreys ears he saw the forty men with chains that were to haul the dragon into the fire but theres father anselm yet to come he protested surely we wait for him illustration ill wait for nobody he with his crusades and rubbish havent i got this dragon and theres no crusade ah cousin modus glad you could come over just in time the sherrys to your left yes its a very fine day yes yes this is geoffrey my girls to marry and all that what do i care about father anselm the old gentleman resumed testily when his cousin modus had shuffled off come sir he gave the keys into geoffreys unwilling hand and ordered silence proclaimed hearken good friends said he and all talk and going to and fro ceased the tenantry stood down in the courtyard a mass of motionless russet and yellow every face watching the baron the gentry swarmed noiselessly out upon the steps behind him their handsome dresses bright against the manor walls there was a short pause old gaffer piers made a slight disturbance falling over with his cup of ale but was quickly set on his feet by his neighbours the sun blazed down and the growling of the dragon came from the pit yonder noise pursued sir godfrey speaks more to the point than i could ill give you no speech all loudly cheered at this dont you think whispered the rev hucbald in the barons ear that a little something serious should be said on such an occasion i should like our brethren to be reminded fudge said the baron for thirteen years he continued raising his voice again this dragon has been speaking for himself you all know and i know how that has been and now we are going to speak for ourselves and when he is on top of that fire hell know how that is geoffrey open the pit and get him out again there was a cheer but a short one for the spell of expectancy was on all the young man descended into the court and the air seemed to turn to a wavering mist as he looked up at the manor windows seeking to spy elaines face at one of them was this to be the end could he kiss her one last goodby if disaster was in store for them after all alas no glimpse of her was to be seen as he moved along hardly aware of his own steps and the keys jingling lightly as he moved through the crowd he passed and a whispering ran in his wake followed by deeper silence than before he reached the edge of the people and crossed the open space beyond passing the leaping blaze of the fagots and so drew near the iron door of the pit the key went slowly into the lock all shrank with dismay at the roar which rent the air geoffrey paused with his hand gripping the key and there came a sound of solemn singing over the fields the monks murmured a few under their breath and silence fell again each listening mens voices it was and their chanting rose by one sudden step to a high note that was held for a moment and then sank again mellow like the harmony of horns in a wood then over the ridge from oysterlemain the length of a slow procession began to grow the gray gowns hung to the earth straight with scarce any waving as the men walked the heavy hoods reached over each face so there was no telling its features none in the courtyard spoke at all as the brooding figures passed in under the gateway and proceeded to the door of the bearpit singing always howlings that seemed born of terror now rose from the imprisoned monster and many thought evidently the evil beast cannot endure the sound of holy words elaine in her white dress now gazed from an upper window seeing her lover with his enemies drawing continually closer around him perhaps it was well for him that his death alone would not have served to lock their secret up again that the white maiden in the window is ready to speak the word and direct instant vengeance on them and their dragon if any ill befall that young man who stands by the iron door the song of the monks ended sir godfrey on the steps was wondering why father anselm did not stand out from the rest of the gray people and explain his wishes though he shall not interrupt the sport whatever he says thought the baron and cast on the group of holy men a less hospitable eye than had beamed on his other guests geoffrey over at the iron door surrounded by the motionless figures scanned each hood narrowly and soon met the familiar eyes of hubert huberts gown he noticed bulged out in a manner ungainly and mysterious open the door whispered that youth at once geoffrey began to turn the key and at its grinding all held their breath and a quivering silence hung over the court the hasty drops pattered down from the eaves from the snow that was melting on the roof then some strip of metal inside the lock sprung suddenly making a sharp song and ceased the crowd of monks pressed closer together as the iron door swung open illustration the dragon maketh his last appearance what did geoffrey see none but the monks could tell instantly a single roar more terrible than any burst out and the huge horrible black head and jaws of the monster reared into the view of sir godfrey and his guests one instant the fearful vision in the doorway swayed with a stiff strange movement over the knot of monks that surrounded it then sank out of sight among them there was a sound of jerking and fierce clanking of chains mingled with loud chanting of pious sentences then a plume of spitting flame flared upward with a mighty roar and the gray figures scattered right and left there along the ground lay the monster shrivelled twisted in dismal coils and dead close beside his black body towered father anselm smoothing the folds of his gray gown geoffrey was sheathing his sword and looking at hubert whose dress bulged out no longer but fitted him as usual we have been vouchsafed a miracle said father anselm quietly to the gaping spectators therell be no burning said geoffrey pointing to the shrunken skin but though he spoke so coolly and repelled all besieging disturbance from the fortress of his calm visage and bearing as a bold and haughty youth should do yet he could scarcely hold his finger steady as it pointed to the blackened carcase then all at once his eyes met those of elaine where she watched from her window and relief and joy rushed through him he stretched his arms towards her not caring who saw and the look she sent him with a smile drove all surrounding things to an immeasurable distance away here indeed father anselm repeated is a miracle lo the empty shell the snake hath shed his skin this is very disappointing said sir godfrey bewildered is there no dragon to roast the roasting replied the abbot impressively is even now begun for all eternity he stretched out an arm and pointed downward through the earth the evil spirit has fled the church hath taken this matter into her own hands and claims yon barren hide as a relic well i dont see why the church cant let good sport alone retorted sir godfrey hope shell not take to breaking up my cockfights this way muttered the count de gorgonzola sulkily the church cares nothing for such profane frivolities observed father anselm with cold dignity at all events friends said sir godfrey cheering up the country is rid of the dragon of wantley and weve got a wedding and a breakfast left just at this moment a young horseman rode furiously into the courtyard it was roland sir godfreys son great news he began at once another crusade has been declared and i am going merry christmas wheres elaine wheres the dragon father anselms quick brain seized this chance he and his monks should make a more stately exit than he had planned see he said in a clear voice to his monks how all is coming true that was revealed to me this night my son he continued turning to young roland thy brave resolve reached me ere thou hadst made it know it has been through thee that the dragon has gone upon this there was profound silence and now he added solemnly farewell the monks of oysterlemain go hence to the holy land also to battle for the true faith behold we have made us ready to meet the toil his haughty tones ceased and he made a sign the gray gowns fell to the snow and revealed a stalwart fiercelooking crew in black armour but the abbot kept his gray gown youll stay for the wedding inquired sir godfrey of him our duty lies to the sea farewell for i shall never see thy face again he turned hubert gathered up the hide of the crocodile and threw a friendly glance back at geoffrey then again raising their song the black band slowly marched out under the gate and away over the snow until the ridge hid them from sight and only their singing could be heard in the distant fields well exclaimed sir godfrey its no use to stand staring now for the wedding mistletoe go up and tell miss elaine hucbald tell the organist to pipe up his music and as soon as its over well drink the brides health and health to the bridegroom tis a lucky thing that between us all the dragon is gone for theres still enough of my burgundy to last us till midnight come friends come in for everything waits your pleasure illustration lenvoi reader if thou hast found thy way thus far sure then ive writ beneath a lucky star and
