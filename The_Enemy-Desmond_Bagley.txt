chapter one an interesting woman i first met penelope ashton at a dinnerparty she was not a beautiful woman but she was welldressed quite pretty and as i quickly realized very intelligent she was a good listener but did not say much herself after dinner i managed to spend a lot of time talking to her i learned that she was a biologist doing research with professor lumsden at university college in london she was an attractive and interesting woman it was late when the party came to an end and i took her to catch the last train home which station does your train go from i asked victoria she replied in the taxi on the way to victoria station i asked her out to dinner she was silent for a moment then said all right wednesday evening after she had hurried off to catch her train i realized i didnt know if she was married or not on the following wednesday i met her at university college at a quarter past seven in the evening do you always work so late i asked she shook her head not always it depends on how my work is going sometimes earlier sometimes later we went to the theatre and had dinner afterwards in a restaurant in soho for me it was a most enjoyable evening and i think it was for penelope too in the next six weeks we went out together several times and i realized that penelope ashton was becoming a serious part of my life one evening we had dinner at my flat i cooked a chinese meal for her and when she told me how much she had enjoyed the meal she also invited me to her home for the weekend to meet her family marlow is a small town on the river thames about an hours drive from london the house where penelope lived with her father and her sister was in the countryside just a few minutes from the town it was a large and beautiful house the kind that you read about in the best magazines it had a big wellkept garden tennis courts and a swimming pool penelopes father george ashton was in his midfifties his wife was dead and he had not married again he was tall greyhaired and very fit as i discovered when he beat me at tennis after the game i was tired but ashton dived in to the swimmingpool for a swim before going back to the house for a shower he was twentyfive years older than i was but i was exhausted from the game of tennis which i had lost i sat down beside penelope is he always like that always so full of energy i asked always she promised her sister gillian was not at all like penelope she was the kind of woman who likes to stay at home and run the house it was a large house with several servants and she organized it very well gillian told the servants what to do she planned the meals and seemed to be very happy it was a friendly family and i soon felt very comfortable with them although i knew that i was there to be inspected we had dinner we talked the girls went to bed and george ashton and i sat and talked for a long time he told me about his two factories which made special kinds of plastic materials then he asked me very politely how i earned my living im an economist i answered i work in a company which studies economic problems and then helps other companies to do their business better we dont work for big companies but lots of smaller ones like yours find our advice useful ashton seemed happy with my answers and the rest of the weekend passed quietly on sunday evening as i was leaving ashton invited me to return the following weekend i was happy to accept i had enjoyed that first family weekend and i had enjoyed their company ashton the rich fit and independent businessman gillian his home loving daughter and penelope the scientist with her own career outside the family the only strange member of the group was benson ashtons personal servant he spoke with a gentle educated accent but his face looked as if he had had far too many fights when he was a young man chapter two acid in the eyes penelope was very busy the next week she worked all friday night and when i met her at the laboratory on saturday morning she looked very tired im going to have to sleep this afternoon malcolm it wont be much of a weekend for you im afraid but im sure my father will keep you busy im sorry but im just very very tired i was sorry too because i was going to ask her to marry me that weekend however it wasnt the right moment to put the question so i asked her what she had been doing all night oh we were doing a very difficult experiment trying to transfer some dangerous genetic material is all this useful i asked does it do any good or is that a state secret oh no secret but its useful all right what were doing is an important part of medical research into cancer she replied once again i spent an enjoyable weekend with the ashtons we swam we played tennis we talked it sounds boring but it was for all of us an important way to relax from the problems of the working week on sunday evening gillian went to church and penelope her father and i sat talking in the garden it was a beautiful summer evening suddenly we heard a scream then another ashton said sharply what the devil was that and we all limped to our feet just as gillian came round the corner of the house holding her hands to her face she screamed again and fell to the grass ashton was the first to reach her he tried to pull her hands from her face but she resisted him with all her strength penelope bent over gillian who was now lying on the grass the screams had stopped and a faint voice murmured my eyes oh my eyes penny put her finger to gillians face and then put it to her nose she turned to her father quick take her into the kitchen quickly she turned to me ring for an ambulance tell them its an acid burn i ran to the telephone as ashton lifted gillian up and earned her to the kitchen i dialled and immediately a voice said emergency services ambulance i gave the address and telephone number its a bad acid burn on the face i said well be there as quickly as we can said the voice i went to the kitchen where penelope was trying to clean gillians face gillian was still murmuring low cries of deep pain i looked at ashton i have never seen such an expression of helpless anger on anyones face but there was nothing i could do there so i went outside benson was looking at the ground near the gate i think someone parked his car here sir and waited for miss gillian he must have thrown acid into her face when she walked into the garden it looks as if he turned the car on the grass then and drove away i looked at the marks on the grass i think youre right i said i ran back to the house dialled again but this time when the voice said emergency services i replied police please i want to report a criminal attack the ambulance arrived very quickly and took gillian and penelope to hospital ashton followed them in his car but before he went i took him to one side ive sent for the police theyll come while youre at the hospital but dont worry about that ill stay here until you come back he seemed not to understand at first and looked at me as if he did not even know me i repeated what i had said and this time he heard me thanks malcolm he replied he looked as if he had grown ten years older in the last fifteen minutes alone in the house i poured myself a drink and sat down to think while i waited for the police nothing made sense gillian ashton was an ordinary young woman who liked living at home looking after her father what possible reason could anyone have for throwing acid in her face i thought about it for a long time and got nowhere after a while a police car arrived i could not tell the two policemen much because i knew very little about gillian and her father and they did not seem very satisfied with what i told them twenty minutes later another car arrived a policeman in plain clothes came in im detective inspector honnister he said are you mr jaggard thats right come in inspector ive got something to show you which im not supposed to let you see but in these circumstances i think i have to show it to you honnister looked puzzled as i gave him my special identity card we dont see many of these mr jaggard theyre rather special have you any ideas about whats happened are you here on business i shook my head no ive got no ideas im not here for professional reasons im just a family guest for the weekend well this looks like the sort of problem were going to have to solve the hard way step by step but ill be glad to have your help mr jaggard ashton and penny came back some hours later penny looked pale and tired but ashton had recovered some of his energy good of you to stay malcolm stay a little longer i want to talk to you not now but later he spoke as if it was an order not a request he went off to his study and i turned to penny hows gillian not good she said sadly it was strong acid what sort of person could do such a terrible thing thats what the police want to know does your father have any enemies i asked daddy she frowned if you become successful youre bound to upset some people so there must be some people who dont like him but not the kind of enemy whod throw acid into his daughters face thats something different i had to agree and we talked as we had our dinner just the two of us shortly afterwards benson came into the room mr ashton would like to see you sir he announced ashton was sitting at his desk a glass of whisky in his hand the bottle in front of him was half empty im so sorry about what has happened i said i know malcolm he agreed but tell me how are things with you and penny were very good friends is that what you mean not exactly what are your plans he replied i intend to ask her to marry me but i havent done so yet he rubbed the side of his face and thought for a moment what about your job is the money good its fairly well paid i replied and i have a private income as well what about the future will you get promoted i think so im trying hard he was silent for a few minutes then he went on i could offer you a better job youd start in australia you and penny but youd enjoy that the only trouble is that youd have to start almost immediately he was going too fast for me just a minute i said i dont even know if shell marry me i havent asked her yet she will he said positively i know my daughter maybe so i replied but id like to know a lot more about this job before i decide and talk about it fully with penny ashton was annoyed but he tried to hide it well we can wait a week or two to decide about australia but you ought to ask her to marry you now i can get you a special licence and you could be married by the end of the week stop i said youre going too fast for me tonight isnt the right time to ask penny to marry me not after what happened to gillian today ashton stood up and walked impatiently around the room youre right of course its between you and penny and its wrong of me to interfere but do ask her to marry you now this evening i stood up mr ashton i dont think that would be a good thing to do especially today i wont do it now ill do it when i think its right i left his study immediately i did not understand why it was suddenly so important for penny and me to marry so quickly there was something wrong and i had no idea what it was penelope was telephoning when i entered the hall ive been talking to the doctors at the hospital she said they say gillians resting more comfortably now good im glad about that look ill come back tomorrow perhaps we can both go to visit her and see how she feels chapter three the mysterious george ashton when i walked into the office on monday morning there was a message on my desk my boss harrison wanted to see me immediately you told a policeman at the weekend who you were he accused me why your job is supposed to be secret i was at a houseparty and something horrible happened acid was thrown in a girls face the police were beginning to look at me suspiciously so i had to tell them who i was they would have wasted a lot of time on me if i hadnt were supposed to cooperate with the police arent we was it really necessary to tell the police about yourself he asked in my opinion i had no choice damn it i wanted to help the police i walked out of his office and went back to my own feeling very angry larry godwin was there we shared an office and were good friends he also knew a great deal about factories and businesses in britain do you know anything about a man called ashton i asked him he runs a factory in slough they make a special kind of plastic material i havent heard of him said larry why dont you ask nellie she knows everything he laughed the computer that our office used was called nellie i forget why in its memory there was an enormous amount of information i sat down in front of the screen pushed a couple of buttons and the words identify yourself appeared on the screen i identified myself and nellie asked information level i answered green all the information in the computer was kept on different levels some people had permission to look only at information which was not very important and not very secret that was level green there was other very secret information which could be seen only by ogilvie the head of the department in between there were several different levels each one known by a colour i typed in ashtons name and address and almost immediately the message came up on nellies screen this information is not available at this level try level yellow i was very surprised i hadnt expected to find anything at all about ashton in the computer memory what nellies message meant was that somewhere in the computer there was a lot of information about george ashton and that information was secret ashton wasnt just an ordinary businessman i typed my identification for level yellow this was more complicated and took me four minutes back came nellies reply this information is not available at this level try level red i sat back to think i knew that information at level red was very secret and i began to wonder about ashton who was he why was everything about him so secret i had permission to see level red but it took me ten minutes to go through the stages to identify myself finally i finished typing and waited for nellie to tell me all about penelopes mysterious father instead of that nellie replied on the screen this information is not available at this level try level purple level purple was too high too secret for me all i had learned about george ashton was that something in his life or work was extremely important and secret a couple of hours later larry and i were talking in our office when the phone rang it was harrison our boss what the hell have you been doing with the computer you fool he demanded nothing much why has it broken down i said whats all this about a man called ashton he continued ogilvie wants to see both of us immediately come on ogilvie was the head of our department he was not alone there was a short fat man sitting in one of the chairs ogilvie didnt introduce him but asked me immediately malcolm why are you so interested in george ashton im going to marry his daughter i replied this statement produced a very surprising response for a minute everybody stared at me in shocked silence then the fat man said why did you think information about ashton might be in the computer no reason i replied i didnt know anything about him and someone suggested just as a joke that i should look in the computer i didnt expect to find even his name there but something strange happened over the weekend and i wanted to find out more about him what happened someone threw acid into his daughters face and the face of the girl you intend to marry interrupted the nameless man no the younger girl gillian later on ashton behaved strangely im not surprised said ogilvie he turned to mr nameless do you think this is serious it could be very serious but i think were lucky we already have an inside man someone in the family mr nameless pointed his cigarette at me now wait a minute i said i dont know what this is all about but ashton is going to be my fatherinlaw im going to be a member of his family you surely arent going to ask me to spy on him were not asking you said mr nameless calmly were telling you what to do forget it im not going to be a spy in my own family mr nameless looked at me in surprise then looked at ogilvie and said i thought you said this man was a good member of your department i dont think i can agree im not worried what you think i replied angrily be quiet malcolm said ogilvie he turned to harrison you can go now joe joe harrison did not look happy as he left as the door closed behind him ogilvie said i think malcolm has made an important point an agent someone working for the department should not be personally involved in a particular case malcolm what do you think of ashton i like him what i know of him hes not an easy man to get to know but ive only met him on two weekends i take your point said mr nameless suddenly more friendly but we must not waste the fact that mr jaggard is on the inside that could be very useful to us before i could object ogilvie said quickly i think that malcolm will investigate what has happened m ashtons family as soon as he understands clearly why he should do so yes replied mr nameless but you mustnt say too much you know the problem and its limits i think we can keep within the limits replied ogilvie coldly mr nameless stood up then thats what ill report when he had gone ogilvie said malcolm you really must be careful about what you say to important officials of the government youre too rich and independentminded you dont care what you say to people luckily i warned his lordship before you came in that youre not an easy person to work with his lordship who i wondered was this man how was he so important what did he have to do with ashton ogilvie went on take things easy now malcolm dont make any difficulties that arent real ones will you do that of course i replied that isnt too much to ask as long as i know what im supposed to do ogilvie invited me to have lunch with him so that i could tell him everything that had happened when i had finished he lit a cigarette and said all right youre a trained detective is there anything unusual about ashton i thought for a moment before replying theres a servant called benson he seems ordinary but ashton doesnt seem to treat him like an ordinary servant ok said ogilvie anything else that was unusual the way he asked me to marry penelope he was in such a hurry he behaved almost like an oldfashioned father with a pregnant daughter you know what i think said ogilvie i think ashton is frightened very frightened not so much for himself but for his daughters ones been attacked and he seems to think that if he can get penny away from him shell be all right thats why he suddenly invented that job in australia for you just a minute i dont understand this i said who is this man ashton why are we so bloody interested in him sorry i cant tell you that but i can tell you what you have to do whats that i asked take good care of the girl that means also looking after the father of course without knowing the reason why you know why youve got to make sure that penelope ashton doesnt get acid thrown in her face but im really guarding ashton yes youre right there and you mustnt let any of them know who you really are or that you work for this department thats going to be difficult i know but i can give you a team of men to help you you mean i have to guard a man and his daughter without telling them that im guarding them ill certainly need help youll get it said ogilvie with a smile doesnt it worry you that youre marrying into such a mysterious family im marrying penelope not her father i replied chapter four family problems later that afternoon i drove to marlow to talk to inspector honnister he looked at me curiously and a little unhappily one of your people has been on the phone to tell me that i mustnt talk to anyone about you there was no need to do that im a policeman so i know how to keep secrets i cursed the stupidity of someone in ogilvies office who had tried to interfere and said to honnister look forget all that nonsense last night i told you i had nothing official to do with ashton it was true then but it isnt true now my office now has a definite interest in him im going to need your help ill be happy to give it as long as you dont try to hide things from me what do you want to know first of all hows the girl were not allowed to talk to her so she must be bad he replied her sisters been at the hospital most of the day have you spoken to ashton i asked yes he says he can think of no possible reason why anyone should attack his daughter in that way he told me nothing of any use replied honnister ill see both of them later i said and ill try to get more information i want to catch that man with the acid does ashton know who and what you are asked honnister no he doesnt and he mustnt find out either i replied thats going to give you an interesting life with you wanting to marry his daughter too i smiled where did you find that information im a good policeman one of the servants in ashtons house was quite happy to talk about you and miss ashton all right tell me a few secrets about ashton weve got very little some time ago one of our policemen talked to him about safety and how to protect his house against burglars a waste of time ashtons house was already almost as well protected as the bank of england that was interesting to know what did ashton have that was so valuable honnister went on dont forget it wasnt george ashton who was attacked it was gillian ashton an acid attack on a woman always makes me wonder about another woman could it be a jealous wife getting her revenge on gillian ive thought of that too penny says its impossible gillian isnt that kind of woman she may be right but you never know its one of the possibilities ive got to try to find out about said honnister of course but i dont think itll lead you to the man who threw the acid you could be right he replied somehow i dont think were going to find this man easily im going to talk to penelope and her father i said shall i meet you later on and tell you what ive learned yes id like that ill be in the bar of the coach and horses between nine and ten oclock see you then when i arrived at ashtons house the gates were closed and i had to ask a guard to let me in neither ashton nor penelope was at home but benson told me that penelope had telephoned to say that she would be home quite soon this is a very bad business sir very bad how does mr ashton seem after the attack i asked him hes upset of course sir very upset bur he seems to be taking it very well he went to his office this morning as usual can i get you a drink sir it was clear that benson did not want me to ask him too many questions about ashton so i asked him to bring me a whisky he did so and left the room penelope arrived before id finished my drink she looked very tired and pale oh malcolm she cried how good to see you hows gillian i asked a little better i think shes getting over the shock im very glad to hear it i talked with inspector honnister the policeman in charge of the case hed like to talk to gillian as soon as possible oh malcolm she isnt ready for that yet its too soon she came close to me and i put my arms around her are her injuries that bad i asked she put her head on my chest for a moment and said you dont realize how bad this sort of thing is for a woman women care much more about their appearance than men gillians got to get over two bad shocks a psychological shock as well as a physical one yes i can understand that but honnister needs to know anything that gillian can tell him at the moment he knows nothing not even if the attacker was a man or a woman penelope looked surprised i hadnt thought of that and gillian hasnt talked about it weve kept off the subject of acidthrowing when you go to the hospital tonight could you see if she can remember anything anything at all about what happened weve got to find this person and its probably better if you talk to her than if honnister does it but he really does need to know what happened maybe gillian can remember something about the acid thrower ill try but i cant promise that shell be able to tell me anything useful penelope went to get dinner ready and i walked around in the garden until ashton came home he looked worried and tired but there was more than that he had the look of a small boy who has just discovered that the world is an unjust place the look of a boy who has been punished for something he hasnt done gillians blind he said shortly oh no im so sorry i replied does she know does penny know neither of them knows and i dont want them to know until gillians strong enough to take the shock so dont tell penny i wont tell her but she might find out for herself dont forget shes a doctor well he said id rather they knew later than sooner what a terrible thing this is malcolm i just cant understand it dont you have any ideas at all i asked i had to start to do my job as a policeman i could also see that ashton was now carrying a gun in a pocket under his arm but i could hardly ask him about that could there be something in gillians life that you dont know about could she have become involved with some unsuitable friends he became angry immediately impossible he said very sharply gillians always been such a good girl ive never had any problems with her shes never done a thing wrong pennys different she can be very difficult at times youll find that out if you marry her but gillians never been any trouble at all when ashton said this i understood the pain parents feel when their children are sick or when they get hurt in an accident then ashton asked me if id thought any more about asking penny to marry me immediately and go to australia i told him i hadnt changed my mind that it was the wrong moment to present penny with new problems i suppose youre right he said in a disappointed voice are you staying to dinner malcolm with you permission i replied politely im taking penelope to the hospital afterwards he nodded dont tell her about gillians eyes promise me that i already have he didnt answer that but turned on his heel and walked away towards the house i felt very sorry for him whatever the information about him in the computer i could see in his eyes the deep pain that he was suffering penny and i went to the hospital and i waited for an hour while she talked to gillian then we went to meet inspector honnister and i introduced him to penny thank you for coming miss ashton he said we re doing the best we can in this case but we need information and we havent got any i understand she replied ive got some news for you but i dont know how much it will help you well miss ashton lets hear what youve got said honnister gently gillian says it was a man ah said honnister with satisfaction a little more than half the population of britain had just been dropped from his list of possible suspects what sort of man young old anything you can tell me will be of value he led penelope through gillians story several times and each time managed to get a little more helpful information gillian had walked back from church and had seen a car parked near the entrance to the drive leading to the house someone was bending over the car looking at the engine she thought the car had broken down and went over to offer to help as she came up to him the man turned and smiled at her she had never seen him before she was just about to speak to him when he threw the acid into her face i le didnt speak at all but she could remember that he was about forty with pale skin she couldnt really say anything more about him after honnister had left us penny and i talked a bit more about what we had learned then we fell silent what are you thinking about asked penny after a few minutes automatically i said what was in my mind im thinking it would be a good idea if we got married malcolm she said with surprise shock pleasure and sadness all mixed up in that one word dont you think its a good idea i said and watched her try to find words to reply but dont say this is so sudden but thats exactly what it is so sudden she said and here of all places does the place matter i dont suppose it does she said quietly but the time does why now i suppose i could have picked a better time i agreed but the question just jumped out of my mouth you asked me what i was thinking about actually im not the only one who thinks its a good idea your father does too he wanted me to ask you last night so you two have been discussing me behind my back i dont know that i like that dont get angry its traditional and polite for a man to talk about his plans with his probable future fatherin law what would you have done if he had been against it asked penelope id have asked you just the same im marrying you not your father youre not marrying anyone yet she laid her hand on mine you idiot i was beginning to think youd never ask i was going to but other things got in the way i know she said sadly ive been so unhappy today thinking about gillian and seeing her in so much pain and daddy he doesnt say much but i think hes going through hell and now you come and give me more problems im sorry penny perhaps i should take the question back forget about it for now no she said you cant ask a question she was silent for a while and at last she said i will marry you malcolm id marry you tomorrow but that cant be i dont know when it will be weve got to get this business with gillian sorted out first can you wait of course i replied happily as we drove to her home my heart was like a singing bird and i realized the truth in all that the poets say about love i think we should tell your father he seems to be worried about you i suggested just before penny went in ill tell him now she said as she gave me a goodnight kiss chapter five ashton disappears ogilvie wanted me to protect ashton and his family so early next morning i was in the office making my plans i went to ogilvie and told him that the first thing i needed was a list of all the people ashton was in contact with ogilvie smiled and pushed some papers across the desk its all there ready for you in return i gave him my list thats what i need i said he looked carefully at what i had written whats this six men six cars radio telephones he stopped who do you think we are the cia why do you need all these i have to watch three perhaps four people twentyfour hours a day he stopped me which three or four people first ashton and penny ashton then gillian ashton and benson why benson ogilvie demanded well the computer has them all even benson kept under top secret i put all the names through the computer until i lost them in level purple ok but you cant keep an eye on four people with six men ill let you have eight and ill arrange for ashtons telephones to be tapped he looked at the list again but what the devil do you need a gun for is it really essential well bensons carrying a gun in his pocket and ashtons got another under his arm if theyre expecting that kind of action then we should be prepared right i give you permission to take two guns get your men together and i want a taperecording of what you say to them i called together all the men i wanted for my team and told them what they had to do larry who shared my office was one of them it was going to be his first job in the field away from the office i took the taperecording back to ogilvie ive got another question he said did you cancel a request made to inspector honnister for copies of his reports on the ashton case yes it seemed to me a waste of time especially if im going to be there watching ashton honnister wasnt very happy about it and i think its important to keep him happy we want him to cooperate with us youre perfectly right of course said ogilvie except for one thing this department did not request those copies the request came from another department and theyre not very pleased that their request has been cancelled oh i said who wanted the reports do you need to ask said ogilvie sharply the gentleman you met yesterday is making sure he knows everything that happens all right malcolm go and look after ashton but dont do anything without talking to me about it first is that agreed yes ill do that sir and i left his office driving back to marlow i explained to larry godwin more about what had happened i told him that information about ashton was locked up in level purple in the computer and that i didnt have permission to see it larry was both angry and amazed its so stupid he interrupted you mean ogilvie wont tell you what this business is all about i dont think hes allowed to tell me anything there was a top man from the government in his office when he spoke to me obviously a man with a lot of power you mean cregar he said i glanced quickly at him who lord cregar short fat man i saw him coming out of ogilvies office when you were there yesterday he got divorced last week his picture was in the newspaper do you know anything more about him i asked not a thing and he left me even more puzzled than before when we arrived at the hospital we met inspector honnister in the car park he looked a bit more cheerful than the day before were making progress i think we know the make of the car a witness saw a dark blue ford cortina parked near ashtons house on saturday afternoon im beginning to think we might find this man i hope gillian ashton will be able to identify him when we get him she wont i replied shaking my head shes blind honnister looked horrified and swore violently wait till i catch this man itll be a real pleasure to send him to prison for a long long time while we were talking jack brent one of the other members of my team came across penny ashtons inside the hospital visiting gillian he said but theres something else you ought to know he went on we cant find ashton isnt he at his office i asked sharply no and he isnt at home theres no sign of benson either come on larry quick were going to ashtons house there may be nothing to worry about but lets make sure jack stay close to penny ashton for gods sake dont lose her at ashtons house we found only one of the servants mary she told us that ashtons bed had not been slept in the previous night and she hadnt seen him at all that day i began to get worried and rang the hospital to speak to penny did you tell your father about us last night no hed gone to bed when i got in and hed gone out when i got up this morning why whats the matter malcolm has something happened to him i dont know if anythings happened but i think youd better come home now im coming at once she replied and put the phone down i walked into ashtons study on his desk were two envelopes one addressed to penny and the other to me i picked up mine and opened it my dear malcolm you are too intelligent not to have understood what i have tried to say to you in our recent conversations there is an old french saying the man who finds a good soninlaw gains a son but the man who finds a bad one loses a daughter marry penny and make her happy but for her sake be a bad soninlaw yours george ashton i sat down with a heavy feeling in my stomach and the knowledge that we had made a bad job of looking after ashton chapter six a bad soninlaw i rang ogilvie and told him that ashton and benson had disappeared and i read him ashtons letter a bad soninlaw said ogilvie what the hell does he mean i think hes saying that hes getting away from penny in order to protect her i said i wouldnt do what he wanted marry her at once and take her away from him so hes taken himself away from her he must think shes in danger if shes with him i suppose you could be right but it seems a bloody strange way to protect his daughter does she know asked ogilvie not yet shes on her way back from the hospital now ashtons left a note for her too if theres anything important in it ill let you know think shell tell you he asked yes the funny thing is sir that last night i did ask her to marry me and she accepted she was going to tell ashton when she got home but hed already gone to bed maybe hed already left if hed only waited another couple of hours he might have decided not to go well dont blame yourself for that there was a pause does penelope know about your work for the department no i replied well she has to know and nows the time to tell her what i want you to do is to search the house very carefully see it you can find anything that might show where ashton has gone if theres anything you dont understand bring it back to the office i think theres going to be a lot of trouble over this i didnt look forward to explaining to penny about my work and why we wanted to search her fathers house i had a feeling that our relationship was about to change for the worse just then i heard pennys astonmartin sports car coming up the drive to the house i met her as she ran to the door jack brents car was now coming up the drive theres a man following me penny cried and then she noticed larry godwin in the hall whats happening malcolm who are these men whats happened to daddy as far as i know hes all right i said and took her into her fathers study i picked up the letter youd better read this as she read the note her face turned pale but i dont i dont understand what does he say she gave me the letter and went over to the window while i read my dearest penny for reasons which i cannot explain i must go away for a while i am not a criminal and i have done nothing wrong i do not know how long i shall be away but please do not try to find me and do not bring the police into this my reasons are private i shall be quite safe because my old friend benson will be looking after me it would make me very happy if you would marry malcolm as soon as possible i know that you love him and i think he is a very good man i am sure that the two of you will be very happy together and i am equally sure that you will both look after gillian please forgive me for my sudden departure but it is in the best interests of all of us your loving father george i looked up im sorry penny but i dont understand she cried oh malcolm whats happened to him she came into my arms and i held her close i dont know i said but well find out she was still for a while but pushed me away as two cars arrived quickly malcolm who are all these men have you told the police daddy said not to no i havent told the police i said quietly sit down penny i have a lot to tell you i hesitated not knowing best where to begin i told you i work for a company called mcculloch and ross and thats perfectly true we do the work i told you about and we do it very well but the company is also a sort of secret government department which deals with economic and industrial information if it is important to the state you mean youre some kind of spy no not a spy but you were watching my father like a common spy she said angrily and was i just a means to an end did you get close to me just to learn more about my father no i looked her straight in the eyes i didnt know anything at all about your father until yesterday and i dont know much more now she looked at me coldly and these men in the hall are they from your department too yes then id like to talk to the man in charge i knew something was worrying daddy now i know where it was coming from youre talking to the man in charge and youre wrong about your father i said carefully that stopped her and she sat down suddenly you are in charge thats right and you dont know what you are doing she said with a laugh of disbelief i know what im doing but i dont know why its become very complicated let me tell you how i got into this so i told her everything i told her about nellie the computer and the secret colour levels i told her about ogilvie and cregar i told her much more than i should have told her i told her how after the acid attack on gillian i was told to watch and protect her father ive not done a very good job so far i said bur ill find him youre not going after him he said in his letter i interrupted her all i know is that your father is considered by some people to be a very important man i dont know why but he could be going into danger without realizing it my job is still to find him and protect him hes not in a position to do that properly himself she started to cry quietly at first and the tears ran down her face then she began to tremble as if she was suddenly very cold and i put my arm around her she held on to me tightly when your safe comfortable world seems to be falling apart you need to hold on to somebody oh malcolm what am i to do you must do what you think best if you trust me youll help me to find him but i couldnt blame you if you refuse i havent been open and honest with you i should have told you all this yesterday but you couldnt you werent allowed to malcolm what are your men waiting for for your decision i want to search the house and i cant do that without your permission she came back to the desk and read her fathers letter again he wrote to me too i said and gave her my letter she read it slowly then gave it back to me bring in your men she said in a voice which had no expression or feeling in it we found a number of surprising things in that house but none of them seemed to be of any use to us there was no clue to tell us where ashton could have gone in the cellar there was a very wellequipped laboratory but none of us had any idea what sort of work ashton had done there hidden behind a cupboard in ashtons bedroom was a heavy steel door with the sort of lock you usually see only in banks by measuring the walls outside and inside the house we discovered that there was a small secret strongroom there so secret that not even penny knew about it while the other men were searching the house penny and i talked about her fathers life i asked her how long benson had worked for the family hes been with us since before i was born she replied he used to work in one of daddys factories but he visited us at least once a week then when we came to live in this big house he came to live here and work as daddys personal servant we were still talking when peter michaelis one of my searchers came in to report that they had found nothing useful but that in a room upstairs there was the biggest model railway he had ever seen i didnt believe him and forgot all about it because ogilvie rang to tell me to come back to the office as quickly as possible i explained about the secret strongroom and the laboratory and he promised to send some experts immediately to examine everything before i left i looked for michaelis and found him with the model railway you havent time to play with that i said angrily were here on business to find out about ashton michaelis smiled this is business to search this place thoroughly well have to look inside every piece of this railway set the whole thing is so big that we have to use the controls to bring everything back to this central point i looked at the railway more carefully it was very big and very complicated all controlled from a central desk there must have been about two kilometres of railway line but michaelis seemed to know how to work the controls so i left him to search the thousand different pieces of equipment and went downstairs penny was waiting for me her eyes flashing with anger someone has been searching my room i know i replied all the rooms in the house have been searched i think you could have trusted me she said icily its not a question of trust i tried to explain i do my job in the way i was taught i have to go by the book then its not the kind of book id want to read she exploded and we had our first big quarrel chapter seven ashton and the russian scientist i was not in the best of tempers when i met ogilvie back in the office an hour later all i could tell him was that ashton had obviously been prepared for escape for a long time he had been frightened of something and had made his plans carefully ready to be put into operation at any moment ogilvie had another problem i had a meeting this afternoon with the minister and people from other departments it wasnt easy there are other people who dont want our department to be in charge of ashtons case lord cregar for example i asked how did you recognize him he gets his photograph in the papers i replied well his interest in ashton goes back a longtime before this department started ashton was dealt with by cregars department cregar badly wants to take ashtons case away from us however today the minister decided that ashton was still our case and so its still our job to find him that means its your job malcolm i need permission to see level purple in the computer not possible dont be stupid i replied angrily how can i look for a man if i dont know anything about him either i get to see level purple tomorrow or i resign youre always in too much of a hurry malcolm to begin with i couldnt get permission for you to see level purple by tomorrow and in any case ashton isnt in level purple hes in level black and you couldnt get permission to see level black in less than three months thats it then i said id better go along to my office and type my resignation dont be a young fool ogilvie said sharply he thought for a long minute drumming his fingers on the desk suddenly he said ive made up my mind but if anyone ever knows of this i could lose my job wait here he went through a door at the back of his office was away for several minutes and then returned come in here i followed him into a small room where there was a computer screen ive opened level black for you he said you must read about ashton and only ashton there are other things in level black which are better for you not to know you have my word he nodded and left closing the door behind him i looked at the computer screen on it was a message no written notes to be made of anything in level black i sighed and started to read about george ashtons life which had been a very full one aleksandr chelyuskin was born near novgorod in russia in at the age of twelve he was such a good student that he was sent to a special school in moscow where he made excellent progress especially in mathematics in he came under the influence of peter kapitza a brilliant russian physicist who had studied for some years in england kapitza changed the direction of chelyuskins studies from mathematics to physics and chelyuskin later played an important part in improving the quality of russian weapons in the war of in march when the russians discovered that the americans had developed the atomic bomb chelyuskin was told to work on the development of a similar bomb for russia after the war finished in chelyuskin became dissatisfied because he had to go on working on research into weapons and he did not like what he was doing he began to think about people not physics and mathematics he decided that he did not like russian society and the direction which russia was following after the war he decided to kill himself but without actually dying he made a careful and complicated plan and three months later it was reported that he had died in a fire the burnt body of a man was certainly found after the fire but it was not chelyuskins so at the age of twentyeight chelyuskin arrived secretly in england unfortunately for the english who had hoped to learn about russian secrets from him chelyuskin refused to talk about his work on atomic weapons he did not want to work as a scientist for the british government what he wanted to do was to live in england as an ordinary citizen the government officials and scientists who had been looking forward to his ideas could not understand him but finally he got what he had asked for he did almost exactly the same as he had done in russia he took another mans identity this time an english soldier who had died in a traffic accident chelyuskin was taught to speak english and when he finally took the place of the george ashton who had died he was able to live successfully as a member of english society it was a strange new world for george ashton at first he took a job in a shop but this quickly bored him he had been given some money to help him in his new life and soon he started a business with a man whom he met at work john franklin was good at working with his hands george ashton was good at using his brains and their business did well ashton married franklins daughter mary and they had two daughters penelope and gillian two years later mary franklin died and ashton looked after the two girls at the same time he worked hard to develop new chemical materials for industry which gradually made him very rich all this time people from the british secret service were watching carefully to see if the man from russia would do something extraordinary with his brilliant scientific mind but ashton concentrated on his business and gradually the officials from the government lost interest in what he was doing ashton became more and more successful in industry but no one paid much attention until i had sounded the alarm by my careless questions to the computer until then the life of george ashton previously aleksandr chelyuskin my future fatherinlaw had run very smoothly in england when i finished i had been sitting in front of the computer screen for two and a half hours and i had a headache i went back to ogilvies office where he offered me a glass of whisky and we sat down to talk about what i had seen what do you think he began i think george ashton is one hell of a man im proud to have known him i replied anything else yes i said one fact theres been a big change in the kind of scientific work ashton has done in england its all technical hes been applying his own earlier ideas to developing new materials but that isnt the type of person he was before he was a man who thought up new ideas everything he did all of his training was in that direction did he just give it up when he came to england or has he been applying his mind to something that we dont know anything about youre not too stupid said ogilvie youre probably right you cant stop a man thinking but how can you find out what hes been thinking about do we know what books he buys what scientific magazines he reads i asked yes he keeps up to date only in the type of chemistry that is important to his business nothing else we sat for a few minutes in silence and then i asked what does cregar have to do with ashton it was his department that helped ashton escape from russia after the war cregar himself went into russia to bring him out cregar wasnt lord cregar then his name was pallton now hes head of his department when ashton became an ordinary businessman instead of a scientist with lots of valuable secrets his records were moved to our department and cregar was very annoyed he always thought that ashton might do something scientifically useful one day although cregar brought ashton out of russia ashton never really liked him and certainly didnt trust him thats probably why cregars interfering now hes sure that ashton has useful ideas that hes hiding from everybody is there any news of ashton i asked none at all weve got people watching the airports and the ports all the usual things replied ogilvie we must find him and i want to find the man who threw the acid into gillian ashtons face and frightened ashton so much that he ran away to protect his children from any more attacks the next day brought little progress penny wouldnt speak to me after our quarrel about the search of her room and nobody had seen ashton or benson at any of the airports or seaports at three oclock ogilvie rang me to say that they expected to unlock the strongroom at ashtons house later that afternoon i want you to be there listen carefully when the door is finally opened only you and the man working on the lock will be present as soon as the door is opened you send him out of the room and check what is inside the strongroom if the contents can be moved you bring them here if they cant be moved you close and lock the door again no one else must see what is in that room is that clear perfectly clear i replied when i arrived at the ashtons house once again i met lord cregar in the hall he did not look pleased to see me ah mr jaggard i understand there is a strongroom here has it been opened yet i wondered where he got his information but answered no not yet good then i am in time said lord cregar i said am i to understand that you wish to be present when the room is opened thats correct he replied im afraid that will not be possible he looked at me thoughtfully do you know who i am yes my lord i have instructions that nobody except myself is to be present when the door is opened his eyes opened wide with surprise and anger did ogilvie say that those were his instructions to me i dont know if he was thinking of you my lord do you wish to speak to him there is a telephone in the study yes he replied id better speak to ogilvie myself he went off to the study and i went over to the window and looked out at the garden a few minutes later cregar came out of the study looking very angry he left the house got into his car and drove quickly away the phone rang it was ogilvie cregar must not be allowed into that strongroom and he mustnt know what is inside he wont i replied hes gone were just about to open the door let me know what you find he said i went up to ashtons bedroom there you are said the man who was working on the door you can open it now ill have to ask you to leave now frank i told him he went out and closed the bedroom door behind him i opened the door to the strongroom ogilvies mouth fell open empty absolutely i replied there wasnt a thing in that room it looks as though its never been used since it was first built who else knows about this he asked no one only you and i thats a pity cregar will never believe me when i tell him perhaps i should have let him stay with you i didnt care what cregar believed or did not believe but ogilvie warned me to be careful cregar is a bad man to have as an enemy he didnt like the way you treated him today he didnt show it he seemed pleasant enough i replied thats his way said ogilvie always polite and pleasant but dont trust him chapter eight the man who threw the acid after that nothing happened for a while the search for ashton and benson continued but with no success the day after we opened the strongroom i rang penny is this to tell me youve found daddy she asked no ive got no news about him im sorry then i dont think weve much to talk about malcolm she said and rang off gillian was still in hospital and i went to visit her the doctor said there was a chance that she might recover some of the sight of her left eye but she would never see with her right eye again when i talked with gillian she wanted to know what had gone wrong between penny and me nothing i said lightly did she say there was anything wrong no but she stopped talking about you and when i asked she said she hadnt seen you weve both been very busy i said i changed the subject and we talked about other things afterwards i spoke to peter michaelis who was the member of my team with the job of protecting her he found the job boring but told me he tried to help gillian by reading to her every afternoon he was a kind man and he and gillian had become quite friendly when we talked about ashton michaelis said that the most interesting thing he had seen in the house had been the model railway by far the largest he had ever seen hes got copies of all the old railway timetables and the system runs to time it is very complicated so hes got a computer and hes managed to program the whole timetable on it its wonderful the whole thing works automatically that sounded like ashton find the most efficient way to do something however his railway system was not helping me to find him so i left michaelis and went back to london two weeks after ashton had disappeared honnister rang me weve got a suspect a man in london he hired a car for the weekend when miss ashton was attacked the owner of the carhire firm told one of our men that acid had been spilt on the back seat whats the mans name has he said anything yet i demanded his names mayberry one of the men from scotland yard is going to see him this evening hes an inspector crammond ill ring him at once i want to be there to make sure they arent too bloody soft with him i met crammond that evening and we went to finsbury in north london where mayberry lived in a small flat he doesnt sound like a violent man said crammond the woman who owns the house describes him as very quiet always reading and he goes to church twice on sundays i felt disappointed this sounded less and less like our man we went up to the hat and knocked on the door a man in his forties with a pale unhealthy skin opened the door mr peter mayberry said crammond yes came the reply we are police officers said crammond pleasantly we think you can help us can we come in i suppose so how can i help you he asked coldly it wasnt a very luxurious flat the furniture was either old or cheap but it was clean and tidy on one wall there was a shelf with forty or fifty books on it i looked at them some were about religion some were about the protection of the world from scientific progress others were ordinary stories crammond started by asking to see mayberrys driving licence i dont have a car replied mayberry that wasnt what i asked said crammond can i see your licence please mayberry took his licence out of his jacket pocket and handed it over crammond examined it carefully and passed it to me when did you last drive a car mr mayberry asked crammond mayberry said look if anyone says ive been in an accident theyre wrong because i havent he seemed nervous do you ever hire a car continued crammond i have done recently no not for some months replied mayberry supposing i said that you hired a car in slough two weekends ago what would you say asked crammond id say you were wrong replied vlayberry quietly where were you that weekend here as usual you can ask mrs jackson downstairs crammond looked at him for a moment mrs jackson was away that weekend did anyone see you did you go to church no i didnt feel well crammond spoke more strongly mr mayberry i suggest that you are telling me lies i think that on saturday morning you went to slough by train and you hired a ford cortina car from joliffes garage mr joliffe was very angry about the acid damage to the back seat of the car where did you buy the acid i bought no acid said mayberry but you hired the car you gave your name and address to mr joliffe no repeated mayberry well said inspector crammond we can easily check that we have the fingerprints from the car im sure you wont mind coming to the police station so that we can compare yours with those from the car this was the first i had heard of fingerprints and i was not sure that crammond really had any but it worried mayberry i dont have to give you my fingerprints i want you to leave or ill send for the police said crammond when did you first meet miss ashton he went on suddenly ive never met her said mayberry quickly too quickly but you know of her insisted crammond mayberry was very nervous now he took a step backwards and bumped into the table knocking a book onto the floor i picked it up and looked at the front a report on developments in genetics suddenly a number of puzzling facts began to make sense to me mayberrys basic religious ideas his interest in protecting the world from modern science and what i knew about the work penny ashton was doing i said mr mayberry what do you think of what is happening in modern biological science crammond looked very surprised mayberry turned to look at me its bad he said very bad in what way i asked the biologists are breaking the laws of god cried mayberry they are creating new forms of life life that is not in the bible life that was not made by god mayberry was becoming more and more excited now shes godless shes destroying the work of god and making monsters i had difficulty in keeping my voice calm i suppose that by she you mean dr penelope ashton crammond looked very puzzled by now the change of direction in the conversation had left him behind mayberry now in a state of extreme nervous excitement said thoughtlessly among others such as professor lumsden i replied hes her boss her devil if you thought she was doing wrong why didnt you talk to her about it perhaps you could have made her change her mind see things your way i asked she would never have listened to me and i wouldnt want to talk to her said mayberry crammond realized what was happening mr mayberry he said are you admitting that you threw acid into the face of a woman called ashton mayberry had a hunted look on his face now as he realized that he had said too much i havent said that youve said enough crammond turned to me i think we have enough information now to take him to the police station i nodded then said to mayberry youre a religious man you go to church every sunday twice im told do you think it was a good action to throw acid into the face of a young woman i am not responsible to you for my actions said mayberry i am responsible only to god and may god help you i said because you got the wrong girl you threw the acid in the face of dr ashtons sister who was coming home from church mayberry stared at me the confident expression on his face now changed to an expression of absolute horror he whispered the wrong wrong suddenly a kind of horror overcame him his whole body shook and he screamed at the top of his voice before falling heavily to the floor unconscious oh damn said crammond as the policeman waiting outside burst into the room hell never go to prison now mayberry was now lying on the floor crying and making noises which neither crammond nor i could understand hes mad phone lor an ambulance said crammond well not get any more sensible answers out of him chapter nine lord cregar again next morning i told ogilvie about mayberry he found it difficult to believe and asked lots of questions did he throw the acid just because he thought she was doing something wrong are you sure could someone else have told him to do it why did he choose dr ashton ogilvies questions came like bullets from a gun we cant be absolutely sure i replied the man s completely mad now and i dont think well ever learn much more from him damn it malcolm the whole thing doesnt make sense this bloody fool chose a scientist by chance and then threw the acid in the face of the wrong girl why did ashton run away i had no answer to that we seemed to have made no progress at all in the search for george ashton i went along to the university to tell penny she was with lumsden her boss but took me to her own office her manner to me was cool what do you want here malcolm she said have you found daddy i shook my head weve found the man who threw the acid i said oh she sat down at her desk who is he a man called peter mayberry he works in an office in london hes also a very religious man she frowned then said but whatever could he have to do with gillian i sat down im sorry penny i didnt want to tell you this but you have to know the acid wasnt intended for gillian it was intended for you for me she shook her head as if she couldnt believe what i had said why on earth should a man like that want to attack me why me he seemed to think that you were interfering with the laws of god suddenly she realized the full meaning of what i had said oh my god she cried poor gillian her body began to shake and her head fell forward across her desk she began to cry loudly i got her a glass of water but there wasnt much i could do until she had got over the first shock i put my arm round her and said here drink this she raised her head and cried oh gillian shed be all right if i if i hadnt oh malcolm what am i to do do theres nothing you can do you carry on as usual i said firmly i dont see how i can do that not after this i spoke carefully you cant blame yourself for what happened you mustnt think that youre responsible for the actions of someone whos crazy oh i wish it had been me she cried no you mustnt ever say or think that now youve got to think clearly because i need your help i need to ask you and your boss some questions she nodded sadly and went to wash her face while i called professor lumsden when he came in he looked at pennys white face and red eyes whats happened here and who are you he asked in a shocked voice im malcolm jaggard and im a sort of police officer im also engaged to penny were going to be married lumsden looked very surprised oh i didnt know about that you know of course about the recent attack on pennys sister yes a most terrible thing i told him about mayberry and a worried look came over his face this is bad he said im deeply sorry penny can you tell me something about your work here professor i said in a way this crazy man is right he said weve discovered ways of isolating some of the thousands of genes in the seeds of plants and animals then we try to transfer them it can be very dangerous but if it works it will help to produce more and better food in the world but we are very very careful its terribly important that these new bacteria cant escape from the laboratory until we are absolutely sure theyre safe some people think were doing wrong because its dangerous others like your mayberry have religious reasons for wanting to stop us i could see that professor lumsden had nothing to tell me that would help me find george ashton penny was still very shocked and upset so i drove her home weeks and then months went by the police and my department looked very carefully into mayberrys life and decided that he really was mad it had been his own idea to throw the acid and no one else had sent him his attack had absolutely no connection with george ashton which left us with a big problem why had ashton run away it didnt make sense my relationship with penny improved although neither of us referred to marriage gillians condition improved a little and the doctors managed to save about a quarter of her eyesight she was able to leave hospital and live at home she and penny began to make plans to go to the united states where the doctors would try to repair the damage to her face one evening when penny and i were having dinner she said do you remember you once talked about someone called lord cregar yes thats right why hes been seeing my boss professor lumsden that caught my interest was it anything to do with mayberry i asked no i replied penny the first time he came was just after you opened the strongroom in our house something seemed wrong to me why had cregar been seeing lumsden before we knew about mayberry was there a connection between ashton and lumsden that we had missed chapter ten tragedy in sweden ogilvie sent for me next morning and showed me a photograph of a man wearing a heavy coat and a fur hat there was a lot of snow in the picture have you seen that man before he asked yes thats george ashton i replied no it isnt he said that mans name is fyodr koslov and he lives in stockholm at least thats what his passport says he passed another photograph across the desk i took one look at it and said thats benson are you quite sure these photographs came from our man in sweden we didnt have any good recent photos of ashton and benson so youre the only person who can really identify them im quite sure those are photographs of ashton and benson what do you want me to do now i replied i want you to go to stockholm first of all talk to our man there a man called henty and then do i contact ashton tell him about mayberry tell him its safe to come back to england no it might frighten him it he knows that we are still watching him even after thirty years just watch him and find out what the hell hes doing in stockholm ogilvie didnt know it but he had just made the worst mistake of his career it was dark and cold in stockholm at that time of year and it never stopped snowing i felt very cold and wondered why ashton had decided to come to such a place henty the man who had taken the photographs of ashton and benson was our only man in stockholm and it was impossible for him to keep an eye on both ot them for twentyfour hours a day i had to go to the british embassy to ask for assistance the man i saw was called cutler he did not like me mr jaggard he said we havent got men free to do casual police work why is this man ashton so important ive never heard of him im not allowed to tell you anything more about him hes too important he didnt like that and refused to give me any more men to watch ashton so i telephoned ogilvie in london and told him about the difficulties that cutler was making for me an hour later cutler suddenly appeared at my hotel and arranged for several men to help me we watched ashton and benson very carefully and they did nothing unusual ashton visited museums went to the theatre and to the cinema and he spent a lot of time in bookshops the only strange thing about them was that they did nothing strange it was as if they were on holiday i began to wonder if ashton was having his first ever holiday from the problems of his business life in england four weeks went by like this a boring time for all of us and cutler began to complain that his men were wasting their time one day however henty came to see me with news that worried me he had discovered that we were not the only people who were watching ashton there was a team of other watchers who also followed ashton everywhere he went the next morning henty and i followed one of them when his duty period was finished we were horrified to find that the man went back to the russian embassy i rang ogilvie to tell him what we had discovered he too was horrified and caught the next plane to sweden we sat down to talk about this new situation look he said maybe we are making too much out of all this for thirty years ashton has run his business quietly in england he hasnt given us any of the wonderful scientific ideas we hoped for if he wants to leave england maybe even go back to russia why should we stop him why not let him do what he wants why not i agreed i cant say i understand whats been happening and im beginning to feel that we shouldnt really be involved in this on the other hand continued ogilvie there are two things that puzzle me and worry me why did he run away and why did he build that strongroom and then not use it why was it empty malcolm why had it never been used ive spent a lot of time asking myself the same questions i still dont know the answers i replied thats what worries me ashton is a very clever man hes very good at making people look and think in the wrong direction thats how he was able to leave russia in the first place maybe hes pointing us in the wrong direction hes trying to make us believe that he has no secrets that could mean that there is something hidden something that could be very important then why the hell did he build the strongroom in the first place i said confused to deceive us so that whoever found the strongroom would think they were wasting their time fie wanted us to think that because the secret room was empty there was no secret information to hide but you think there may be something secret some scientific discovery bidden in another place maybe even probably but i dont know for sure said ogilvie in any case i cant take the risk of leaving george ashton for the russians i dont know why theyre following him but if they ever find out that hes really chelyuskin theyll be very interested and theyll want him back like us theyll want to know what scientific ideas hes been having in the last thirty years i cant afford that risk so weve got to take ashton back to england whether he likes it or not i could go and tell him the russians are following him i suggested hed come with us willingly then i dont know replied ogilvie if he thought the british secret service was still following him after thirty years he might get so angry that hed go back to russia willingly no thats not good enough its too risky but if he finds out that the russians are watching him hell probably go straight back to england i said provided that he doesnt know about growled ogilvie suspiciously how do you plan to arrange it ask the russians to wear flags in their hats wait a minute i said ive got an idea i turned to larry godwin who had come to stockholm with ogilvie how well do you speak russian larry that depends on what kind of regional accent you want he replied why ogilvie began to understand i see he said thoughtfully the russians are very careful when they watch ashton too careful to make mistakes but we could make a mistake for them and frighten ashton away from them i like the idea we considered our plan carefully and three days later we put it into operation the situation outside ashtons flat was becoming crazy two men from the british embassy were looking in shop windows waiting for ashton or benson to come out they did not know that they were being watched by two russian agents looking in other shop windows and the two russians were being watched by two men from our department there was hardly any room left for tourists in that narrow street at halfpast ten that morning ashton came out and walked towards the centre of the city larry godwin and everybody else followed him ashton went into a bookshop and as he was looking at a book larry who had gone in behind him dropped a book and swore loudly in russian ashton put his book back on the shelf and left the shop immediately he walked around the streets for quite a long time looking behind him frequently and then went to have lunch in a restaurant larry followed him into the restaurant and sat down at a table near ashton when larry ordered his meal he spoke swedish with a strong russian accent ashton looked very worried and finished his meal rather quickly larry came out of the restaurant close behind ashton and followed him back to ashtons flat making sure that ashton could see that he was being followed after ashton had returned to his flat we had a long wait in the cold we all had little radiotelephones and at ten to nine in the evening i received the message we had been waiting for ashton and benson have left the flat theyre carrying bags and walking towards the taxis at the end of the street benson took a taxi to the railway station but ashton went off in the opposite direction at the station benson bought two tickets for goteborg in the west of sweden there was half an hour before the train left but ashton did not appear and when the train went only benson was on it together with several of my men ashton had disappeared again i decided to follow the train by car if benson had bought two tickets maybe ashton intended to join him at the next station i sent two men to the first station where bensons train would stop and larry and i drove to the next station eskilstuna on the way we heard on the radiophone that ashton had in fact got on the train at the first stop i relaxed again weve got them now i told larry but when we arrived at the railway station at eskilstuna we learnt that ashton and benson had jumped from the train when it stopped near a small country village i looked at the map the nearest town was called strangnas and we arrived there about an hour later it was a small town with only one hotel henty knew it quite well because it was also an army training centre which he had visited officially he went into the hotel and found that ashton and benson were definitely there probably fast asleep in their rooms we booked into the hotel too and i made my plans for the next morning i wanted michaelis brent and henty to be early for breakfast i would be sitting in a car outside the hotel brent would have a secret radiomicrophone and would talk quietly into it so that he could tell me what was happening halfway through breakfast larry was to go in and make ashton think that the russians had succeeded in following him even to strangniis the next morning i waited in the car i hated what i was doing i wanted to go and talk to ashton to tell him everything that had happened and convince him that he had run away from england for the wrong reasons i wanted to explain to him that the acid attack on gillian had been a mistake made by a madman and that it had nothing at all to do with him i wanted to persuade him that it was completely safe to go back to england and take up his normal family and business life again but ogilvie did not want that he did not want ashton to know that he was still being watched by the british secret service and i had to do what ogilvie said even if i disagreed with him at the same time i liked george ashton he was pennys father and i hated myself for what i had to do michaelis brent and henty went to have breakfast in the hotel at halfpast seven a quarter of an hour later ashton and benson came into the restaurant and sat down for breakfast five minutes later larry godwin arrived and spoke to the waitress in swedish with a very strong russian accent ashton noticed him and went very very pale as larry followed the waitress to the table he greeted ashton in a friendly manner but in russian and ashton knocked over his cup i listened to brents description of what was happening and i felt sick at what we were doing to george ashton ashton and benson left the restaurant and a few minutes later they were outside the hotel larry followed them and did not try to hide ashton did not seem to know what to do and on the radio i told larry to ask ashton to go with him at first it seemed that ashton was going to do this but benson shook his head and tried to get ashton away finally they started to walk out of town towards the forest over the radio came larrys voice i talked to ashton and he was ready to come with me but benson spoiled it he didnt want to listen to what i had to say what are they doing now i asked theyve just left the road and walked into the forest we all followed them into the trees they kept changing direction to try to get away from us and twice we nearly lost them after we had gone about three kilometres into the forest i heard the sharp sound of guns from where i was standing i could not see ashton but henty was further ahead over the radio he said its the swedish army this is a training area and ashton is walking straight towards the guns hell get himself killed i started running as fast as i could i had to stop george ashton and i did not care what ogilvie said i ran on until i thought my chest would hurts i shouted ashton george ashton stop he stopped and turned round and his eyes grew wide with surprise i had almost reached him when there was a single shot and ashton fell i heard henty run past me as i bent over ashton there was blood coming from the corner of his mouth malcolm what take it easy george i said holding him up in my arms he pulled his hand from his pocket with a piece of paper the the then he fell hack his eyes still open looking at the sky george ashton was dead i knelt there in the snow thinking how badly i had done my job i cursed ogilvie and wished i had done what my own mind had told me was right but it was too late i had never felt so bad in all my life henty came back with a gun in his hand i got him he said got who for gods sake benson i stared at him you shot benson he looked at me in surprise well he shot ashton didnt he i saw him do it maybe you couldnt see him but i did this was almost too much for me benson shot ashton yes he tried to shoot me too said henty and if anyone shoots at me i shoot back i was still trying to take this in when there was a loud noise at the top of the hill above us and a huge army vehicle appeared it stopped in front of us and a swedish officer climbed out henty threw his gun on the ground as i looked at the piece of paper that ashton had tried to give me it was a railway timetable for trains from stockholm to goteborg the swedish police were not happy they had two dead bodies and four live men in the middle of an army training area they took us to an army centre where we were kept for the next three weeks i had no idea what was happening back in london but suddenly early one morning i was told to get dressed and was taken to stockholm airport the officer who had come with me said there is your plane mr jaggard you are no longer welcome in sweden i arrived at heathrow airport in london and was met by ogilvie he took me to my flat and told me to report to his office the next morning as i got out of the car i asked him about penny he told me that she was away in scotland does she know i asked yes ogilvie said quietly he put a piece of paper in my hand and said you ought to read this then he drove away the piece of paper contained a short article from a newspaper which described how two englishmen george ashton and howard benson had died in an unfortunate accident in sweden they had walked into an army training area by mistake and been killed in the gunfire chapter eleven more mysteries and new dangers in ogilvies office the next morning i had to go over everything that had happened from my arrival in stockholm until ashtons death ogilvie wanted to be sure of every detail the mystery was benson why had he shot ashton he had worked for ashton for more than twenty years what possible reason could there be for killing him so suddenly ogilvie had studied every known fact of bensons life and had found nothing wrong nothing strange nothing even slightly suspicious ogilvie told me i had to attend a meeting with people from other departments the next day he reminded me that officially i did not know of ashtons background as chelyuskin because that was in level black of the computer which i was not supposed to have read the meeting on the next day was difficult all the people there seemed to be the heads of other departments which had been embarrassed by what had happened in sweden the most difficult questions came from lord cregar is it correct that mr ogilvie told you not to let ashton know who you were yes thats correct i replied but we have just been told that you showed yourself to him deliberately it was only when he saw you that he turned back is that not so thats correct so it was when you disobeyed mr ogilvies orders that ashton was killed i was very angry but kept my voice calm ashton was going straight into the army training area which was very dangerous the most important thing was to stop him it was a complete shock to me that benson killed him but we cant be sure that benson killed ashton objected lord cregar the bullets from the body prove that said ogilvie but mr jaggard has failed throughout this operation he let ashton escape in england and he has now caused a great deal of trouble because of the stupid way he tried to deal with ashton in sweden i said once before that i did not have a very high opinion of mr jaggard and i think i was right i felt very miserable and wondered if cregar was right after the committee meeting ogilvie invited me to lunch not because he was sorry for me and not because he wanted to be friendly to my great surprise he wanted to continue to investigate the ashton case and that was to be my new job as far as everyone else was concerned i had made a terrible mistake and i had to be punished but ogilvie thought that his department had been tricked over ashton he wanted to know who had tricked him and why and he thought that i was the best man to find this out i was not at all happy with this plan it would mean more lying to penny and i had done enough damage to our personal lives already ashton had been killed and i felt that i was responsible for that ogilvie disagreed you didnt kill ashton who did benson killed him damn it ogilvie raised his voice to a shout then find out why for gods sake dont do it for me do it for penny find out why benson who lived so long in the same house with her father with her and her sister find out why benson killed her father you owe that to her all right i said youve convinced me ill do it for her after i left ogilvie i said goodbye to the people i had worked with in the department they felt sorry for me because my new job was as far as they knew as a messenger but there were no messages for me to take in fact i went off to start the investigation which ogilvie wanted me to do i went out to marlow to find out if penny was back from scotland as i arrived i bumped into peter michaelis who was just leaving the ashton house what the devil are you doing here i asked playing model trains he replied happily miss ashton gave me permission to use the set upstairs whenever i like it really is a fantastic railway here look at this book he showed me a thick book of railway timetables ashton was trying to run this old timetable but it doesnt seem quite correct its not the same as the original timetable so im going to try to compare his timetable with one that ive got at home which miss ashton gave you permission to do this i asked gillian he replied i used to talk to her a lot when she was in hospital when she found i was interested in the model railway she said i could come along and play with it shes a nice girl and we get on very well he paused i dont spend all my time with the railway i smiled is gillian here now yes she is and shes expecting penny home for lunch penny was very pleased to see me ogilvie had told her that i had been on some secret job in the united states when her father was killed i was very grateful for this lie it made it easier for me to avoid telling her too many direct lies penny asked me if i knew anything more about her fathers death i told her that i knew little more than she did but why had he gone to sweden malcolm you were investigating him didnt you find out anything at all not really at first we thought that he had run away because of the attack on gillian but when we found that man mayberry that idea led nowhere as far as we know your father was having a long quiet holiday in sweden there was nothing wrong in that but we still dont know why he ran away so suddenly well probably never know i suppose youre right malcolm but what he did was so strange it wasnt like him at all im still very puzzled and worried i need time to think about it and to think about us too i can understand that i said and i dont mind its been a terrible time for you and gillian what is she going to do were both going to america soon and the doctors there will try to repair the damage to her face the house is going to be sold while were away she fell silent and afraid that she would ask more questions about her father i changed the subject again what were you doing in scotland i asked oh i was asked to advise on the building of a new laboratory i think it needs to be p and they only want to go to p i dont understand i said what are p and p oh i forgot im so used to talking about my work with daddy id forgotten you dont know much about genetics daddy always seemed to understand what i was talking about so easily are you sure you want me to explain she looked at me doubtfully its a bit technical yes please i replied im not a complete idiot but dont make it too complicated well in scientists studying genetics were very worried by the possible dangers of the experiments that were being done there were no government laws to follow but everyone felt that something had to be done so the scientists agreed among themselves about safety and the kind of experiments that should be permitted for the first time scientists became their own police and did not wait for governments to make laws for them genetics laboratories go from p to p pi is the ordinary basic genetics laboratory p is for highly dangerous experiments where everything has to be totally safe in all possible conditions airlocks showers changes of clothing that sort of thing and your problem in scotland is all about safety well theyve got a p laboratory and the work they do is changing i believe they need to make it a p laboratory but thats very very expensive and they only want to go to p why is that i said well they want to work with bacteria called e coli which are harmless everyone has millions of them in his body its not dangerous to study them but nobody knows what could happen if someone does an important experiment and transfers the wrong gene everything is so new in this branch of science there are no laws at least no man made laws to decide what should be done and what should not be done but youre the expert if you think its dangerous surely people will listen to you i said puzzled not necessarily in the end its the politicians who tell you how much money you can spend how safe you can make an important laboratory but their reasons are not usually scientific everything always seems to come back to money and politicians i thought to myself are they really the best people to decide chapter twelve the secret computer somewhere the key to ashtons death lay in bensons life and i decided to investigate everything about howard benson ogilvie had told me that there was no information in the computer about benson but i remembered putting all the ashton names and bensons through the computer right at the beginning bensons records had been there then but locked away in level purple what had happened to them had somebody taken bensons records out of the computer it was a puzzle i couldnt solve so i went to the war office to see if i could look at bensons army records from thirty years before all i knew was that benson had been a soldier during the war but i had no idea when he had left the army it took several hours of searching through long lists of names and numbers before i discovered to my total amazement that ashton and benson had left the british army on exactly the same day th january i knew from the computer that george ashton was not a real british soldier but a russian scientist in disguise the coincidence was too great so if it wasnt a coincidence it must have been planned but who had planned it was benson another russian what reason could there be to explain why he had left the army on the same day as george ashton and then worked for and lived with ashton for more than thirty years i took bensons army file home and read it very carefully everything seemed normal exactly as ogilvie had found when he had investigated benson then i suddenly noticed one strange point when bensons departure from the army was first mentioned an officer had written proposed leaving date st march but benson had actually left on th january was the difference important the health of every soldier is carefully watched and recorded and i looked at bensons medical record in the army early in november he had complained that he had pains in his left arm in december the doctor had asked for a special examination of bensons heart and three weeks later in january benson had left the army i telephoned a friend of mine who was a doctor if a man in his early thirties complains of a pain in his left arm for three months what could be wrong with him i asked that depends he replied it could be one of several things if its a friend of yours tell him to go to a doctor at once why is it so serious it could be a kind of heart disease he replied is that bad i asked would the man survive that depends again said the doctor is he fit does he smoke i remembered that benson had had a desk job in the army lets suppose that hes not fit and that he smokes then he could drop dead at any time if he doesnt get the right treatment immediately malcolm is this someone i know no i replied there was a man in that condition in he died a few weeks ago thirty years later what do you think of that im very surprised most people with that condition would have died long ago the next person i spoke to was bensons last doctor in marlow he was not keen to tell me about bensons health but i asked him when benson had last had a heart attack he laughed and said i can certainly tell you about that there was absolutely nothing wrong with bensons heart it was in excellent condition i thanked him and rang off it was now fairly clear to me what had happened the real benson had suffered from a bad heart and had died after th december and before th january somehow a new healthy benson had taken his place had left the army on th january and had then remained very close to george ashton until the day thirty years later when he had killed him i had learned something but i still did not know why benson had killed george ashton it was time for penny and gillian to leave for america they had decided to sell the house at marlow and the auction was going to be held while they were away gillian expected to be in america for quite a long time but penny hoped to be back after a week or two she was then supposed to go back to visit the laboratory in scotland it was about this time that i began to feel that somebody had given me quite a lot of valuable information but i had failed to recognize its full importance what was it i thought about it for hours but the right piece of information refused to come to the surface of my mind something i had heard or maybe something i had read was the key to the problem but i could not find out what it was no matter how much i tried on the day of the auction i went to the ashtons house near marlow to my surprise michaelis was there looking as unhappy as i felt im glad gillian isnt here to see this he remarked as we looked around the rooms full of articles for sale its all so sad to see everything being sold off like this but the model railway interests me i thought id like to buy a bit of it but i dont think ill have a chance lucas hartman is here whos he i asked a rich american who collects model railways hell buy the whole thing i expect itll probably cost him maybe more but hell buy it so much over for a model railway i dont believe it i said wait and see replied michaelis and what annoys me is that i never got to understand the system ashtons timetables didnt fit you remember i showed you his big books of railway timetables the old london midland and scottish railway yes i remember you were going to compare them with the original ones werent they the same no theyre completely different the pattern of ashtons timetables doesnt seem to be like any normal system of railway timetabling i just couldnt understand it as michaelis was talking i had a picture in my mind of george ashton as he lay dying in the snow trying to give me a swedish railway timetable it was as if a bomb exploded in my head by god thats it i whispered thats got to be it michaelis stared at me whats wrong come on i said weve got to speak to the auctioneer five minutes later we were talking to the man in charge of the auction im speaking for the ashton sisters penelope and gillian you mustnt sell the model railway upstairs im not so sure i can do that said the auctioneer you say you speak for the ashton sisters can you prove it no i cant at the moment im sorry mr jaggard he said i was engaged by miss penelope ashton to sell the contents of this house i can t stop that without a letter from her but shes in the united states i almost shouted then theres nothing to be done he said the sale must go ahead i tried ringing ogilvie pennys lawyer even penny herself in america but i could find none of them finally i rang my bank manager what can i do for you mr jaggard he asked later this afternoon im going to write a fairly large cheque more than i have in my bank account at the moment i want to borrow enough money to cover a cheque for or even for a month can i do that yes i dont see any difficulty mr jaggard well cover your cheque i hope you know what youre doing in any case come and see me tomorrow about it ill need your signature on some papers i put the phone down michaelis was looking at me as if he thought i had suddenly gone mad listen i said i think weve found ashtons secret hiding place i think that model railway is a computer a sort of mechanical computer you couldnt understand ashtons railway timetables you said they didnt fit the original ones well i dont think theyre timetables at all theyre computer programs and thats where ashton had been hiding all his original thinking thats what he was trying to tell me when he gave me that swedish railway timetable just before he died michaelis shook his head its a crazy idea he said slowly but i suppose you might be right i hope to god i am right i said im taking a big risk a very expensive risk we went back to the room where everything was being sold the auctioneer was just starting to sell the railway ladies and gentlemen this is a unique model railway with the most modern control equipment it is one of the finest examples of model railways that we have ever seen how much will you offer me for it the offers started at and went up slowly to hartman had said nothing but suddenly he offered i held up a finger and the auctioneer said i have seventeen thousand pounds will anyone offer me more than seventeen thousand pounds hartman raised his finger to offer the only two people crazy enough to spend so much money for a model railway were hartman and myself the price went up and up finally i won hartman stopped and the auctioneer called out sold to mr jaggard for just as i was talking to the auctioneer michaelis called me to the telephone it was ogilvie i told him what i had done i told him that the department now owed me for a model railway i do not wish to write down the words that he used to describe me chapter thirteen ashtons work and bensons secret from america penny wrote to say that the operations on gillians face were going well she said that gillian wanted me to pass this news on to peter michaelis as she could not write herself in her next letter penny asked me to meet her at heathrow airport and that made me feel a lot better if she had decided not to marry me she would not have asked me to meet her when i met her she was very tired but i took her to her new flat in london and we sat talking for a while she told me about her visits to several american universities theyre doing very good work with pv she said whats pv i asked something to do with genetics oh its a virus but its harmless to human beings she laughed i keep forgetting that you dont know anything about genetics suddenly the little worrying thought at the back of my mind expressed itself when your father was alive did you talk to him a lot about your work i asked oh yes penny replied all the time he knew quite a lot about it and he understood things very quickly he even made some suggestions which surprised professor lumsden why was that well daddy never did any experiments in genetics he learned things from talking with me but some of the ideas he had were very clever they were unusual but they worked when lumsden and i tried them out in the laboratory i felt like a man who has just found a key after looking for it for many weeks the next day i went to see ogilvie he had been very suspicious of my ideas about the model railway but he had agreed to investigate it the railway had been moved to a secret place and the computer experts had begun work on it at first they thought it was a great joke of course but after a while they realized that it was definitely a computer and that the timetables were detailed programs unfortunately they had not been able to understand the programs yet but at least i was not the poorer i told ogilvie about my latest idea i think we can guess what ashtons computer programs are all about the date of the first one is about the time penny started her research in genetics i believe ashton taught himself genetics because that was what his daughter was studying he used her books and her notes and didnt need to buy anything which would tell outsiders what he was studying she could keep him up to date with the latest developments without anyone ever suspecting that he was busy learning the subject probably even better than penny herself knew it and all without ever going near a laboratory if youre right said ogilvie what do we do about it talk to penny of course i said tell her what we think see if she agrees let her tell us what she knows no thats too risky he said wed have to tell her too much about her father and why he wanted to hide what he was doing but you cant keep this secret from her not if you want to understand it shes a part of it now he learned everything from her i said angrily calm down malcolm i didnt say anything about secrets i just said wed have to be very careful about what we say you can leave that side of things to me so dont worry about it after that meeting i had a strange suspicion that ogilvie was not being completely honest with me it was the first time i had ever felt that about him and i didnt like it i went to see penny that afternoon at university college as i passed professor lumsdens office lord cregar came out he looked very surprised and demanded what are you doing here i didnt think it had anything to do with him and replied just visiting he stopped and said you know the ashton case is closed yes of course i replied then you know you shouldnt be coming here to ask questions im sorry lord cregar but i dont think i have to ask your permission when i want to visit the girl im going to marry oh he said id forgotten his eyes changed and lost their suspicion im sorry about that id forgotten that youre engaged to dr ashton i wish you both every happiness but now i must go im in a bit of a hurry as he hurried off along the corridor i wondered why his first thought on seeing me was to think it had something to do with the ashton case that evening penny invited me to dinner in her new flat after dinner as we were sitting having coffee she said quietly when would you like us to get married malcolm that night the coffee got spilt on the carpet and i stayed for breakfast the next day penny had to go to scotland because she was still involved in arguments about the safety of the laboratory there for me the rest of the week went by very slowly i bought some tickets for the theatre for the day when penny was due to return and i went on with my work i had learned nothing new about benson and the computer experts were not making much progress towards understanding ashtons programs ogilvie seemed to be avoiding me but i did learn from him that lord cregar was now trying to persuade the minister to transfer the work on the computer programs from ogilvies department to cregars that worried me a lot cregars special interest was in biological and chemical weapons if ashtons programs were really about genetics as i thought they were they could be very useful to cregar and he would make sure they were kept very secret perhaps that was why ashton had hidden them so well to keep them from dangerous people like cregar who would use them only to increase their own power penny was expected back on tuesday and i went round to her flat i waited but she did not return early the next morning i rang professor lumsden who said he had not heard from her for several days when i asked for her telephone number in scotland he said he was not allowed to give it to me i was rather puzzled there seemed to be another mystery here and i began to get worried about penny when i got home i found that the suitcase which i had left behind in sweden had finally been sent back to me by the swedish police that gave me an idea and i drove out to the ashtons house at marlow the cases which ashton and benson had taken to sweden had also been sent back i looked at everything very carefully took everything our of the cases and examined it thoroughly but found nothing as i was putting bensons clothes back into the case his wallet fell on the floor i had already examined it once but this time when i picked it up i noticed that the silk lining was torn i examined it more closely the lining had been very carefully cut and hidden inside was a piece of paper i pulled it out it was a letter to whom it may concern this letter is carried by howard greatorex benson if anyone has any doubts or questions about his honesty his actions or his motives please contact me immediately the date on the letter was th january the day ashton and benson had left the army the letter was signed by james pallton who was now lord cregar i was getting more and more suspicious about cregar why did his name keep coming up in the ashton case i could now see that there was a strong connection between him and ashtons probable work on genetics and now lumsden and penny what exactly was going on in scotland i went to see lumsden and asked him to ring penny in scotland when he refused i got angry he would not tell me where the laboratory was or what work was being done there or even who ran it i was now very suspicious and finally got lumsden to admit that cregar was the man in charge cregar was in a hurry to get results penny had insisted on a p laboratory which was much more expensive and would take much more time to construct but that was because she was worried about safety i said yes but cregar thought she was being too careful he was pushing carter hard to get results fast replied lumsden whos carter i wanted to know the chief scientific officer theres something wrong at that laboratory im sure of it i said please telephone penny but i dont think theyll let you speak to her he hesitated for a long time but then made the call as he dialled i watched his finger and carefully remembered the number this is professor lumsden id like to speak to dr ashton yes ill wait while you get her he put his hand over the telephone and said theyve gone to get her they think shes in her room i dont think theyll find her i said suddenly lumsden spoke again to the telephone yes on the mainland i see will you ask her to telephone me as soon as she comes back he put the phone down slowly they say shes gone to the mainland so the laboratorys on an island yes he said they could be right you know they might be telling the truth but i could tell from his voice that he did not really believe his own words i dont think so i replied something has happened to her and im going to find out what it is feeling very worried i left lumsden and went to see ogilvie i marched straight into his office he was not pleased i didnt send for you he said coldly i paid no attention ive discovered bensons secret i said he was cregars man ogilvies eyes opened wide i dont believe it i put the letter on his desk read that youll see how benson was cregars spy on ashton for thirty years even when cregar was no longer responsible for ashton he still had his spy watching thats why bensons records disappeared from the computer it all fits together admitted ogilvie but i still cant believe it there must be another explanation well ill get it out of cregar even if i have to beat it out of hun penny ashton has disappeared and cregar has something to do with it what on earth are you talking about he demanded i told him about pennys work in scotland and how cregar was involved in this secret laboratory i gave him the phone number and said see if you can find out where that telephone is five minutes later he had the answer in two words cladach duillich chapter fourteen trouble in scotland cladach duillich was a hard place to get to it was one of the summer islands off the northwest coast of scotland islands which are beautiful in summer and terrible in winter i flew to inverness and hired a car to drive across scotland to ullapool the nearest fishing village to cladach duillich it was late when i arrived but i found a small hotel quite easily i managed to find a fisherman who promised to take me to cladach duillich the next morning if the weather was right before dinner i sat in the bar talking with the local people they did not know much about what happened on cladach duillich there were a few buildings that was all but the people who worked there always came and went by helicopter they never came to ullapool nobody else was allowed to land on the island what do you think theyre doing there i asked do you think its another gruinard gruinard was a scottish island where a government experiment in biological weapons had gone very wrong many years ago the island had been badly poisoned and was still too dangerous for anyone to go there it had better not be said a man called archie ferguson angrily he was a tall powerful scot with a soft voice and a fiercelooking face if we thought it was another gruinard he went on wed take the fire to it and burn everything to the ground after dinner i made a telephone call to cladach duillich a voice said how can i help you id like to speak to dr ashton my name is malcolm jaggard just a moment ill see if shes available came the reply there was a fourminute silence then another voice said im sorry mr jaggard but dr ashton went to the mainland and hasnt come back yet whereabouts on the mainland i asked there was a pause where are you speaking from mr jaggard from london why the voice did not answer the question she went to ullapool thats our nearest town she wanted to do some shopping may i ask how you got our number dr ashton gave it to me i lied when do you expect her back oh i dont know the weather has changed and i dont think shell be able to get a boat back to the island until tomorrow morning im sure shell be back then i see may i ask who im speaking to im dr carter thank you dr carter ill ring tomorrow as i put the phone down i knew that i was not the only person who was telling lies i went back to the bar and spoke to archie ferguson again ive been talking to the people on cladach duillich they told me a woman came to ullapool today from the island shes about one metre seventy tall dark hair about twenty eight years old robbie ferguson archies brother interrupted me how did she come from the island by boat i answered then she didnt come he said positively theres no boat on cladach duillich only a helicopter nobody came from the island to ullapool today i can promise you that the next morning robbie fergusons boat took me across the rough seas to cladach duillich it was a low island which looked as if the sea could cover it at any time before i left i said to archie look if im not back by four oclock this afternoon i want you to get the police and come looking for me and if they wont let us land on the island what do we do then he wanted to know i took a card from my pocket and gave it to him it i dont come back ring that number and ask for a man called ogilvie tell him everything you know ill do that and maybe well come with fire to make cladach duillich clean again fire is a great thing for destroying what is bad i did not argue with him but as robbie and i approached cladach duillich i felt better knowing that i had archie ferguson behind me in case anything went wrong he was a dependable man it was a rough voyage across the sea to cladach duillich although it was not a high island the sharp rocks made it a difficult place to land i could not think of any reason why anyone should want to build a biological laboratory there unless they had something which they very much wanted to hide robbie ferguson brought the boat in as close as he could and i jumped on to the rocky shore i saw a notice government property landing forbidden it did not say who had forbidden everyone to land on the island there were some steps leading from the rocks where i had landed when i got to the top a man came running up stop cant you read he shouted yes i can read but the boats gone well you cant stay here what do you want i want to talk to dr carter i replied what about if dr carter wants you to know what we talk about im sure hell tell you later i said sharply who are you the man said angrily same answer i replied just take me to carter very unhappily he took me along the path to the buildings of the laboratory and i took a look around cladach duillich was a small island where only the seabirds seemed to be at home there were three low buildings all connected i was taken into an office where an older man was sitting working at a desk he looked up as we entered whos this max i found this man coming ashore he says he wants to see you he turned to me who are you what do you want i sat down im malcolm laggard ive come to see dr ashton didnt you ring me last night i told you she wasnt here shes on the mainland in ullapool no she isnt ive just come from there and she wasnt there last night either i said firmly well she isnt here now he said and i must ask you to leave this place isnt open to the public if dr ashton isnt here where is she how did she get to ullapool by boat of course but you havent got a boat here dr carter all journeys are by helicopter youre taking too much of an interest in us mr laggard that could be dangerous just let dr ashton come and talk to me i replied if shes missing i promise that ill make a lot of trouble for you a voice came from behind me dr carter cant bring dr ashtori to see you i turned and saw lord cregar in the doorway dr carter leave me to talk to mr jaggard alone he went on he turned to the man i had met outside and who had brought me m search him max make sure he hasnt got a gun no gun said max after he had searched me carefully oh well even if he hasnt got a gun he could still get drowned if he was on the island trying to break into these buildings couldnt he said cregar calmly no problem sir said max unfeelingly the waves sometimes break right over the island youd better be careful lord cregar i said weve found the connection between you and benson cregar looked surprised how could i have a connection with benson what possible evidence could there be a letter carried by benson dated january and signed by you a letter said cregar and he looked through me into the past his eyes changed as he began to remember you mean benson still carried that letter with him after thirty years i dont believe it where is it now ogilvie has it hes probably shown it to the minister by now cregar was angry im not going to let you beat me jaggard max put this man somewhere safe while i think ive found my way out of bigger problems than this its a question of studying the weaknesses of each man you and ogilvie what about penny ashton i said angrily whats happened to her youll see her in good time said cregar coldly if i allow you to in my anger i wanted to attack him violently but max had a gun in his hand so i could do nothing i was taken along a corridor and into a small dark room the door closed heavily behind me and i was left alone in the dark to think about my problems i realized that it had been a good idea to tell cregar about the letter that had saved me before i had mentioned the letter cregar was thinking of having me thrown into the sea but the knowledge that ogilvie had the letter had stopped that plan but i now had a very clear idea of just how dangerous cregar could be i was in that black room lor many hours but finally the door opened max was there with his gun and safely behind him stood cregar looking relaxed come with me he said and i followed him along the corridor with max walking behind me his gun in his hand ive found a way of dealing with ogilvie therell be no problem there said cregar casually but that still leaves you after youve seen dr ashton well have a talk he stopped at a door in here he said i went into a room with a large window which looked into another room there was a bed in that room and a woman was lying in the bed unconscious with plastic tubes leading from her to various machines i could hardly recognize any penny in gods name what happened i shouted at cregar there was an accident last week im afraid dr ashton is rather ill whats wrong with her i shouted again we dont know its something new and carter cant identify it i was very angry and very frightened for penny its your fault isnt it she wanted you to have a p laboratory and you were too mean this place isnt safe why isnt she being properly looked after she should be in a hospital one of the best hospitals youre probably right said cregar calmly but that would create risks for me not health risks but risks of security this is a topsecret laboratory but you cant leave her to die here she needs to have the very best of medical treatment i shouted at cregar youre in no position to make demands of me said cregar and walked out i followed him along the corridor to carters laboratory we went inside through an airlock between two doors there were glass cases all around the walls containing small dishes with carters experimental bacteria each dish was in its own protective glass box cregar turned to me look you can see we do take care here what happened to dr ashton was an accident a million to one chance its very important to me that you believe me if youd listened to her it wouldnt have happened i said but i believe you i dont think it was done on purpose whats so important about what i think anyway well i can come to an agreement with ogilvie but i still have to make sure you dont give away my secrets have you spoken with ogilvie i asked yes of course he understands i felt sick with disgust even ogilvie seemed to be willing to hide the truth to allow himself to be bribed by this dangerous government official i knew then that i would never work with ogilvie again the trouble is that you have to be around jaggard for some time to come if anything happened to you ogilvie might change his mind thats too great a risk and it creates a problem for me how to keep my mouth shut without actually killing me exactly you are a man like myself we go straight to the heart of any problem but i think we can do business ill exchange the life of dr ashton for your silence i looked at cregar with total disgust he had said that the solution to his problem would be found by studying mens weaknesses and he had found mine as soon as you agree dr ashton can be taken to hospital theres a document i want you to sign itll make sure that you remain silent a telephone rang cregar told max to give him the gun and then answer the call there was silence as max listened saying only who where how many he put the phone down theres trouble outside a lot of men are landing on the island who are they said cregar local people stupid scots fishermen go and chase them away max as max left cregar turned to me and asked is this anything to do with you how could i start a local war i asked but i want penny in hospital fast how do we get off here a phone call will bring a helicopter in two hours youd better make that phone call then i replied while he was thinking about what i had just said i hit him hard in the stomach as he fell to the floor his gun went off the bullet missed me but i heard the crash of breaking glass by the time he picked himself up i was holding the gun whats the number to ring for the helicopter i said you cant win jaggard shouted cregar nobody will ever believe your word rather than mine he turned his head noticed the broken glass and screamed oh god look what youve done im getting out of here two of the glass cases in the laboratory were broken and the contents of the dishes had spilled on the floor cregar tried to push past me to get out of the room he did not seem to care about the gun so i hit him over the head and he fell to the floor unconscious i turned quickly as the door of the laboratory burst open and archie ferguson appeared get out i shouted get out its not safe go next door and ill talk to you the door sbut very quickly and a moment later i saw archie through the glass window of carters laboratory cregar still lay unconscious at my feet chapter fifteen biological disaster there was a microphone on one of the tables in carters laboratory i picked it up with a shaking hand and spoke can you hear me archie he nodded and picked up another microphone whats happened here malcolm he asked this place is bloody dangerous archie dont go into any of the laboratories go and tell your men that wow archie dropped the microphone and ran off quickly to tell his men after a few minutes he came back and i told him to arrest everybody on the island i showed him my official identity card and said that gives you the power to arrest people the government will support that youre working under my instructions what do we do now he wanted to know ring ogilvie and let me speak to him i darent come out of this laboratory i dont know what experiments theyre doing here but the bacteria weve accidentally released are almost certainly very dangerous when i turned round cregar was starting to wake up but he said nothing the call to ogilvie came through before he could start asking questions i said sharply this is an emergency cregars laboratory has gone wrong theres one serious case of infection and two suspected cases the bacteria causing it are new to medicine probably manmade and highly infectious we need immediate hospital treatment for three people in p conditions i suggest the biological centre at porton down ill get that arranged at once said ogilvie who are the three people in danger the serious case is penelope ashton there was a gasp at the other end of the line oh my god im sorry malcolm came ogilvies voice i went on the suspected cases are cregar and myself for gods sake malcolm whats been happening up there youd better ask carter hes the man in charge of the experiments up here but make it quick i think penny is dying when i had finished talking to ogilvie archie ferguson picked up his microphone he had been listening to the conversation and was very angry he wanted to throw cregar and the others into the sea but i persuaded him that that was too dangerous for the fish i asked him to find me a cassetterecorder and food for cregar and me he was unhappy at the thought of getting food for cregar but did it and pushed it into the laboratory i got the cassetterecorder ready cregar did not seem interested it was as if he had given up nothing matters any more he said how did benson learn about ashtons work i asked oh that was a long time ago five years ago at least he saw that ashton was helping his daughter with her studies but also starting to do a lot of work on his own we never knew what it was he hid it from benson and we thought it was hidden in his secret room he stopped and looked up at me youre a clever man i never thought of the railway i should have done ashton wasnt the sort of man to play with toy trains now that he had started to tell the truth cregars voice flowed on i suppose he thought there was no reason to keep silent it was a sort of deathbed confession i asked him about mayberrys attack on gillian i had nothing to do with thati said cregar it was senseless i didnt even know mayberry existed until the police found him but i was ready to take advantage of it i had the flat in stockholm ready and the false passport it only needed benson to persuade ashton that his girls were in danger and that my department had a safe house for him in sweden he ran away all i wanted to do was look in his secret room but it was empty i began to see why so many misunderstandings had happened ashton had never known the truth and neither had i but why on earth did benson kill ashton orders from thirty years ago to make sure ashton didnt go back to the russians i never thought to cancel the order and benson remembered it after all those years i can hardly believe it cregar seemed almost proud of bensons loyalty even though it had led to ashtons unnecessary death out of curiosity i asked cregar why did you do all this he looked at me in surprise a man must do something important in his life something that people will remember i stared at him and felt cold to my bones he carried on talking about power and politics but i was no longer interested finally ogilvie rang to say there was a helicopter with a specialist medical team on its way to us the men who came were dressed in plastic clothing from head to foot just like men from space they put us in plastic envelopes and carried us away to hospital i never saw cregar again chapter sixteen my new job a month later i came out of the special hospital where a team of thirty doctors and nurses had looked after me penny had even more doctors than i had because her condition was worse than mine but ogilvie and lumsden had brought the best doctors from the united states and from europe and they had succeeded in saving pennys life dr starkie was the man in charge if dr ashton had been on cladach duillich for one more day without proper medical attention she would be dead now he said you were both very lucky slowly penny began to get better i couldnt kiss her or even touch her in her protective glass cage but we began to talk about getting married she said she thought a double wedding would be nice michaelis had asked gillian to marry him i was not too surprised at that piece ot news ogilvie had come to visit me in hospital ive listened to the cassette of your conversation with cregar he said i dont think even cregar can escape from this problem have the computer experts had any success with ashtons computer programs i asked yes and my god theyre fantastic everyone said the man was a genius and hes proved it how is that whats he done well i dont really understand it said ogilvie but it seems that ashton has done for genetics what einstein did for physics he studied genctics from a mathematical point of view and has shown that genetics has a mathematical basis hes been able to show what genetic arrangements are possible or not possible without depending on laboratory experiments for each arrangement its quite fantastic that should make professor lumsden happy i said he doesnt know said ogilvie the information is still secret why the minister thinks that there are good reasons for keeping it secret at least for a while we have to study how useful the information could be i felt disgusted the minister was another cregar he had found a piece of important information and that gave him power as long as it was secret he was going to hold on to it i began to realize why ashton had hidden his ideas it was to keep them away from men like cregar and the minister ogilvie went on when youve fully recovered and get back to work ive got a new job for you i want to prepare you for kerrs job hes going to retire in two years and youre the right man for the job kerr was number two to ogilvie in the department when i retire in seven years time ogilvie continued you could be head of the department get lost i said bluntly i dont want the job ogilvie was shocked what did you say whats got into you malcolm you werent interested in what was right or wrong you were going to do a deal with cregar he told me he had come to an agreement with you i was shocked cregar called me an honest man but to cregar that isnt a good thing it just meant he didnt know how to buy me he could buy everyone else so that they would do what he said even you thats why i dont want your job i might become like you how could an honest man do what we did to george ashton malcolm i dont think that youre being sensible about this he replied angrily im a human being i try to be honest and i want to stay that way your job would destroy that part of me ogilvie went away very unhappy chapter seventeen the future and we all lived happily ever after at least thats what would have happened in the oldfashioned kind of story we all used to read when we were children but my story is different penny came out of hospital fully recovered gillian came back from new york looking better than she had before the acid attack together with michaelis we all went out for dinner and planned a wonderful double wedding ten days before the wedding i went back to see dr starkie he asked me a lot of questions gave me a lot of medical tests and told me to come back in a week on the day i went back to see him i read in the times that lord cregar had died i was disgusted by what was written about him a loyal public servant who worked for his country for many years with no thought for himself that was not the cregar who had been quite prepared to let penny and me die on cladach duillich in order to save himself dr starkie was very serious when i saw him its bad news isnt it i said yes it is he said directly its cancer it was the news i had expected how long have i got six months maybe a year it could be longer but not much is this the same thing that killed cregar i asked yes he sighed cregar wanted fast results and carter didnt wait for the best quality materials to come from the states he used some experimental bacteria which were difficult to control biologically and he didnt have the right kind of laboratory penny ashton was right there the new bacteria that escaped when you and cregar were in the laboratory werent safe i suddenly felt frightened what about penny shes all right her illness was caused by completely different bacteria i felt relieved thank you dr starkie youve been very honest with me and i appreciate it i went back to london and told penny the bad news she understood immediately what had happened it was her job after all she still wanted to get married but i said no i knew what i wanted to do theres a place in the south of ireland i said to penny the mountains are green the sea is blue when the sun shines and its green when the sun doesnt shine its by the sea where the atlantic waves come in from the west come live with me and be my love i could do with six months of life there if you are with me we went to ireland immediately after gillian and peter were married and we wished them every happiness we have lived here for nine months my condition has got gradually worse and at one time i thought of killing myself but i knew i had one final job to do to write the story of the ashton case penny has loved me and taken care of me she has brought a doctor and three nurses to help her but now my time is getting short i have told the story honestly god knows i am not proud of my own part in it penny has read the story some parts have upset her terribly some parts have made her laugh other parts have made her sad she has typed it all herself i want people to be able to read my story to know what is done by governments in the name of the people there are too many cregars around in government ashtons new work on genetics is still a secret to be used for whatever purposes some government minister thinks will do him some good because of that penny and i are determined that her fathers story and the news of his discoveries in genetics should not be hidden we have done what we can to make sure that the story will be published in full this story and my lite are now coming to an end it is not a happy story in the words of an american writer we have met the enemy and he is us i hope for your sake that he is wrong the end
