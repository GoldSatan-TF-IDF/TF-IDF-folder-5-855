conclusion the erie train boy chapter i on the erie road papers magazines all the popular novels cant i sell you something this morning joshua bascom turned as the train boy addressed him and revealed an honest sunburned face lighted up with pleasurable excitement for he was a farmers son and was making his first visit to the city of new york i aint much on story readin he said i tried to read a story book once but i couldnt seem to get interested in it what was the name of it asked fred the train boy smiling it was the pilgrims progress or some such name it had pictures into it aunt nancy

interestin lookin out of the winder at the sights im going to york to spend a week added joshua with an air of importance thats where i live said the train boy do you then you might tell me where to put up ive got ten dollars i reckon that ought to keep me a week fred smiled that is more than enough to keep me he said but it costs a stranger considerable to go around but i shall have to go my rounds it was a train on the erie road and the car had just passed middletown joshua was sitting by the window and the seat beside him was vacant the train boy had scarcely left the car when a stylishly dressed young man who had been sitting behind came forward and accosted joshua is this seat engaged he asked not as i know of answered the young farmer then with your permission i will take it said the stranger why of course i haint no objection hes dreadful polite thought joshua you are from the country i presume said the newcomer as he sank into the seat yes i be i live up elmira way town of barton was you ever in barton i have passed through it i suppose you are engaged in agricultural pursuits hey you are a farmer i take it yes i work on dads farm he owns a hundred and seventyfive acres and me and a hired man help him to carry it on i tell you we have to work just so and now you are taking a vacation yes ive come to see the sights of york i think you will enjoy your visit ahem the mayor of new york is my uncle you dont say ejaculated joshua awestruck yes my name is ferdinand morris glad to know you mr morris my name is joshua bascom indeed an aunt of mine married a bascom perhaps we are related joshua was quite elated at the thought that he might in some way be related to the mayor of new york without knowing it and he resolved to expatiate on that subject when he went back to barton he decided that his new acquaintance must be rich for he was dressed in showy style and had a violet in his buttonhole be you in business mr morris he asked well ahem i am afraid that i am rather an idler my father left me a quarter of a million and so i dont feel the need of working quarter of a million ejaculated joshua why thats two hundred and fifty thousand dollars just so said morris smiling thats an awful pile of money why dads been workin all his life and he isnt wuth moren three thousand dollars at the outside i am afraid three thousand dollars wouldnt last me a very long time said morris with an amused smile gosh where can anybody get such a pile of money thats what beats me business my young friend business why ive made that amount of money in one day you dont say yes by speculating in wall street you must be smart my teachers didnt seem to think so but life in the city is very different from life in the country i wish i could make some money a man must have money to make money if now you had a little money ive got ten dollars to pay my expenses is that all no ive got fifteen dollars to buy a shawl and dress for marm and some shirts for dad he thought hed like some boughten shirts the last marm made for him didnt fit very well you must take good care of your money mr bascom i regret to say that we have a great many pickpockets in new york so ive heerd thats what jim duffy told me he went to york last spring but i guess jim was keerless or he wouldnt have been robbed it would take a smart pickpocket to rob me then you keep your money in a safe place yes i keep my wallet in my breeches pocket and joshua slapped the right leg of his trousers in a well satisfied way you are right i see you are a man of the world you are a sharp one joshua laughed gleefully he felt pleased at the compliment yes he chuckled i aint easy taken in i tell you ef i was born in the woods it is easy to see that you can take care of yourself so i can that comes of being a bascom i am glad to know that we are related you must call on me in new york where do you live at the fifth avenue hotel just ask for ferdinand morris they all know me there is that a good place to stop yes if youve got money enough i pay five dollars a day for my board and some extras carry it up to fifty dollars a week gosh all hemlock ejaculated joshua i dont want to pay no moren five dollars a week you can perhaps find a cheap boardinghouse for that sum with plain board of course thats what im used to im willin to get along without pie you like pie then we ginerally have it on the table at every meal but i can wait till i get home i will see what i can do for you in fact all youve got to do is to buy a morning paper and pick out a boardinghouse where the price will suit you you must come and dine with me some day at the fifth avenue hotel thank you youre awful kind but im afraid i aint dressed up enough for such a stylish place well perhaps not but i might lend you a suit to go to the table in we are about the same build if youve got an extra suit an extra suit mr bascom i have at least twenty extra suits geewhillikens what do you want with so many clothes i never wear the same suit two days in succession but i must bid you good morning mr bascom i have a friend in the next car morris rose and joshua feeling much flattered with his polite attentions resumed his glances out of the window apples oranges bananas called the train boy entering the car with a basket of fruit how much do you charge asked joshua i feel kind of hungry and i havent ate an orange for an age last time i bought one was at the grocery up to hum the large oranges are five cents apiece said fred i can give you two small ones for the same price ill take two small ones it seems a great deal of money but im traveling and that makes a difference here are two good ones said fred picking out a couple all right ill take em joshua bascom thrust his hand into his pocket and then a wild spasm contracted his features he explored it with growing excitement and a sickly pallor overspread his face whats the matter asked fred ive been robbed my wallets gone groaned joshua in a husky voice chapter ii a fair exchange who can have robbed you asked the train boy sympathetically i dunno answered joshua sadly how much have you lost twentyfive dollars no continued mr bascom with a shade of relief i put dads fifteen dollars in my inside vest pocket that is lucky so youve only lost ten it was all i had to spend in york i guess ill have to turn round and go back but who could have taken it who has been with you only mr morris a rich young man he is nephew to the mayor of new york who said so he told me so himself how was he dressed asked fred whose suspicions were aroused did he wear a white hat yes and looked like a swell yes he got off at the last station it is he that robbed you but it cant be said joshua earnestly he told me he was worth quarter of a million dollars and boarded at the fifth avenue hotel and was nephew of the mayor yes fred laughed he is no more the mayors nephew than i am he said he is a confidence man how do you know asked joshua perplexed that is the way they all act he saw you were a countryman and made up his mind to rob you did you tell him where you kept your money yes i did he told me there was lots of pickpockets in new york and said i ought to be keerful he ought to know cant i get my money back asked mr bascom anxiously i dont think theres much chance even if you should see him some time you couldnt prove that he robbed you id like to see him for five minutes said the young farmer with a vengeful light in his eyes what would you do id give him an allfired shakin up thats what id do looking at mr bascoms broad shoulders and muscular arms fred felt that he would be likely to keep his word in a most effectual manner i dont know what to do groaned joshua relapsing into gloom as he spoke he slid his hand into his pocket once more and quickly drew it out with an expression of surprise he held between two fingers a handsome gold ring set with a neat stone where did that come from he asked didnt you ever see it before inquired the train boy never set eyes on it in my life thats a joke exclaimed fred with a laugh whats a joke why the thief in drawing your wallet from your pocket dropped his ring youve made an exchange that is all what is it worth asked joshua eagerly permit me my friend said a gentleman sitting just behind as he extended his hand for the ring i am a jeweler and can probably give you an idea of the value of the ring joshua handed it over readily the jeweler eyed it carefully and after a pause handed it back my friend he said that ring is worth fifty dollars fifty dollars ejaculated joshua his eyes distended with surprise i cant understand it cousin sue has got a gold ring as big as this that only cost three dollars and a half very likely but the stone of this is valuable youve made money out of your pickpocket if he only took ten dollars from you but hell come back for it the jeweler laughed if he does tell him where you found it and ask how it came in your pocket he wont dare to call for it id rather have the ten dollars than the ring ill tell you what ill do ill advance you twentyfive dollars on the ring and agree to give it back to you any time within a year on payment of that sum and suitable interest you can have it mister said joshua promptly as he pocketed the roll of bills given him in exchange his face glowed with returning sunshine by gosh he said ive made fifteen dollars that isnt a bad days work said fred its moren i ever earned in a month before said the young farmer i declare its paid me to come to the city you are lucky look out for pickpockets as they dont always give anything in exchange now you can afford to buy some oranges give me two fivecent oranges and a banana said mr bascom with reckless extravagance i guess i can afford it now ive made fifteen dollars i wish that pickpocket would rob me said fred smiling fifteen dollars would come in handy just now and his smile was succeeded by a grave look for money was scarce with the little household of which he was a member it is time to speak more particularly of fred who is the hero of this story he was a pleasantlooking but resolute and manly boy of seventeen who had now been for some months employed on the erie road he had lost a place which he formerly occupied in a store on account of the failure of the man whom he served and after some weeks of enforced leisure had obtained his present position train boys are required to deposit with the company ten dollars to protect their employer from possible loss this sum to be returned at the end of their term of service they are besides obliged to buy an official cap such as those of my readers who have traveled on any line of railroad are familiar with fred had been prevented for some weeks from taking the place because he had not the money required as a deposit at length a gentleman who had confidence in him went with him to the superintendent and supplied the sum and this removing the last obstacle fred fenton began his daily runs he was paid by a twenty per cent commission on sales it was necessary therefore for him to take in five dollars in order to make one for himself he had thus far managed to average about a dollar a day and this though small was an essential help to his widowed mother with whom he lived just before reaching jersey city joshua bascom appealed to fred could you tell me where to stop in york he asked some nice cheap place i know a plain boardinghouse kept by a policemans wife who lives near us said fred she would probably board you for five dollars a week by hokey thats just the place said joshua if you do it ill make it right with you never mind about that said fred all youve got to do is to come with me it will be no trouble chapter iii freds rich relation it was seven oclock when fred reached home he and his mother occupied three rooms in a tenement house at a rental of ten dollars a month it was a small sum for the city but as fred was the chief contributor to the family funds rent day was always one of anxiety it so happened that this very day rent was due and fred felt anxious for his mother when he left home had but seven dollars towards it he opened the door of their humble home and received a welcoming smile from mrs fenton a pleasantlooking woman of middle age i am glad to see you back fred she said the days seem long without you have you brought me a picture book fred asked his little brother no bertie i cant bring you picture books every day i wish i could albert has been drawing from his last book said mrs fenton he really has quite a taste for it we must send him to the cooper institute drawing school when he gets older did the landlord come mother yes answered mrs fenton a shade passing over her face what did he say did he make any fuss he was rough and unpleasant he said he mast have his money promptly or we must vacate the rooms did he take the seven dollars yes he took it and gave me a receipt on account he said he must have the balance tomorrow i dont see how we can pay it the company owes me more but i shant get paid till saturday night dont they advance it to you it is against the rule besides i couldnt get it in time there is a lady in lexington avenue owing me four dollars for sewing but when i went there today i heard that she was out of town it is very provoking to be kept out of your money when you need it so much if we only had a little money ahead we could get along well something must be done but i dont know what you might go round to cousin ferguson i hate to ask a favor of that man mother you remember that your poor father owned a small tract of land in colorado when robert ferguson went out three months since i asked him to look after it and ascertain whether it was of any value as i have heard nothing from him i am afraid it is worthless i will go and ask him mother that is a matter of business and i dont mind speaking to him on that subject i will go at once perhaps he may be willing to advance a few dollars on it at any rate i will go robert ferguson lived in a plain brick house on east thirtyninth street he was a downtown merchant and in possession of a snug competence mrs fenton was his own cousin but he had never offered to help her in any way though he was quite aware of the fact that she was struggling hard to support her little family he had a son raymond who was by no means as plain in his tastes as his father but had developed a tendency to extravagance which augured ill for his future he had never cared to cultivate the acquaintance of his poor cousins and whenever he met fred treated him with illconcealed contempt it so happened that he was just leaving the house as fred ascended the steps good morning raymond said fred politely oh its you is it yes answered fred briefly for he did not like the style in which his cousin addressed him what do you want round here i want to see your father i guess hes busy i want to see him on business said fred pulling the bell if you want to borrow any money its no use i struck him for ten dollars just now and he only gave me two did i say i wanted to borrow any money no you didnt say so but i couldnt think of any other business you could have fred did not have occasion to answer for here the door opened and the servant stood on the threshold is mr ferguson at home he asked yes will you come in fred followed the girl into the back parlor where robert ferguson sat reading the evening paper he looked up as fred entered good evening mr ferguson he said good evening frederick said his relative coldly my mother asked me to call and inquire whether you heard anything of fathers land in colorado ahem coughed mr ferguson i hope she built no day dreams on its possible value no sir but she hoped it might be worth something even a small sum would be of value to us the fact is these western lands are worth little or nothing father used to say that some time or other the land would be worth a good sum then i dont think much of your fathers judgment why i dont believe you could give it away let me see how much was there a hundred and twentyfive acres how did you father get possession of it there was a man he took care of in his sickness who gave it to him out of gratitude robert ferguson shrugged his shoulders it would have been better if he had given him the same number of dollars he said then you dont think it worth as much as that no i dont fred looked disappointed in their darkest days he and his mother had always thought of this land as likely some time to bring them handsomely out of their troubles and make a modest provision for their comfort now there seemed to be an end to this hope i would have sent your mother word before said robert ferguson but as the news was bad i thought it would keep i dont see what possessed your father to go out to colorado he was doing poorly here and some one recommended him to try his chances at the west well he did a foolish thing if a man improves his opportunities here he neednt wander away from home to earn a living thats my view then said fred slowly you dont think the land of any value no i dont of course i am sorry for your disappointment and i am going to show it let your mother make over to me all claim to this land and i will give her twentyfive dollars that isnt much said fred soberly no it isnt much but its better than nothing and i shall lose by my bargain fred sat in silence thinking over this proposal the land was the only property his poor father had left and to sell it for twentyfive dollars seemed like parting with a birthright for a mess of pottage on the other hand twentyfive dollars would be of great service to them under present circumstances i dont know what to say he answered slowly oh well it is your lookout i only made the offer as a personal favor mr ferguson resumed the perusal of his paper and thus implied that the interview was over cousin ferguson said fred with an effort our rent is due today and we are a little short of the money to meet it could you lend me three dollars till saturday night no answered robert ferguson coldly i dont approve of borrowing money as a matter of principle i decline to lend but if your mother agrees to sell the land she shall have twentyfive dollars at once fred rose with a heavy heart i will tell mother what you propose he said good evening good evening rejoined mr ferguson without raising his eyes from the paper twentyfive dollars would be very acceptable just now said mrs fenton thoughtfully when fred reported the offer of his rich relative but it wouldnt last long mother it would do us good while it lasted you are right there mother but i have no doubt the land is worth a good deal more what makes you think so cousin ferguson wouldnt have made the offer he did if he hadnt thought so too he might have done it to help us he isnt that kind of a man no mother it is for our interest to hold on to the land till we know more about it how shall we manage about the rent fred looked troubled something may turn up tomorrow when the landlord comes ask him to come again at eight oclock when i shall be home very well fred mrs fenton was so much in the habit of trusting to her son that she dismissed the matter with less anxiety than fred felt he knew very well that trusting for something to turn up is a precarious dependence but there seemed nothing better to do chapter iv zebulon mack at twelve that day the landlord zebulon mack presented himself promptly at the door of mrs fentons room he was a small thin wrinkled man whose suit would have been refused as a gift by the average tramp yet he had an income of four thousand dollars a year from rents he was now sixty years of age at twentyone he was working for eight dollars a week and saving threefifths of that by slow degrees he had made himself rich but in so doing he had denied himself all but the barest necessaries what he expected to do with his money as he was a bachelor with no near relatives was a mystery and he had probably formed no definite ideas himself but it was his great enjoyment to see his hoards annually increasing and he had no mercy for needy or unfortunate tenants who found themselves unable to pay their rent promptly mrs fenton opened the door with a troubled look ive come for that other three dollars maam said zebulon mack standing on the threshold im very sorry sir began the widow what havent you got the money snarled mack screwing up his features into a frown that made him look even more unprepossessing my son fred will be paid on saturday night and then saturday night wont do didnt you promise it today yes and fred tried to get an advance but could not where is he working on the erie road most likely he spends all his money for beer and cigarettes i know him he looks like it you are very much mistaken sir said mrs fenton indignantly oh you think so of course sneered the landlord mothers dont know much about their boys nor fathers either i am glad i havent a son i wouldnt be your son for a million dollars said little albert who resented the allusion to his big brother hey snarled mack opening his mouth and showing his tobaccostained tusks what business has a whippersnapper like you to put in your oar i aint a whippersnapper retorted albert who did not know the meaning of the word but concluded that it was not complimentary well maam what are you going to do i cant stay here all day fred thought he would have the money by tonight he asked if you would call round after he got home when is that he generally gets home at seven oclock then ill be here at seven but if you havent the money then out you go do you hear yes sir then mind you remember it with so many swindling tenants a landlord has a hard time he shambled off and mrs fenton breathed a sigh of temporary relief all the afternoon she felt troubled and anxious and her anxiety increased as the hours wore away if fred should be late as he sometimes is she said to bertie about six oclock i am afraid mr mack will carry out his threat and turn us out on the street i wont let him said albert manfully we cant help it said mrs fenton do you think you could find your way to the depot to meet fred and hurry him home oh yes answered the little boy i went there with fred last week you are sure you wont get lost what do you take me for mother id be ashamed to get lost anywhere round the city then go and tell fred to hurry up mr mack is so strict and severe that i am sure he wont wait a minute at seven oclock precisely mr mack returned and looking at his watch said times up maam wait just a few minutes pleaded mrs fenton i expect fred home every minute my times valuable maam it is not likely the boy will have the money any way wont you wait then do you take me for a fool maam here finnegan he had brought with him a man in his employ who for starvation wages helped him move out tenants and made himself useful in a general way here i am mr mack said finnegan just give me a hand with this bureau well take that first oh sir pleaded mrs fenton how can you be so merciless in a few minutes fred will be here im not a fool maam i told you id move you at seven oclock and im a man of my word wait a minute and ill see if i can borrow the money of mrs sheehan you ought to have thought of that before ill give you two minutes mrs fenton sped down lo the rooms of mrs sheehan on the next lower floor can you lend me three dollars mrs sheehan asked mrs fenton breathless mr mack threatens to turn us out on the sidewalk i wish i could mrs fenton said mrs sheehan heartily but i bought my john a suit yesterday and its taken all my money except seventyfive cents id be glad to oblige you indeed i would ive no doubt of it sighed the widow for it was her last hope well have you got the money asked zebulon mack as she reappeared no sir just what i thought go ahead finnegan they took up the bureau and slowly moved to the door and down the staircase with it its a shame said mrs sheehan standing at her door youd better look out maam it may be your turn next said the landlord with a scowl if it is i wont wait for you a minute its a hard man you are mr mack i need to be said zebulon mack grimly if i wasnt its precious little rent id get in the outlook for the fentons was dark indeed chapter v an adventure on the train fred was on board his regular train that same morning at the usual hour and started on his round of duty he sold four morning papers but trade seemed rather dull about eleven oclock he went through the first car distributing some packages of candy to the various passengers on reaching the end of the car he returned collecting the money for those purchased and reclaiming those not wanted about midway of the car was a man of middle age with small insignificant features and a mean look he seemed very much absorbed in reading a penny paper when the train boy came up will you buy the package of candy asked fred what package asked the passenger looking up the one i left with you when i passed through the car i dont know what you mean you left no package with me i remember distinctly leaving you a package you are thinking of some other man no i am not you are mistaken said the passenger frowning will you be kind enough to get up and let me see if it is on the seat or has fallen underneath no i wont fred was convinced that the passenger had secreted the package and was scheming to cheat him out of the dime he was a boy of spirit and he did not propose to be swindled sir he said in a louder tone i am a poor boy trying to earn an honest living if you dont pay for this package i shall have to that is none of my business i shall not pay for what i havent got boy you are very impertinent i shall report you to the president of the road you may do so if you want to i cant afford to give away my stock in trade boy interposed a pompous gentleman sitting opposite i quite agree with this gentleman you are not employed to insult passengers or to be cheated by them said fred hotly if you treated me in this way i would make it my business to have you discharged even if i was right of course you are not right this gentlemans word outweighs yours why should it he is a respectable gentleman and you are only a poor train boy that may be sir but i always tell the truth like george washington sneered the stout gentleman fred felt that he was losing his case and the mean passenger smiled with satisfaction but his triumph was shortlived the train boy found an unexpected defender the boy is right said a young lady sitting directly behind the passenger with whom fred had his difficulty i saw this man take the package and put it in his pocket i have waited with some curiosity to see whether he would persist in his attempt to cheat the boy out of his money there was an instant revulsion of feeling the attempted swindler looked as if a bombshell had exploded at his feet there is some error he stammered the young lady is mistaken i am not mistaken said the young lady positively if this man will allow his pockets to be examined the package will be found the man rose from his seat and prepared to leave the car i aint used to being insulted he said gentlemen said the young lady you have only to look at this mans sidepocket to see that it contains the package the passenger wore a sack coat and it was plain to all that the young lady was right i will pay for the package if the passenger is not honest enough to do it himself no miss said a roughlooking man who looked like a western miner this man must pay or ill pitch him out of the car myself i think you had better pay sir said the pompous looking man with an air of disgust i took your part because i supposed you were a gentleman the other without a word drew out a dime from his pocket and handed it to fred then looking very ill at ease he left the car hurriedly and went as far forward as possible do you have many experiences like this asked the young lady with a smile yes miss quite frequently aid fred and it isnt the poor passengers that try to cheat me sometimes i travel on emigrant trains but i never lost a cent by an emigrant it is those who are able to pay like this man who try to take advantage of me do you make good pay i average about a dollar a day i suppose that is fair pay for a boy of your age yes it is but i need it all i have a mother and brother to support have you indeed said the young lady sympathetically you cant all three live on six dollars a week mother earns a little by sewing but that isnt paid very well very true so you sometimes get into difficulties we are in difficulties now the rent is due and we lack three dollars to make it up that is easily remedied said the young lady it is my birthday today and i shall allow myself the luxury of doing good here are five dollars which you will use to pay the landlord thank you miss said fred gladly you have lifted a weight from my mind our landlord is a strict man and i was afraid we would be turned out on the street miss will you let me shake hands with you youre a trump it was the western miner who spoke and he had come forward impulsively from his seat and was extending a rough sunburned hand to the young lady she did not hesitate a moment but with a pleasant smile placed her hand in his i wish all hightoned gals was like you miss said the miner as he shook her hand heartily i am sure you would do the same sir said isabel archer yes i would and i meant to if you hadnt got the start of me youll excuse the liberty i took said the miner oh yes certainly im a rough miner but you are a kindhearted man you may hereafter have it in your power to help the boy so i can and the miner retreated to his seat arrived at the erie depot fred found his little brother waiting for him oh fred he said i hope youve got money for the rent the landlord said he would turn us out at seven oclock if we didnt pay and i am a little late said fred anxiously let me go with you said the miner i want to see what sort of a critter your landlord is the mean scoundrel it would do me good to shake him out of his boots zebulon mack and his assistant had just succeeded in placing the bureau on the sidewalk when fred and his mining friend turned the corner of the street theres mothers bureau exclaimed fred in excitement hes begun to move us out he has hey said sloan the miner well soon stop that what are you doing here demanded fred hurrying up zebulon mack turned round and eyed the boy with an ugly frown i told your mother id move her out and ive done it why didnt you wait for me ive got the money you have yes i have pay it over then fred was about to do so when the miner interposed dont pay him till he carries back the bureau said sloan you and your friend can do that said the landlord if you dont catch hold of that bureau and take it back ill wring your neck you mean scoundrel said the miner sternly zebulon mack looked into the miners face and thought it wisest to obey here finnegan he said sullenly take hold and dont be all night about it when the bureau was in place fred who had changed the fivedollar bill handed mr mack the three dollars now my friend said the miner you can reckon up how much you made by your meanness you and that understrapper of yours must enjoy moving bureaus i only wish youd got down the rest of the furniture so that i might have the satisfaction of seeing you carry it back the landlord glared at tom sloan as if he would like to tear him to pieces but he took it out in looks good night sir said the miner we dont care to have the pleasure of your company any longer ill be even with you for all this growled mack dont feel bad squire youve got your money mother said fred this is my friend mr sloan i am glad to see any friend of my boy said mrs fenton wont you stay and take supper with fred id like to maam if it wont be intruding not at all said fred cordially ive had luck today mother a beautiful young lady gave me five dollars god bless her said mrs fenton she couldnt have given it at a better time chapter vi mr bascoms peril tom sloan made himself very much at home with the fentons the widow sent out for a steak and this with a cup of tea and some fresh rolls furnished a plain but excellent repast i havent eaten so good a supper for a long time said the miner it seems just like the suppers i used to get at home in vermont it was very plain said mrs fenton but probably you had a good appetite you are right there maam mr sloan remained chatting for a couple of hours he told his new friends that he had been away two years spending the time in nevada and california i hope you have had good luck mr sloan said fred yes ive made a few thousand dollars but im going back again next month to california no to colorado fred and his mother exchanged looks my father left us some land in colorado said the train boy a hundred and twentyfive acres but we cant find out whether it has any value or not let me know where it is said the miner and ill find out and send you word thank you it will be a great favor said mrs fenton warmly a cousin of my husband went out there three months since and visited the land he reports that it is of no value but offers to buy it for twentyfive dollars fred thinks he wouldnt make the offer if it was not worth a good deal more thats where freds head is level depend upon it your cousin is foxy and wants to take you in ill tell you just how the matter stands mrs fenton produced her husbands papers and mr sloan made an entry of the location in a small notebook which he carried dont worry about it any more maam he said ill do all i can for you and i hope for your sake theres a gold mine on the land mrs fenton smiled i shall be satisfied with less than that she answered how long are you going to stay in new york asked fred i am going to vermont tomorrow and likely as not i shant come back this way but go west from boston anyway youll hear from me occasionally i aint much of a writer but i guess you can make out my pothooks ill take the risk mr sloan said fred i am no writing master myself but my little brother albert can draw nicely and writes a handsome hand bertie bring your last writingbook the little boy did so and exhibited it to the miner why the kid beats my old teacher all hollow said sloan ive a great mind to take him with me to vermont and have him start a writing school im afraid albert couldnt keep order among the big boys well there might be some trouble that way how much do you weigh kid ninety pounds answered albert well that isnt exactly a heavy weight but fred i must be going out and finding a room somewhere do you know of any good place theres a hotel close by ill go with you good evening maam said the miner as he rose to go i may not see you again just at present but ill look after that business of yourn come here kid you ought to get a prize for your writing heres something for you and he handed the delighted boy a fivedollar gold piece oh ma now may i have a new suit asked albert if you want a new suit said the miner i havent given you enough heres another five to help along you are very kind sir said mrs fenton albert is really in need of clothes and this will buy him something more than a suit all the better maam im glad to have the chance of doing a little good with my money i wish all who have money were like you i wish you health and good fortune and a safe return to your friends those are three good things maam if i get there i wont kick do you ever kick asked albert puzzled i see you dont understand me kid its a slang term we miners use i wont complain thats a little better english isnt it fred conducted mr sloan to the hotel nearby and saw him secure a good room then he was about to retire hold on a minute said the miner come up to my room i want to talk a little to you on business certainly mr sloan reaching the chamber the miner unbuckled a belt that spanned his waist and drew therefrom a large sum in gold pieces he counted out five double eagles a hundred dollars and turning to fred said i want you to keep that money for me till i come back but mr sloan said fred surprised why not leave it with your other money i might lose it i want you to put it in some savings bank in your own name and if you need it to draw out any part of it i dont want that mean scamp the landlord to get a chance to turn you out into the street but i might not be able to pay it back mr sloan ill take the risk i lend it to you without interest for a year and if you have to use any of it i wont sue you you are very kind it will make me feel much more easy in mind i wouldnt mind being turned into the street on my own account but mother couldnt stand it just so fred youve got a good mother and you must look out for her i dont often meet a good friend like you mr sloan oh pshaw you mustnt make too much of a little thing said the miner modestly im only giving you the interest on a hundred dollars fred walked slowly homeward feeling very cheerful he hoped he should not need to use any of mr sloans kind loan but it gave him a feeling of relief to know that he had a fund to draw from in case of need on his way home in passing a drinking saloon freds attention was drawn to two men who came out arm in arm both of whom appeared to be under the influence of liquor something in the dress and figure of one looked familiar coming closer fred recognized his country friend joshua bascom what mr bascom is this you why its fred said bascom stopping short and trying to stand erect oh come along said his companion impatiently no i want to see the train boy good night old fellow the other angrily protested against being shaken off but joshua dropped his arm and took freds instead how came you with that man asked fred hes a jolly sociable chap wanted to take me to a little card party but i guess its too late did he meet you in the saloon no he took me in there and treated me to three glasses of milk punch i guess its got into my head do you think i am intoxicated fred it looks very much like it mr bascom i hope they wont hear of it at home dad would get the minister to come and give me a talkin to i hope this stranger didnt get any of your money no he wouldnt let me pay for a thing he meant to get the money back he was carrying you to some gambling house where he would have won all your money you dont say exclaimed joshua panicstricken i thought he was a nice fellow be careful how you trust strangers and dont go to any more drinking saloons i wont said mr bascom fervently i will take you to your room and you had better take a good long sleep if you want to go round ill call tomorrow evening and go to some place of amusement with you i think mr bascom had better go back to his farm soon thought fred as he returned from piloting joshua home if he doesnt he is likely to get into trouble chapter vii ferdinand morris when ferdinand morris left the train after robbing joshua bascom as described in the first chapter he was in excellent spirits he had effected his purpose and got off scot free he walked briskly away from the station at which he got out and didnt stop to examine the wallet till he had got half a mile away when he discovered that it contained only ten dollars he was filled with disgust what could the fellow mean by coming to the city with only ten dollars in his pocketbook he muttered its a regular imposition it wasnt worth taking here i am stranded in the country and my ticket of no value for only ten dollars i should like to see my rural friends wobegone look when he discovers the loss of his wallet though this thought helped to reconcile morris to the situation the picture which he had conjured up tickled his fancy and he laughed heartily but his merriment was shortlived incidentally he noticed the loss of the ring and his countenance changed my ring gone he exclaimed what can have become of it it was worth fifty dollars at least i must have dropped it into that fellows pocket when i took his wallet thats a pretty bad exchange what an unlucky chap i am i am about forty dollars out of pocket the satisfaction of mr morris was quite destroyed there seemed little hope of his recovering the ring for he could not make known its loss without betraying himself i may as well be going back to new york he said moodily if i meet that fellow again i must get up some scheme for recovering the ring from him he is a countryman and i can frighten him into giving it to me the worst of it is the ring is not mine and the owner will make a fuss about it she is inclined to be suspicious and i shall find it hard work to explain in a house on lexington avenue lived a maiden lady close upon forty years of age though she called herself thirtyone miss josephine harden had been left independent through the will of an aunt who had left her the sum of thirtyfive thousand dollars she had been for eight years an humble attendant subject to the numerous whims and caprices of her relative but two years since had been repaid by a legacy ever since miss marden had been looking about for a suitable matrimonial partner there were some difficulties in the way for she was thin longnosed and with a yellow complexion three impecunious bachelors lured by her money had paid her some attentions but their courage failed at last and they silently slunk away at length however ferdinand morris met miss harden and conceived the idea of marrying her for her money when he had once got possession of her fortune he proposed to leave her in the lurch morris was a stylishlooking man and the spinster received his attentions very favorably she knew very little about him except that he was in some mysterious business about which he did not speak definitely except that it required him to travel constantly matters progressed until they became engaged at this point rather reversing the usual order of things miss marden gave her suitor the ring which he had now lost if we dont marry she said cautiously i shall expect you to give it back certainly my dear josephine said morris but i shall hold you to your promise you might see some girl younger and fair said hiss marden coyly how could that be said morris with mock ardor as he bent over her hand and kissed it with secret facial contortions do you doubt my love i try not to ferdinand but i am no longer in my first youth i shudder to say it i am twenty nine you were two years older last week thought morris i i dont feel so old said the spinster but i am afraid it is a fact i dont believe you will ever be forty again thought morris by the way josephine have you thought of that investment i spoke to you about i can get a hundred shares of mining stock for you at five dollars a share the inside price while to the general public it is only sold at ten it may be as you say ferdinand but my aunt lost money in mining stocks and i shall hardly dare to venture confound your aunt said morris to himself i assure you josephine this is a chance to double your money in three months have you invested in it yourself ferdinand oh yes answered morris glibly i have a hundred and fifty shares suspicious as she was miss morris believed her suitor to be a man of means and did not doubt his statement then i hope for your sake it will prove a good investment confound her thought morris there seems no chance to make her open her purse strings she has got to come down liberally or i wont marry her it was at miss mardens door that ferdinand morris rang on the evening after the loss of the ring he would have kept away but he had promised to call and miss morris was very strict in requiring him to keep his engagements he had hardly entered the room when she discovered the loss of the ring what has become of the ring ferdinand she asked quickly i thought you would miss it he replied in some confusion where is it i asked miss harden peremptorily plague take the old cat thought morris i suppose i may as well tell the truth the fact is he stammered it was stolen from me on an erie train today by a pickpocket and you let him do it what could you be thinking of ferdinand you have no idea how expert these fellows are josephine said morris who certainly ought to know i think a man must be inexcusably careless or simple returned the spinster to allow a man to steal a ring from his finger do you suspect anybody yes i sat beside a young man dressed up as a countryman he was such a good imitation that i was positively taken in he looked as if he had been driving the plow all his life and he stole the ring he must have done it there was no one else near who had the chance but how could he slip it off your finger without your knowing it the fact is i fell into a doze and when i was half asleep the ring was taken after he had got it he got out at some station and i am afraid i never shall see him again i am not satisfied with your explanation ferdinand you dont mean to say you doubt my word josephine i paid fifty dollars for that ring at a jewelers on sixth avenue and i dont feel like losing so much money but it is my loss as you gave it to me you forget that in case our engagement was broken it was to be returned but you really dont think of breaking the engagement you dont want to drive me to despair do you really love me so much ferdinand said the spinster smiling complacently can you doubt it it makes me very unhappy to have you find fault with me but you must admit that you were very careless i confess it but the man looked so innocent do you think you shall ever meet him again i think so he may be in another disguise i will give you four weeks to do so ferdinand if you dont succeed i shall require you to buy another in its place i will do my best said morris i really thought you were sharper ferdinand no pickpocket could rob me i may try it some time thought morris it would be rather a satisfaction to do it too i wonder if i shall meet that country fellow again thought morris as he left the house if i do ill see if i cant frighten him into returning my ring the very next evening in passing the standard theater near the corner of thirtythird street morris saw and instantly recognized the tall rustic figure and slouching walk of joshua bascom he paused a moment in indecision then summoning up all his native bravado he stepped forward and laid his hand on joshuas shoulder look here my friend he said in tone of authority i have some business with you chapter viii mr bascoms sad plight joshua turned in alarm fearing that he was in the hands of a policeman what have i done he began then recognizing morris he said why its the man who stole my wallet you must be crazy rejoined morris i charge you with theft well that beats all ejaculated joshua just give me back my ten dollars i admire your cheek my friend said morris but it wont go down where is that ring you stole from my finger you left it in my pocket when you put in your hand and stole my wallet ha you confess that you have got it where is it give me back my wallet and i may tell you my rural friend you are in great danger do you see that policeman coming up the street well i propose to give you in charge unless you give me back my ring i havent got it said joshua beginning to feel uneasy then give me fifty dollars the sum i paid for it gosh all hemlock exclaimed joshua impatiently you talk as if i was a thief instead of you so you are its a lie of course you say so if you havent fifty dollars give me all you have and ill let you off i wont do it then you must take the consequences here policeman i give this man in charge for stealing a valuable ring from me when did he do it just now yes answered morris with unexpected audacity he looks like a countryman but he is a crook in disguise come along my man said the policeman taking joshua in tow you must come with me i haint done nothing said joshua please let me go mr policeman thats what they all say remarked morris shrugging his shoulders i see hes an old offender said the intelligent policeman who had only been on the force three months hes one of the most artful crooks i ever met said morris youd swear he was a countryman so i be insisted joshua i came from barton up elmira way and ive never been in the city before hear him said morris laughing heartily ask him his name my names joshua bascom and i go to the baptist church reglar just write and ask parson peabody and hell tell you im perfectly respectable my friend said morris you cant fool an experienced officer by any such rigmarole he can read you like a book of course i can said the policeman who felt the more flattered by this tribute because he was really a novice as this gentleman says i knew you to be a crook the moment i set eyes on you they turned the corner of thirtieth street on their way to the station house poor joshua felt keenly the humiliation and disgrace of his position it would be in all the papers he had no doubt for all such items got into the home papers and he would not dare show his face in barton again am i going to jail he asked with keen anguish youll land there shortly said morris but i haint done a thing is it necessary for me to go in asked ferdinand morris with considerable uneasiness for he feared to be recognized by some older member of the force certainly replied the policeman you must enter a complaint against this man morris peered into the station house but saw no officer likely to remember him so he summoned up all his audacity and followed the policeman and his prisoner inside there happened to be no other case ahead so joshua was brought forward what has this man done asked the sergeant stolen a ring from this gentleman here answered the policeman was the ring found on his person no sergeant he has not been searched search me if you want to you wont find anything said joshua he has probably thrown it away said ferdinand morris sotto voce no i haint what is your name sir asked the sergeant addressing morris my name is clarence hale answered morris boldly taking the name of a young man of respectable family whom he had met casually where do you live on fourth avenue sir near eleventh street do you swear that this man stole your ring yes sir where in front of the standard theater how could he do it continued the sergeant he could not take it from your hand it was in my pocket i found him with his hand in my pocket answered morris glibly by gracious ejaculated joshua his eyes distended with amazement i never heard a fellow lie so slick before in all my life silence said the sergeant mr hale will you appear tomorrow morning at jefferson market and testify against this man yes sir officer have you ever arrested this man before went on the sergeant im not quite sure sir you see hes in disguise now i think hes wan of the gang things began to look bad for poor joshua who was in a fair way to be railroaded to the penitentiary as no doubt more than one innocent man has been before now through an unfortunate complication i wish i had some friend to speak up for me he said almost sobbing this is awful so you have said an unexpected voice joshua turned and to his inexpressible relief saw fred standing on the threshold its the train boy he exclaimed joyfully fred had set out to call upon joshua that evening and had chanced to see him going into the station house with the confidence man he had followed to find out what it meant there was one who was not so well pleased to see him ferdinand morris turned pale and tried to make his escape excuse me he said i am faint and must get out into the air but fred stood in his way not so fast mr ferdinand morris he said what trick are you up to now do you know this man fred asked the sergeant who had known the train boy for three years for he lived only one block away on the same street yes sir he stole the wallet of this young man on my train on the erie less than a week since but he said the prisoner stole his ring he left the ring in mr bascoms pocket when he was feeling for the wallet this is a great mistake said morris hurriedly i never saw this train boy before and havent traveled on the erie road for a year this man is telling a falsehood said fred will you swear that he was on your train and robbed this countryman asked the sergeant yes sir is there any officer who recognizes him the sergeant inquired looking round the room i do answered a stout policeman who just then entered the station house i arrested him six months since but he managed to slip away the prisoner is discharged said the sergeant hold the complainant instead to his great joy joshua was set free and mr morris alias hale was collared by a policeman though he made a desperate struggle to escape ill get even with you boy said morris savagely addressing fred come along mr bascom said fred i presume you dont care to stay here any longer not if i know it said joshua fervently if i live till tomorrow morning ill start back to barton ive seen all i want to of york i wont feel safe till i get home in sight of the old meetin house i wouldnt have dad know id been arrested for a load of pumpkins chapter ix a long trip fred appeared at the depot the next morning the superintendent said to him i shall have to change your train today you will wait for the nine oclock train for suspension bridge when shall i get there the superintendent referring to his schedule of trains answered at tonight the boy who usually goes on this train is sick when shall i return let me see it is saturday if you would like to stay over a day and see niagara falls you can do so and start on your return monday morning at how do you like the arrangement very much i was only thinking how i could get word to my mother she will feel anxious if i am not back at the usual time you might send her a note by a telegraph messenger at this moment fred espied a boy of his acquaintance in the street outside here charlie schaeffer he called do you want to earn a quarter yes answered the boy quickly what do you want me to do take a note to my mother itll cost me almost a quarter for expenses i will pay that besides all right give me the letter fred scribbled these few lines dear mother i am sent to suspension bridge and shall not probably be back till late monday evening or perhaps tuesday morning dont worry fred charlie schaeffer a stout german boy who was temporarily out of work was glad of the chance of earning a quarter for himself and started at once on his errand fred quite elated at the prospect of seeing niagara falls prepared for his trip he had to carry a larger supply of stock on account of the length of the journey and was instructed to lay in a fresh supply at buffalo for the home trip he was about to enter the car at ten minutes of nine when joshua bascom appeared on the platform with a wellworn carpetbag in his hand are you going back mr bascom asked the train boy yes answered joshua i dont want to go to no more station houses i shant rest easy til im back in barton you haint seen any policeman lookin for me have you no you havent done anything wrong have you not as i know of but them cops is very meddlesome i thought that pickpocket might have set em on my track you are safe here this is new jersey and a new york policeman cant arrest you here thats good said joshua with an air of relief where are you going today im going all the way with you you aint goin as far as barton yes i am and farther too im going to niagara you dont say and you dont have to pay a cent either no i get paid for going i wish i was goin to niagara with you by hokey wouldnt the folks stare if i was to come home and tell em id seen the falls cant you go no ive spent all the money i can afford i must wait till next year did you spend all of your money mr bascom no chuckled joshua ive only spent the fifteen dollars i got for that ring and shall carry home the ten dollars you are an able financier mr bascom youve made your expenses and can afford to go again you must tell your father how you got the best of a pickpocket so i will i guess hell think im smarter than he reckoned for at about halfpast four in the afternoon fred was called upon to bid his country friend goodby looking from the door of the car he saw joshua climb into a hay wagon driven by an elderly man whose appearance led him to conclude that he was the dad to whom joshua had frequently referred the sun sank the darkness came on but still the train sped swiftly over its iron pathway the passengers settled back in their seats some fell asleep and the hum of conversation ceased fred too gave up his trips through the cars and stretching himself out on a seat closed his eyes presently the train came to a stop and the conductor putting in his head at the door called out niagara falls fred rose hastily for he had made up his mind to get out at this point he descended from the train and found himself on the platform of the station he had already selected the hotel a small one where the rate was very moderate and as there was no carriage representing it at the train he set out to walk it was a small plainlooking inn of perhaps thirty rooms named after the proprietor the lynch house on the road thither he was overtaken by a stranger whom he remembered as one of the passengers on the second car he appeared to be about forty years of age and though it was a warm summer evening he was muffled up about the neck are you going to stop here over night he asked yes sir you are the train boy are you not yes sir what hotel shall you put up at one recommended to me by the conductor the lynch house i think i will stop there too you may not like it it is a small cheap house it doesnt matter i am well provided with money but i dont care for style or fashion i am an invalid and i prefer the quiet of a small hotel there will be less noise and confusion very well sir i think that is the hotel yonder such proved to be the case it was large on the ground but only three stories in height over the portico was a sign bearing the name it was by no means fashionable in its appearance but looked comfortable fred and the stranger entered a sleepylooking clerk sat behind the desk he opened his eyes and surveyed the late comers can you give me a room asked fred i would like one too said the other weve only got one room left said the clerk thats a back room on the second story are you gentlemen in company no answered fred we are strangers to each other then i cant give but one of you a room if you dont mind rooming together you can both be accommodated are there two beds in a room asked the stranger yes then i dont object to occupying it with this young man he is a stranger to me but i watched him on board the train and i am sure he is all right thank you sir said fred well said the clerk what does the boy say fred looked curiously at his companion he was so muffled up that he could only see a pair of black eyes a long sallow nose and cheeks covered with dark whiskers the train boy did not fancy his looks much but could think of no good reason for declining him as a room companion he felt that the gentleman had paid him a compliment in offering to room with him particularly when as he stated he had a considerable amount of money about him he paused a moment only before he said perhaps we may as well room together then all right i will go up with you as the hall boy has gone to bed i hardly expected any guests by this late train the clerk took the strangers valise fred had only a small paper parcel in his hand containing a clean shirt and a collar which he had bought in jersey city before taking passage on the train up one flight of stairs the clerk preceded them and paused in front of no the back room referred to he unlocked the door and entering lighted the gas it was a room about twelve feet wide by twenty in depth at each end was a single bedstead i think you will be comfortable said the clerk is there anything you want before retiring no answered both chapter x what took place in no the clerk closed the door leaving fred alone with the stranger the latter sat down in one of the two chairs with which the room was provided i am not sleepy he said are you yes answered fred gaping i am not used to late hours besides i was up early this morning that makes a difference i didnt get up till eleven i was about to propose a game of cards i dont care for playing cards said fred besides i am sleepy all right you wont object to my sitting up awhile and reading fred would have preferred to have his companion go to bed as he was not used to sleep with a light burning he did not wish to be disobliging however and answered that he didnt mind the stranger took from his handbag a papercovered novel and seating himself near the gas jet began to read fred undressed himself and lay down he remembered with a little uneasiness that he had with him the hundred dollars in gold which had been intrusted to him by the miner he had had no opportunity as yet to deposit it in the union dime savings bank as he had decided to do and had not thought to leave it with his mother he wished now that he had done so for he was about to pass several hours in the company of a man whom he knew nothing about still the man had plenty of money of his own or at least he had said so and was not likely therefore to be tempted to steal fred took his place in bed and looked over toward the stranger with some uneasiness are you a good sleeper asked his companion carelessly yes answered fred so am i i dont feel sleepy just at present but presume i shall within twenty minutes i hope i dont inconvenience you by sitting up no answered fred slowly ive got my book nearly finished i began to read it on the train when do you expect to go back monday morning fred answered thats good we will go and see the falls together tomorrow ever seen them no sir this is my first visit to niagara i have been here several times so i know the ropes i shall be glad to show you just where to go but pardon me i see you are sleepy i wont say another word good night and pleasant dreams good night the stranger continued to read for twenty minutes at any rate he appeared to do so occasionally he glanced over toward freds bed the train boy meant to keep awake till his companion got ready to go to bed but he was naturally a good sleeper and his eyes would close in spite of him and finally he gave up all hope of resistance and yielded to the inevitable soon his deep regular breathing showed that he was unconscious of what was passing around him the stranger rose walked cautiously to the bed and surveyed the sleeping boy how peacefully he sleeps he said he has nothing on his conscience at his age it was the same with me i started right but circumstances have been too much for me there wont be much sleep for me tonight for the detectives are doubtless on my track i must get rid of one damaging piece of evidence he opened his valise and after searching a little drew therefrom a massive gold watch rather oldfashioned in appearance attached to a solid gold chain neither was new and both had evidently been used for a considerable number of years i was a fool to take these said the stranger they are more likely to fasten suspicion on me than anything else however i have a good chance now to get rid of them fred had laid his newspaper parcel on a small table near his bed the other carefully untied the twine with which he had fastened it and putting the watch and chain inside the shirt he carefully wrapped it up again and tied it with the same cord the boy will be considerably surprised he opens his bundle and discovers these he reflected with a smile he will be a little puzzled to know how they came there well that is none of my business selfpreservation is the first law of nature and it is important i should get rid of such telltale clews this piece of business over the stranger stretched himself and took off his coat he was proceeding to undress when a sudden thought deterred him on the whole he said to himself i will go to bed as i am i may have occasion for a sudden start it is best to be on the safe side he laid his coat on the back of a chair and putting out the gas stretched himself on the bed he had not thought himself sleepy but a recumbent position brought on a drowsy feeling and before he was well aware of it he had sunk to sleep but his slumber was not as sound or restful as the train boys from time to time he uttered ejaculations as if he were terrorstricken and once he waked up with a cold perspiration on his brow it took a minute for him to realize his position what a fool i am he muttered in disgust i thought the police had nabbed me but alls safe so far if i could only get a little more sleep as sound and peaceful as that boy is enjoying i should wake revived in the morning there is no reason why i shouldnt they cant have got on my track so soon he closed his eyes and succeeded in dispelling the uneasy feeling which sprang from the consciousness of having exposed himself to the danger of arrest it was now three oclock in fifteen minutes he was sleeping again and this time his slumbers were less disturbed and uneasy he awoke suddenly to find the sun streaming into the room it must be late he thought a little nervously but on examining his watch he found that it was only six oclock i may as well get up he said to himself i shall be safer on the canada side i dont want to wake the boy for he might be tempted to get up with me besides if he opened his bundle the sight of the watch might arouse his suspicions and get me into trouble fortunately i did not undress and can be up and away in two minutes he put on his coat and descended to the office you are down early said the clerk in some surprise yes i want to see the falls and take an early train west how much is my bill he was told and laid the money on the desk the boy with you remains yes i suppose so the boy is no acquaintance of mine i only met him on the train there is something about that boy that excites my curiosity he added thoughtfully such as what asked the clerk his curiosity aroused he seems to have something on his mind his sleep was very much disturbed he moved about a good deal and muttered frequently but i could not make out any words perhaps he has run away from home suggested the clerk the stranger shrugged his shoulders he may have had good reasons for running away he said however that is none of my business i suppose you missed nothing during the night no good morning the stranger went out directing his steps toward the falls an hour later a quietlooking man entered the office good morning mr ferguson said the clerk what brings you here so early business answered the other briefly did you have any late arrivals last evening yes two who were they a man and boy are they here still the boy is upstairs the man left at six oclock he wanted to see the falls before taking an early train he said the boy seemed very nervous and had a troubled sleep the detective nodded i think he must be the party i want why what has happened the house of a wealthy old gentleman in elmira was entered yesterday afternoon and articles of value taken i received a telegram this morning which should have reached me last night asking me to be on the watch for any suspicious parties and you think the boy committed the burglary asked the clerk in excitement it looks like it with your permission i will go upstairs and take a look at him chapter xi fred falls under a terrible suspicion about ten minutes before the arrival of the detective fred woke up he generally awoke earlier but his long ride of the day before had fatigued him more than usual it was natural for him to glance over to the opposite bed occupied by his traveling companion he was surprised to find it empty he must have got up early thought fred i wonder if he has gone for good this seemed likely for the strangers valise had disappeared also i wonder he didnt wake me up and bid me goodby thought the train boy then a momentary suspicion led him to search for the hundred dollars in gold which he had carefully concealed in his inside vest pocket if that were taken he would be in a quandary for there would be little chance of his being able to make up the loss to his friend the western miner he found to his relief that the gold had not been touched and he reproached himself for the injustice he had in his thoughts done his late roommate well soliloquized fred as he lazily got out of bed and drew on his clothes i am not sorry to have the room alone if i could have a friend from home with me i should like it but i dont care for the company of a stranger fred reflected that he had all the day to himself he could hear the roar of the famous cataract which he had not yet seen on account of his late arrival the night before and he determined to go there immediately after breakfast or even before breakfast if he found that it was quite near he went to the window and looked out but it was not in sight i may as well put on a clean shirt thought fred and he went to the table to open the bundle which he had brought from jersey city he had just unfastened the string when a quick imperative knock was heard at the door of his room come in said fred with some surprise he turned his face to the door and his wonder increased as it opened and he saw the clerk and a stranger standing on the threshold they entered the room and closed the door behind them what is the matter asked the train boy has anything happened when did your roommate leave asked the detective not answering his question i dont know i only just woke up did you rest well thats a very queer question to ask me thought fred yes he answered i rested very well the detective and the clerk exchanged glances this statement did not accord with what freds roommate had said downstairs the bed was very comfortable added fred by way of compliment to the house i am glad you found it so said the detective dryly did you come upstairs to ask how i rested asked fred with a smile you are sharp my young friend said the detective and i think i may say wonderfully cool under the circumstances under what circumstances asked fred his attention drawn to the last part of the detectives speech there was a burglary committed yesterday afternoon in elmira said the detective fastening his eyes keenly on the face of the train boy was there asked fred not seeing in what way this information was likely to affect him i thought most burglaries were committed in the night they are generally but this was an exception there was no one in the house except old mr carver who is quite hard of hearing the burglary probably took place about five oclock and the burglar is supposed to have taken the train from elmira why that is the train i was on said fred in surprise by a curious coincidence said the detective with a queer smile it was by your train that the burglar probably traveled his tone was so significant that fred asked quickly what do you mean i mean my young friend said the detective that you are suspected to know something of this affair if you are a detective retorted fred i don think much of your sharpness i have never been in elmira in my life probably not said ferguson the detective with a provoking smile i passed through there yesterday on my way from new york with that exception i never saw the place that may be true said the detective cautiously or it may not i will take the liberty of examining your luggage to see if i can find any of the stolen articles you are welcome to do it said fred bring it out then where have you put it under the bed all the luggage i have is in this bundle said the train boy you can open that if you think it will do you any good you are sure you have no valise ferguson who like most of his class was suspicious peeped under each bed but found nothing to reward his search somewhat disappointed he went to the table and opened the newspaper bundle he did so listlessly not really expecting to find anything but as he unrolled freds shirt there was a triumphant look in his eyes when he uncovered the gold watch and chain just as i thought he said with a nod to the clerk what is that gasped fred it appears to be a watch and chain answered ferguson coolly possibly you can tell me how it came there i know nothing about it said fred in dire amazement you do not claim it as yours then certainly not i never saw it before in my life is this shirt yours yes you brought it with you yes let me open the watch do you see this inscription fred and the clerk approached and on the inside of the case read the name philo carver elmira you see this is one of the articles stolen from mr carvers house yesterday afternoon it is a little odd that this young man in whose bundle i find it cannot explain its presence you may believe me or not said fred desperately but it is true all the same i know nothing of this watch or chain and i never saw either before can you tell me what other articles were taken by the burglar some government bonds and a small sum of bank bills then you had better search for them also here i will help you all i can well you are a cool hand no i am innocent that is all it is pretty clear you have nothing else with you or you wouldnt be so willing however i consider it my duty to do as you suggest he hunted under the mattresses and finally examined freds pockets at last he felt in the inside vest pocket and drew out the gold coins ha we have something here he exclaimed yes answered fred but those happen to belong to me where did you get them from a friend in new york he intrusted them to me to use if i needed meanwhile i was to put them in the savings bank not a very likely story said the detective suspiciously likely or not it is a true story does this man carver claim to have lost any gold coins no i thought not however we come back to the inquiry where did you get the watch the man who slept in the room with me must have left it here to throw suspicion on me said fred with sudden inspiration that is possible said the clerk who was favorably impressed by freds manner we must not jump at conclusions said the detective warily i shall feel justified in detaining the boy after what i have found you wont take me to the station house said fred nervously no it will answer the purpose if you are locked up in this room for the present then said fred turning to the clerk i shall be much obliged if you will send me up some breakfast it shall be done within half an hour fred was discussing a beefsteak and fried potatoes with hearty enjoyment it takes a good deal to spoil the appetite of a healthy boy of seventeen chapter xii fred as a prisoner after breakfast fred became restless it was tantalizing to be so near the falls and yet to be locked up and prevented from seeing them of course it would all come right in time but it was hard to bear the suspense and confinement hunting round the room he found a juvenile book and sitting down at the window read it it helped to while away the time till twelve oclock he had scarcely read the last page when he heard the key turning in the lock outside the door opened and two persons appeared at the entrance one was the clerk the other a boy rather short with a bright attractive face i thought you might like company said the clerk in a friendly manner this is my young cousin frank hamblin who will remain with yon for a while i am glad to see you frank said fred offering his hand you are very kind to come and see a bold bad burglar you dont look much like it said frank laughing still appearances are deceitful i dont think i look wicked said fred meditatively as he glanced at his reflection in a small mirror that hung over the washstand yet it appears that i have broken into a gentlemans house in elmira and stolen a gold watch and chain and some government bonds how could you do it asked frank with much seriousness so young and yet so wicked thats the question that puzzles me said fred how could i do it when at the time the burglary was committed i was speeding over the erie road at the rate of thirty miles an hour can you prove this asked frank eagerly certainly i could if the conductor or brakeman of my car were here where are they probably on their way back to new york do you live there yes i have always wanted to see the city of new york it must be a gay place you are right there frank whenever you do come just inquire for fred fenton and i will show you round there is my address thank you i should like it ever so much have you ever been here before no i wanted very much to see the falls but here i am locked up in a hotel chamber i wish the falls were visible from the window they are on the other side of the house do you know this detective the one that searched me yes i have seen him i heard him tell my cousin that he did not believe you guilty but that finding the watch and chain in your bundle was a suspicious circumstance i suppose it is now i can understand how innocent people get into trouble do you live here no i am only visiting some friends here i live in auburn thats where the states prison is isnt it yes then i hope i shant go to auburn to live have you any idea how long i shall have to stay here till evening i suppose you will probably be brought before a justice in the morning was franks reply fred sighed how differently things have turned out from what i anticipated he said i expected to be walking round and looking at the falls today hold on a minute said frank mr ferguson boards here and he may be downstairs now ill ask him if you cant go out under my charge if youll promise not to run away ill promise that fast enough you can knock me down if i attempt to escape i am afraid i might find that difficult as you are at least two inches taller than i i will be very gentle and submissive i wouldnt be willing to run away with such a suspicion hanging over me excuse me a minute ill do what i can for you frank went to the door and attempted to open it but it was locked on the outside and resisted his efforts i forgot he said laughing that i am a prisoner too really it makes a fellow feel queer to be locked up thats the way i feel you can ring the bell cant you a good thought frank rang the bell and presently a hall boy opened the door about an inch and looked in is anything wanted he asked is mr ferguson downstairs said frank he has just come in wont you ask him to step up here a minute all right sir the door was relocked but two minutes later it was opened and the detective walked in ha he said so we have two burglars instead of one i am just as much a burglar as fred is said frank then said the detective with a smile i may feel it my duty to search you you do have rather a hardened expression do you think i have asked fred smiling well no i wouldnt pick you out for a professional criminal and to be honest with you i doubt whether you know anything of the burglary thank you i am glad you have a better opinion of me than that but what is it you want of me frank i want fred to have a chance to see the falls he has never been here before and it will be a great disappointment to him if he has to go away without seeing them to be sure to be sure said the detective thoughtfully i thought you might let him go out under my escort mr ferguson smiled what could you do if he took it into his head to escape you couldnt lend me a club could you i dont carry any that is for policemen and i have never acted in that capacity but he wont run away will you fred no i prefer to stay here till i am cleared of suspicion you see mr ferguson said frank eagerly there will be no risk about it he can give you his parole thats the word isnt it yes but this privilege is never accorded to those who are arrested for burglary it is certainly inconvenient to be a burglar said fred smiling in spite of his secret anxiety then you cant let him go questioned frank regretfully well there is one way i should not consider it safe to let him go with you but i might accompany you that will be capital you will wont you yes i will said ferguson after a momentary pause i have a boy of my own about the age of the young burglar and that perhaps inclines me to be more indulgent but you must wait till after dinner will dinner be sent up here asked frank yes for him but you are not staying at the house i forgot and i havent got money enough to pay for a hotel dinner thats all right frank said fred i invite you to dine with me and it shall be charged on my bill i shall enjoy dinner better if i have company thank you i accept the invitation but i dont like to be an expense to you never mind dinner was sent up in the course of half an hour and the two boys enjoyed it are you still attending school frank asked fred yes i should like to but poor boys like me have to work for a living if you wont tell i will let you into a secret what is it i am writing a long story i want to be an author some time ive written twenty chapters already you must be smart said fred in surprise why i couldnt write as much in a whole year of course i cant tell whether it is good for anything but some time i mean to write well well frank i wish you success i am sure some day i may be proud to know you now i might write a story about you and call it the boy burglar dont i have no wish to figure in that character half an hour later the door opened and the detective entered dressed for a walk now if you two burglars are ready he said we will take a stroll chapter xiii the hotel clerks mistake what was the name of your roommate fred asked frank hamblin as they went downstairs i didnt notice he registered before me suppose we look and see it may be well to know they opened the hotel register and saw written in a bold free hand f grant palmer chicago it may be another fred suggested frank or frank either name would do for a burglar said mr ferguson smiling but it is hardly consistent with professional etiquette to joke on such a subject i will endeavor to forget while we are walking together that one of the party is an offender against the laws or under suspicion as such i want to forget it myself said fred or it will spoil my enjoyment of niagara i wonder where mr f grant palmer is now said frank i feel sure he is the real burglar then he has probably gone over into canada returned fred it is unlucky for me that he left the watch and chain but lucky for mr carver who will now recover them meanwhile let us follow mr palmer whose movements are of interest to us in connection with the suspicion he has managed to throw on fred when he left the lynch house he proposed as a measure of safety to go over to the canada side and indeed he did so he made his way to the clifton house and registered there depositing his valise at the office while he went in to breakfast we have no room at present said the clerk politely but by the middle of the forenoon we shall undoubtedly have a few vacancies will that answer oh yes said palmer easily i am in no special hurry for a room but will take breakfast and go out for a walk it did occur to mr palmer that the valise containing as it did the bonds stolen from mr carver in elmira should be carefully guarded however it would surely be as safe in the care of the hotel clerk of the clifton as in any hotel room and probably even safer so he ate breakfast with an easy mind and then purchasing a cigar took a walk along the road which presents the best views of the falls mr palmer felt very complacent it is a blessing to gentlemen in my profession he soliloquized that canada is so conveniently near here the minions of the law cannot touch us for any little indiscretion committed under the stars and stripes i hear people talking of annexing canada to the states but to that i am unalterably opposed i should have to retire from business and i am not able to do that at present he was standing at a convenient point surveying the falls when he felt a light touch on his shoulder such was the force of habit that mr palmer started violently and turned round nervously it was a stout man with a smiling face that confronted him ha palmer said the new arrival did you mistake me for how are you wellington i am glad to see you instead of oh pshaw a man naturally starts when he is tapped on the shoulder unexpectedly i see you were admiring the falls yes there is a good deal of romance in your composition my dear palmer said his friend banteringly anything new well yes said palmer glancing around him cautiously made a strike eh well something of the sort what is it i managed to have a stroke of luck at elmira yesterday afternoon how much did you get away with hush dont speak so plainly suppose any one should hear you my dear fellow there is no one within two hundred yards well there must be five thousand dollars in bonds and money very neat upon my word you are in luck how about you i made a small raise at buffalo a paltry three hundred dollars worth it was hardly worth the trouble of taking still a man must live to be sure now with what you picked up you can live a year or two in comfort upon my soul i envy you are you suspected i have managed to divert suspicion i think and palmer told his friend the story of his secreting the gold watch and chain in freds luggage very shrewd said his friend approvingly palmer you are a credit to our profession i shall be content to take lessons of you oh you are only joking said palmer his expression showing however that he felt proud of the compliment they took a long and leisurely walk together talking over their mutual experiences they had known each other for ten years having been fellow boarders together as far back as that at sing sing since then neither had been caught though both had been engaged in violating the laws their similar professions had given them a common bond of sympathy and they found so much satisfaction in each others company that the time slipped by insensibly and it was halfpast twelve before they found their way back to the clifton mr palmer stepped up to the desk have you a room for me yet he inquired yes sir i can give you no here front a hall boy answered the summons take the gentleman up to said the clerk any luggage sir you may hand me my valise if you please beg pardon here it is come up with me wellington well continue our talk up stairs palmer merely glanced at the valise and continued talking with his friend the hall boy unlocked the door of no and led the way inside it was a pleasant room and palmer looked about him approvingly i shall be very comfortable here he said is everything right asked the hall boy lingering palmer smiled drew a quarter from his pocket and put it into the ready hand of the young man you take american coins dont you he asked with a smile oh dear yes sir thank you that is all for the present if i want anything i will ring wellington scanned the valise with an eye of interest so that holds the swag does it he asked my dear friend dont use such vulgar terms said palmer reproachfully its not only inelegant but its imprudent suppose anybody heard you your reproof is just palmer i am rather a blunderer i admit i see you are traveling under a false name what do you mean wellington pointed to a small card attached to the valise it bore the name of edmund lawrence when palmers glance fell on this card a quick glance of dismay swept over his face that isnt my valise he said not your valise no the clerk has made a mistake i must see him at once continued palmer in an agitated voice he may have given my valise to this man lawrence and in that case i am ruined stay here till i return palmer seized the satchel opened the door and descended to the office in breathless haste as he dashed up to the desk the clerk eyed him in mild surprise what is the matter he asked matter enough you have given me the wrong valise is it possible see here this belongs to a party named lawrence edmund lawrence give me mine at once the clerk looked troubled i am afraid i cant he faltered apologetically i gave mr lawrence your valise you will observe that they are very much alike and he carried it away two hours since palmer felt ready to drop to think that after all his careful planning everything should be jeopardized by a hotel clerks error do you know what you have done he said in a hollow voice my valise contained two thousand dollars worth of securities i am terribly sorry mr palmer but i dont think you will suffer any loss this mr lawrence looks like a hightoned gentleman you can see him within an hour he went from here to the international hotel on the american side of the falls i advise you to go over at once take his bag with you and exchange chapter xiv the missing valise that he was imprudent in trusting himself on the american side mr grant palmer was well aware but he felt that he was in danger of losing the entire proceeds of his skilful burglary and to this he could not make up his mind besides the danger was not very great why should any one suppose that an ordinary valise contained stolen property there was nothing remarkable about the appearance of his handbag hundreds of them are carried every day if it were opened by a dishonest person of course it would be doubtful if he ever got it back but the clerk at the clifton had said that this mr lawrence seemed like a hightoned gentleman who would of course scorn to avail himself of property not his own risk or no risk decided palmer i must go over and reclaim my property leaving him to cross to the american side we will follow mr lawrence who not at all suspecting that the valise he had received from the clerk was not his own repaired to the international hotel and engaged one of the best rooms in the house for he was a man of ample means he laid his valise on the bed and went downstairs later in the day he went out to take his customary walk meanwhile fred and his two companions walked about in a leisurely manner surveying the falls from different points and finally went to goat island here they sat down on a bench and surrendered themselves to the fascinations of the scene well what do you think of niagara fred asked frank it is even finer than i had supposed replied the train boy some people are disappointed said mr ferguson because they expect too much the falls of montmorency are considerably higher but not nearly as wide there are some cascades in the yosemite valley of over a thousand feet descent but they are only a few feet wide for grandeur niagara excels them all i shouldnt like to be swept over the falls said fred it must be terrible said frank with a shudder the reality is worse than any picture drawn by the imagination ten years since it happened to me to see a poor wretch drawn down to destruction over the cataract the boys looked eager for the story and he proceeded i may state continued the detective that i was indirectly the cause of the tragedy a defaulting bank cashier had got as far as this point on his way to canada which as now was a haven of refuge to gentlemen of his character i was close upon his track and he was in imminent danger of capture there seemed to be only one way of escape crossing the river above the falls by some means he obtained a rowboat and being a fair rower set out on his dangerous trip exulting in having outwitted me and made his escape i remember very well how he stood up in the boat and with a smile on his face waved me a mock adieu as he impelled the little craft out toward the middle of the river he was a strong sturdy rower but he had no conception of the strength and rapidity of the current he battled manfully but the boat immediately began to tend towards the cataract with continually increasing rapidity at length he came to realize the fate that certainly awaited him his smile was succeeded by a look of despair i can see even now the expression of terror and desperation formed upon the poor fellows face when he saw that struggle as he might there was no help or deliverance i am sure at that time he would have welcomed me as a friend and savior and gone with me willingly to prison if only he could have been rescued from the impending doom still however he plied the oars with desperate vigor and would not resign himself to his fate i was painfully excited and in the poor fellows peril quite forgot that he was a criminal of whom i was in pursuit the end came speedily when six feet from the edge of the cataract he dropped his oars threw up his hands and an instant later boat and man were swept down into the gulf below was his body ever found asked fred yes but it was so mangled as to be almost beyond recognition many a time when looking at the falls i have pictured to myself the unhappy victim of that days tragedy i suppose said frank it is impossible to go over the cataract and live not if all stories are to be believed there is a boy in the village here who is said to have gone over the falls and yet he does not seem to have suffered any injury the same story is told of a cat but cats are noted for having nine lives and therefore the story is not so surprising after a little more chat the three left the island and returned to the mainland they had hardly reached it when a telegraph boy approached mr ferguson and handed him a despatch he opened it and read as follows elmira sunday my nephew edmund lawrence is at niagara communicate with him philo carver this is your business said the detective handing the telegram to fred let us try to find mr lawrence said fred after reading it it will be the best way mr carver does not mention at what hotel his nephew is staying probably he does not know undoubtedly you are right what will you do there is only one thing to do to call at the principal hotels and look over the registers we will go first to the international very well sir ferguson scanned fred with a smile you certainly dont act like one under suspicion he said fred smiled in return i find it hard to realize that i am a suspected burglar he responded so do i let us hope that you will very soon be cleared from suspicion the detective and the two boys turned their steps towards the spacious and attractive international it seems a little ahead of the lynch house said fred but probably the prices at the latter suit my pocketbook better they stepped on the piazza and went into the office mr ferguson opened the hotel register and among the recent entries found the name of edmund lawrence is mr lawrence in he asked the clerk yes sir he came in from a walk five minutes since i will send up my card the detective wrote on a blank card oscar ferguson detective important this was handed to a hall boy who took it up to mr lawrences room and returned with a message that the gentleman was to come up at once i think you will have to go with me said ferguson to fred it wont do for me to give you a chance to escape that is the last thing i have in mind said the trainboy but i shall be glad to see mr lawrence edmund lawrence a pleasantlooking man of middle age looked somewhat surprised when turning his eyes toward the door he saw ferguson enter followed by two boys you wish to see me on important business he said interrogatively yes sir and you are a detective yes sir i hope that i have not fallen under any suspicion not at all have you heard that your uncle philo carver of elmira has been the victim of a burglary no tell me about it the detective told the story and mr lawrence listened with great interest is any one suspected he asked a party has been arrested on suspicion answered the detective indeed who is it this boy answered ferguson pointing to fred impossible ejaculated lawrence eying fred with incredulous amazement chapter xv mr palmer walks into a trap nevertheless it is true i arrested him at the lynch house this morning affirmed the detective do you believe him guilty asked mr lawrence noting with perplexity freds open countenance and tranquil manner no still circumstances are against him please explain i found your uncles gold watch and chain in his bundle is it possible it is quite true mr lawrence said fred calmly mr ferguson will allow me to say that i was as much surprised as he to find them the bundle was a small one and only contained a shirt and collar which i bought at jersey city yesterday morning i can only say that the watch was not in the bundle then perhaps said lawrence who was favorably impressed by freds openness you have some theory as to the manner in which the watch got into your bag yes sir i have i had for a roommate a stranger a man whom i only met last evening after the train arrived we fell in with each other the way to the hotel we were obliged to room together on account of there being but one room vacant at the hotel what was the mans appearance he was rather tall thin and dark complexioned though it was late he did not go to bed at once but sat up for a while finishing a book in which he was interested when i awoke in the morning he was gone you think he was the real burglar yes sir what is your reason because it must have been he that put the watch and chain in my bundle with a view of diverting suspicion from himself yes sir one question more when were you in elmira last i was never in elmira at all said fred promptly i have never been so far west before what was your object in making your present journey i came to make money answered fred smiling that answer may go against you said the detective not when i explain that i am the train boy i have usually made short runs but yesterday morning the superintendent told me i was to go to niagara and gave me permission to stay over sunday to have a chance to see the falls i began to think i would not see them after all but mr ferguson was kind enough to walk out with me and let me have a view of them is this boy also a train boy asked lawrence indicating frank hamblin no he is related to the clerk of the lynch house and was kind enough to come up to my room and keep me company who has the watch asked lawrence after a pause i have answered the detective producing it lawrence took it from his hand it is my uncles watch sure enough he said i remember it a dozen years since he sent to europe for it his name is in it said ferguson but for that i might not have recognized it as one of the articles lost do you know what was taken besides money and securities i am informed but to what value i have not learned you think the boys roommate has them in his possession there seems to be little doubt of it where do you think he is on the canada side no doubt he went there this morning yes i was myself at the clifton house this morning and i now remember the arrival of a man presenting the appearance of this young fellows roommate he is probably still at the clifton house then he is beyond my jurisdiction said ferguson do you remember what luggage he had asked lawrence turning to fred he had a small valise about the size of this said fred his eyes resting on the satchel which lawrence had brought from the clifton and thrown down carelessly why continued fred in excitement this is his valise i recognize it by a dark spot on the side what do you mean said lawrence sharply this is my valise he took it in his hand and uttered an ejaculation the boy is right this is not my valise do you mean to say this valise belongs to the man who roomed with you last night demanded die detective yes i feel sure of it then good heavens it no doubt contains the property stolen from my uncle mr ferguson shall we be justified in opening it i will take the responsibility said the detective he took from his pocket a bent wire and dexterously inserting it in the lock opened the valise all gathered eagerly about it anxious to ascertain whether their suspicions were correct there were a few articles of underwear which the detective took out hastily and laid upon the bed ha here we have it he exclaimed triumphantly as he drew out two long envelopes such as are employed for bonds and securities i will take the liberty to open them one envelope proved to contain two one thousand dollar railroad bonds the other contained two u s government bonds of five hundred dollars each and miscellaneous securities all together amounting to three thousand dollars more a very clever capture on my word said ferguson really mr lawrence you have beaten me in my own line i am entitled to no credit it belongs to the boy who identified the valise i assure you the wrong bag was given me at the clifton most fortunately i am content to lose the few articles which my own contained for the sake of recovering my uncles property it really seems like an interposition of providence i suspect the thief will feel very illsatisfied with the exchange i wonder what he will do about it there was little chance for speculation on this point there was a knock at the door and a hall boy put in his head there is a gentleman below who wishes to see you mr lawrence he said here is his card mr lawrence took from his hand a card on which had been written the name f grant palmer that is the man mr lawrence exclaimed fred in excitement he has come for his valise bring mr palmer up in about five minutes said lawrence not sooner all right sir now let us repack the valise said the detective i always carry a large bunch of keys with me and shall probably find one that will relock it the shirts socks and other articles which had been taken from the bag were carefully replaced and ferguson as he had thought probable found a key which fitted the lock then the valise was laid carefully on the sofa mr palmer must not see us and particularly the trainboy said the detective or he will think something is up where can you conceal us there is a bedroom attached to the apartment said lawrence go in there all of you and remain till i call you you can leave the door ajar as you will probably be curious to hear what goes on between us capital couldnt be better ferguson followed by the two boys entered the smaller room and waited impatiently for the entrance of palmer a knock was heard come in lawrence called out lazily the door opened and f grant palmer entered carrying in his hand a valise which seemed to be a facsimile of the one lying on the sofa palmers quick eye caught sight of it as he entered the room pardon me for my intrusion he said suavely but i believe we exchanged valises at the clifton this morning chapter xvi palmers malice indeed said lawrence in assumed surprise yes mine was left with the clerk and mine also and he doubtless made a mistake in delivering them upon my word i am not surprised as they certainly are very much alike so they are said lawrence taking the valise from palmers hand and here is your name too it is quite a joke ha ha laughed palmer his spirits rising as he saw that there would be no difficulty in effecting the exchange i suppose i may take mine you are quite sure it is yours pardon my asking but you are a stranger to me oh its all right you see this spot on my valise outside of that there is really no difference you are willing to swear that valise i brought over from the clifton is yours why of course returned palmer in surprise how can there be a doubt after what i have said you will pardon my caution it certainly does seem like it but i dont want to run any risk of giving it to the wrong party oh thats all right said palmer impatiently setting down lawrence in his own mind as a crank probably you have the key that opens it certainly then do you mind opening it and satisfying yourself and me that it really belongs to you surely not said palmer really glad of an opportunity of satisfying himself that the bonds were safe he drew from his pocket a bunch of keys and carefully selecting one inserted it in the lock of the valise it opened at once and palmer eagerly scanned the contents the underclothing had been carefully replaced and he did not discover that it had been disturbed but when he lifted it to look for the envelopes containing the bonds his face underwent a change what is the matter inquired lawrence calmly that valise has been opened said palmer angrily what makes you think so the most valuable contents have been removed i hold you accountable for this mr lawrence continued palmer fiercely please be a little more explicit what is it that you miss two envelopes containing valuable bonds this is a serious charge are you sure they were in the valise of course i am i put them there myself and when i opened the valise this morning they were there wasnt it rash in you to leave articles of such value in your valise can you name any of the bonds yes there were two erie mortgage bonds of a thousand dollars each two government bonds of five hundred dollars each some bank bills and miscellaneous securities you dont mean it and you placed them there i did and i am willing to swear to the statement i demand of you sir where they are mr lawrence rose from his seat and on pretense of examining the contents of the open valise managed to get in between palmer and the door a man in my employ had charge of the valise for a short time he said he may have opened it where is he he must be arrested before he can get away said palmer in excitement ferguson called mr lawrence the detective who had of course heard all that had passed stepped out from the inner room he assumed the tone of a servant did you call sir he asked yes i am at your service this gentleman here claims the valise as his property he says that some bonds have been abstracted from it am i right yes assented palmer with a fierce glance at the detective he charges me with having opened the valise and taken them what does he say to that demanded palmer in excitement it is true said ferguson calmly you hear said palmer give me back those bonds you scoundrel and i may let you go free otherwise i will have you arrested and you can guess what will follow dont let the fellow escape he added quickly as the detective edged towards the door lawrence upon this went to the door and locked it what have you to say for yourself he demanded turning to ferguson only that i am a detective and that i am specially deputed to search for and recover the bonds stolen from philo carver of elmira yesterday afternoon i have reason to think i have found them duped exclaimed palmer sinking into a chair in dismay yes mr palmer it looks like it there is one article missing a gold watch and chain i dont know anything about them we may find some one who does fred at the summons the train boy stepped out from the inner room followed by frank hamblin at sight of his late roommate palmer first showed surprise and then anger did you put up this job on me he asked fiercely it seems that you put up a job on me said fred quietly the watch was found in my bundle yes that was to be your share answered palmer maliciously gentlemen i suppose i shall have to surrender at discretion but i am not the only guilty party that boy is my confederate it is an outrageous falsehood burst out fred indignantly it is of no use your denying it i am convinced that you have betrayed me and i will have no mercy on you gentlemen arrest me if you think best but arrest him too he is just as guilty as i am you assert that he is your confederate said lawrence yes how long have you known him ever since he was born his mother was a cousin of mine palmer asserted unblushingly do you believe this mr ferguson asked fred quite overwhelmed i never saw this man till last evening if he is your cousin what is his name asked the detective not answering freds appeal fred fenton said palmer coolly he has got my name right but he saw it in the hotel register said fred i presume you are right said ferguson you seem interested in my young cousin said palmer with a malicious sneer do you mean to say that he was with you in elmira asked lawrence yes he stood outside to warn me if any one came along who was likely to interfere with me and you both took the train for niagara after the burglary was effected exactly lawrence was staggered by the positive assertions of the culprit it must be considered that he was not acquainted with fred who so far as he knew might be an artful young adventurer why didnt you take the boy over to the canada side with you it was understood that he was to come over later in the day we passed for strangers at the lynch house and i thought it might excite suspicion if we both went away together at so early an hour in the morning mr palmer said fred warmly you know perfectly well that all these statements are false and that i never met you or had anything to do with you till last evening it wont do fred said the burglar you and i are in the same boat you are a boy and will probably get a lighter sentence than i but you shouldnt go back on your old pal like this do you believe that man mr ferguson asked fred with a troubled look no but i shall be obliged to hold you till i produce him in court tomorrow chapter xvii two young lady passengers at odds ferguson produced a pair of handcuffs and pinioned the wrists of his captive palmer protested against the humiliation but ferguson said quietly you are too important a prisoner for me to run any risk are you going to handcuff him asked the burglar indicating fred no why not why should you treat him better than me i dont think he is guilty but even if he is i am not afraid of his running away you are deceived in him he looks innocent enough but he has been concerned in a dozen burglaries i hear considerable news about myself said fred but the truth will come out at last as the party passed through the streets they naturally attracted considerable attention though a criminal palmer had for years evaded arrest and he felt mortified at the position in which he was placed he reflected bitterly that but for the mistake of the hotel clerk he might be at ease with his booty on the canada side as it was things seemed to have worked steadily against him notwithstanding his clever schemes a long term of imprisonment stared him in the face instead of a couple of years of luxury on which he had counted if he could only involve fred in his own misfortune it would be partial satisfaction to effect this he was prepared to swear to anything and everything fred though only nominally a prisoner felt very uncomfortable he was saved from the disgrace of being handcuffed and was consoled by knowing that not even the detective believed him guilty of any connection with the burglary still he was not his own master to come and go as he pleased and it was not certain that he would be able to go back to new york the next day as he had planned circumstances thus far had worked against him but there was to be a turn in the tide as they walked through the streets on the way to the station house where palmer was to be locked up for safekeeping they met a man whose dress showed him to be an employee of the erie road mr ferguson said fred eagerly that is the conductor of one of my trains he will tell you that i am the trainboy the conductor had just discovered and recognized fred you are staying over like me he said yes i have permission and so have i i have a brother living here and got two days off where are you stopping at the lynch house will you tell this gentleman that i am an erie train boy certainly but why is that necessary asked the conductor in surprise i will tell you later mr ferguson have you any questions to ask was this boy on your train yesterday yes did he get on at elmira certainly not he came all the way from new york it is false said palmer what does he mean fred asked the conductor he committed a burglary at elmira yesterday afternoon and is trying to make out that i was connected with it there he tells a falsehood said the conductor bluntly i saw you on the train through the entire journey a very good alibi fred said the detective mr lawrence after this testimony it is hardly necessary for me to hold the boy are you satisfied that i should let him go free entirely so i felt from the first that he was innocent then fred you may consider yourself at liberty to go where you please i am as glad as you are that you are freed from suspicion thank you sir i will go with you as far as the lockup palmer scowled at him but saw that it was useless to persist in his charges against the boy and walked on with head bent reflecting bitterly that he had not only lost the proceeds of the burglary but his freedom besides he could see now that but for his secreting the stolen watch and chain in freds bundle he would probably have escaped scot free as for the present at least we shall have nothing more to do with f grant palmer it may be briefly set down that after a speedy trial he was found guilty by the jury without leaving their seats he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and is now serving out his term at auburn daring the remainder of his stay at niagara fred used his time to advantage and it was with a thankful heart that he took his place on the through train to new york the next morning just before starting mr lawrence appeared on the platform and handed him a small package covered with brown paper have you a pocket where this will be safe he asked yes sir then put it away and open it when you arrive home thank you sir freds attention was taken up by his duties as train boy and he gave no thought to the package though he wondered at the moment what it contained the train left at and was not due in jersey city till pm at port jervis a young lady came on board dressed in a very plain and quiet manner in his rounds through the train fred stopped at her seat with a pile of recent novels under his arm and asked her to buy no thank you she answered courteously and fred observed that her face was very sad if she had been dressed in mourning he would have supposed that she had lost a near relative but there was nothing in her dress to justify such a supposition being naturally sympathetic fred from time to time glanced at the young lady passenger wishing it were in his power to lighten her sorrow whatever it might be sitting next to her was a young lady handsomely dressed who was evidently annoyed at the near neighborhood of one whom she considered her social inferior it chanced to be the only seat unoccupied when the train reached port jervis and the young lady was compelled to avail herself of it but when she reached the seat she found it occupied by a fat poodle of uncertain temper belonging to the fashionable young lady may i take this seat asked the new arrival dont you see that it is occupied snapped the dogs owner there is no other seat vacant said the new passenger deprecatingly then you had better go into the next car as the young girl stood in the aisle undecided fred who had heard the entire colloquy and was naturally indignant made up his mind to interfere these seats were meant for passengers not for dogs he said boy you are impertinent said the fashionable young lady haughtily where is the impertinence asked fred composedly do you wish this young lady to stand up in order that your dog may have a seat i will report you to the railroad company for insolence just as you like but i will remove the dog in order to give this young lady a seat oh i dont want to make any trouble said the new arrival touch my dog if you dare boy said the young lady with a flush of anger on her face just then the conductor entered the car and fred called him mr collins he said this young lady refuses to remove her dog from the seat to make room for a passenger is this true madam asked the conductor she can go into the next car are you paying for two seats no snapped the lady i must take your dog into the baggage car it is against our rules to have them in the regular cars and they certainly cannot be allowed to keep our passengers from occupying seats dont you dare to touch my dog do you go to jersey city yes then you can call for the dog there and in spite of the remonstrance of the dogs owner and the growling of the poodle the conductor removed the animal to the baggage car much to the secret satisfaction of the passengers who had observed with disgust the selfishness of its owner i am indebted to you for this said the young lady with a furious glance at the train boy fred did not think himself called upon to make any answer the young lady scornfully drew aside her dress to avoid contact with her unwelcome companion saying audibly it is only in america that servant girls are allowed to thrust themselves in the company of their betters i am not a servant girl said the new passenger but even if i were i have paid my fare and am entitled to a seat do not address me girl said her seatmate haughtily i thought your remark was addressed to me i am forced to sit beside you but i dont care to converse with you the other took the hint and left her undemocratic neighbor to herself fred was naturally a little curious to ascertain the name of the young lady who had made herself so disagreeable the mystery was solved in a way to surprise him on reaching the depot at jersey city all the passengers left the cars the young lady looked about her evidently in search of some one whom she expected to meet her greatly to freds surprise his cousin raymond ferguson turned out to be the party expected here you are sis he said come right along it is late i cant go yet my poor little fido is in the baggage car they wouldnt let me have him in the car with me go and get him and i will stay here gracious thought fred that must be cousin fergusons daughter luella well i cant say i am proud of the relationship chapter xviii unsatisfactory relations miss ferguson waited till her brother returned with the dog who seemed to be in a bad humor my precious fido exclaimed the young lady as she embraced the little animal did they put him in the dirty baggage car then turning to fred who stood by she said spitefully it was all your work you impertinent boy i have a great mind to report you to the president of the road raymonds attention was directed to fred by his sisters attack fred fenton he exclaimed in surprise yes answered fred amused i was not aware that it was your sister and a relative of mine when i took sides against her what does the boy mean demanded miss ferguson haughtily it is fred fenton explained raymond deprecatingly does he claim relationship with me asked the young lady looking disgusted no miss ferguson i dont claim it though i believe it exists said fred a common train boy ejaculated the young lady this is altogether too much raymond let us go as they left the station the other young lady passenger who had listened eagerly to the conversation asked in a tone of almost painful excitement is that the daughter of robert ferguson yes do you know him asked fred in surprise to my sorrow when my poor father died mr ferguson was appointed executor and trustee of his estate it was not large but we supposed it would amount to ten thousand dollars and perhaps more last week my mother received a letter from him stating that he had satisfied all claims against the estate and that only seventyfive dollars was left this leaves us wellnigh penniless is it possible do you suspect that any fraud has been practised upon you my mother feels sure of it but what can we do we are poor and the poor are always friendless continued the girl bitterly have you come to new york to see mr ferguson yes my mother wishes me to ask full particulars and to appeal to him to do us justice i fear it will be of no avail but it is the only thing that we can do pardon me said fred but we had better be getting on board the ferryboat or we shall have to wait till the next thank you i hardly know what i am doing fred accompanied the young lady to the ladies cabin and sat down beside her can i be of any service to you asked the train boy it is late for a young lady to arrive in new york i supposed we should reach the city at nine that is what a neighbor told me i hardly know where to go she added timidly can you recommend a cheap hotel or boardinghouse there would be a difficulty about obtaining admission to either this evening then what shall i do asked the girl looking distressed i think you had better come home with me for tonight our home is a very humble one but mother will take good care of you tomorrow you can make other arrangements if you desire oh how kind you are i should like nothing better if you really think your mother would not be annoyed fred smiled she is too kindhearted for that he said just wait till you see her and you wont feel any doubt how fortunate i am to fall in with such a friend i now see how unwise it was for me to take such a late train they walked to the cortlandt street station of the sixth avenue elevated road and ascended the steps in spite of her anxieties the young lady felt interested in the novel means of locomotion and asked a variety of questions of the train boy at thirtythird street they descended and walking a short distance up broadway turned down a side street and were soon at the door of freds modest home mrs fenton was sitting up and had come to feel anxious how long you have been away fred she said not quite three days mother but you were never away before bertie and i have missed you very much mother said fred you dont see that i have company then for the first time the widow observed the young lady who is it fred she asked as a wild and improbable suspicion entered her mind could it be that fred who was only a boy in years had contracted a marriage and brought his wife home i shall have to ask the young lady to introduce herself said fred my name is ruth patton said the girl timidly i hope you will not be angry with your son for bringing me here i am a stranger in the city and indeed i did not know that the train arrived so late your son told me that it would be difficult to get into any hotel or boardinghouse at this hour and i have ventured to throw myself on your hospitality for tonight you are heartily welcome said mrs fenton ready to smile at her first wild suspicion remove your wraps and in ten minutes i can offer you a cup of tea and some eggs and toast you will sleep the better for a little supper you are a wise woman mother said fred you have guessed what i was longing for let me help you mrs fenton said ruth already looking more cheerful then you may toast the bread said mrs fenton i dont dare to trust fred i did once to my sorrow and the toast turned out to be as black as my shoe i can promise to do better than that i have plenty of experience she set herself to the task as if she felt quite at home and soon they were able to sit down to a plain but welcome supper do you know mother said fred between mouthfuls luella ferguson was on the train how did you recognize her did she speak to you fred smiled roguishly she did shall i tell you what she said i should be glad to hear it she said boy i will report you to the railroad company for insolence shes a sweet girl cousin luella but you were not really insolent thereupon fred told the whole story and his mother agreed with him that miss fergusons conduct was very selfish and unladylike whats more mother miss patton tells me that cousin ferguson has cheated her mother and herself out of ten thousand dollars ill tell you about it tomorrow it is just striking twelve and i can hardly keep my eyes open chapter xix ruth patton calls on mr ferguson the next day ruth patton confided her story to mrs fenton my mother and i she said in our grief for fathers death never dreamed that it would bring us destitution though he never furnished us particulars of his pecuniary condition he gave us to understand that he would be comfortably provided for robert ferguson we knew to have been a lifelong friend or perhaps i should rather say acquaintance and we felt that as a trustee he would consider our interests we were thunderstruck when a letter was received from him last week stating that in place of the ten thousand dollars on which we fully counted a pitiful balance of seventyfive dollars alone remained to us it was shameful said mrs fenton indignantly nearly all of this sum will be swallowed up by small debts due in port jervis you will understand now why i have come to lay our case before mr ferguson and see if he cannot give us more or at any rate find me employment for on me now rests the duty of providing for my poor mother i wish i could encourage you miss patton dont call me miss patton i look upon yon as a kind friend and hope you will call me ruth so indeed i will for i feel a strong interest in you ruth and i will look to you for advice then i advise you to call this evening on mr ferguson and find out the worst meanwhile perhaps you can direct me to a cheap boardinghouse you will stay here till you have had time to form your plans i will gladly do so if you will let me pay you all in good time ruth today you can help me if you will and it will be time to pay board when you are earning something it was not till he sat down to an early breakfast that fred thought of the package handed him by mr lawrence at the niagara falls station he opened it in some curiosity and to his surprise discovered a roll of bills accompanied by this note to fred fenton my young friend though i have not yet had a chance to communicate with my uncle in elmira i feel authorized to act as his representative and in his name ask you to accept the inclosed sum as an acknowledgment of your valuable assistance in bringing about the recovery of the securities stolen from his house and incidentally as a recompense for the annoyance you experienced in being yourself suspected your conduct has been very creditable and i feel that to you we are largely indebted for the recovery of the property and the conviction of the burglar i infer that you are mainly dependent on your earnings which are probably limited and i therefore take pleasure in handing you a substantial reward which i hope will be of service to you yours sincerely edmund lawrence fred counted the bills and alike to his surprise and gratification found that they amounted to two hundred dollars where did you get so much money fred asked his mother entering the room as he completed his count that letter will explain mother answered fred radiant with delight we are indeed rich said mrs fenton joyfully this removes all anxiety for a long time to come yes we can afford to snap our fingers at the landlord i hope you are not going to carry all this money round with you fred you might get robbed i shall deposit it in the dime savings bank this forenoon but you will leave before the bank opens no i am to take a midday train at ten oclock fred went to the union dime savings bank fronting on thirtysecond street and deposited the hundred dollars in gold left him by his mining friend and one hundred and seventyfive dollars besides from his recent gift the other twentyfive he handed to his mother mother he said you need a new dress and albert needs a new suit take this money and buy what you think best i can go a little longer without a dress fred but i dont want you to we can spare the money well enough and there is no better way to spend it mrs fenton made no further opposition but during the day asked ruth patton to accompany her to one of the large stores on sixth avenue where the necessary purchases were made in the evening ruth set out for her call upon mr robert ferguson she ascended the steps in a state of nervous agitation for she felt that the interview was of momentous importance to her and in a low voice asked the servant who answered the bell if she could see mr ferguson i will ask miss said the servant surveying her plain dress with some disdain a young lady to see me said robert ferguson in surprise are you sure it is not my daughter she wishes to see no sir she expressly asked to see you mr ferguson was a widower and rather vain of his personal attractions perhaps the young lady might have been struck by his appearance you can show her up he said amiably and turned to catch a further glance in a mirror just opposite he straightened his necktie and passed his hand softly over his hair to make sure that it was smooth and then turned to the door to catch the first glimpse of his visitor nothing thus far has been said of the outward appearance of ruth patton notwithstanding her anxious face she was unusually pretty and her manners were refined and ladylike mr ferguson she said inquiringly pausing at the door come in my dear young lady said robert ferguson graciously i am pleased to see you thank you sir pray sit down he is much kinder than i supposed thought ruth i must have misjudged him i wrote to you a few days since she began indeed i dont think i can have received your letter but you answered it sir i answered a letter from you what then is your name ruth patton oh returned ferguson his face darkening he no longer felt inclined to be gracious for he had a premonition that the interview would not be agreeable to him my mother and i were quite overwhelmed by the news you sent us we had no idea that my father left so little and she wished me to come on and ask for some particulars i have very little to tell you beyond what i wrote said mr ferguson coldly my father led us to think that we should be comfortably provided for many men have very vague ideas of how they stand your father did wrong in not insuring his life he did not think it would be necessary he thought we should be sufficiently provided for without that he had no right to think so said ferguson irritably you see how things have turned out but what can have become of all the money i hope miss patton you dont think i have spirited it away no sir dont be offended but it seems so strange faltered ruth the money was unwisely invested a large part of it was in wildcat mining stocks which were not worth the paper they were written on father never spoke to us about any such investments i presume not most men keep such matters to themselves well the upshot is that but seventyfive dollars are left i presume your mother received my check for this amount yes sir then that is all i can do for you i will in time forward a bill of particulars a present i am busy at this moment luella ferguson entered the room she recognized ruth at once you here she said in haughty surprise yes i came on business we do not want any servants papa this girl was very insolent to me on the train yesterday i hope you will send her away i am going miss ferguson said ruth with spirit your father was the trustee of my poor fathers property and it was to ask about it that i came here good evening she left the house with faltering steps for her last hope had been destroyed and she felt keenly the cruel slight of luella ferguson as she set foot on the sidewalk her brain reeled and she would have fallen had not a young man who was about to ascend the steps sprung forward and supported her chapter xx a friend in need ruth patton recovered herself by a great effort i wont trouble you any longer sir she faltered i think i can do without further assistance excuse me for doubting it you look very weak take my arm there is a drug store not far away where i can procure you a strengthening draught i am sorry to trouble you so much she murmured apologetically it is no trouble i assure you i count myself fortunate in being on hand so opportunely ruth for the first time encouraged by his kind words stole a glance at the stranger he was a well made and unusually handsome young man of perhaps twentyseven his careful dress and something in his manner seemed to indicate high social position the indication corresponded with the fact alfred lindsay belonged to an old and distinguished new york family though his means were ample he was not content to be an idler but after careful preparation at columbia college and law school he had opened a law office in the mills building and was already beginning to be known as a young man with a future his wealth and high social standing led him to be considered a catch in the matrimonial market it is safe to say that at least half a dozen young ladies had set their caps for him among these was luella ferguson and there were those who considered her chance of landing the prize the best at any rate mr lindsay who had been employed by the elder ferguson in some legal matter became a frequent caller to the great satisfaction of luella ferguson it may not be considered a mark of taste on the part of the young man to have fallen a victim to the young ladys arts but in his presence she was all that was amiable she was not without a certain attractiveness of face which had it been joined to an equally agreeable disposition might have proved a good excuse to any young man for succumbing to her fascinations never for a moment had he cause to suspect that she was otherwise than she seemed kind and sympathetic himself the absence of these qualities if known to him would have rendered her repulsive to him he conducted ruth to a drug store and the druggist administered restoratives that soon brought back her strength and color but not her cheerfulness i am strong enough now to go on my way she said rising how can i thank you sir for your kindness by allowing me to see you to your own door and this he insisted on despite ruths protest would it be indiscreet he asked when they had set out on their way to ask if you can account for your sudden illness i had a shock she answered of what sort are you willing to make me your confidant i do not ask out of curiosity but because it may be in my power to serve you i have so few friends that i will not decline your kind offer you were coming from the house of mr robert ferguson yes sir do you know him quite well i was myself going there is he considered an honorable man why surely what can lead you to doubt it in answer ruth told her story the young lawyer listened in pained surprise strictly honorable himself he found it hard to believe that a man whom he knew so well could be guilty of the meanness of defrauding two women whose interests had been confided to him yet the story seemed probable moreover even had matters been as mr ferguson represented his want of feeling seemed almost as bad as absolute dishonesty he asked ruth several questions in order that he might become fully possessed of all particulars this then was the cause of your agitation he said at length not wholly it was the treatment i received from miss ferguson that affected me most miss ferguson do you know miss ferguson lindsay asked quickly i met her for the first time yesterday afternoon where may i ask in the erie train i entered the cars at port jervis she was already on board but i do not know from what point she had come i think i know she had been visiting a school friend at binghamton you know her then yes i met her at a party about a year since if she is a friend of yours i will not say anything to her disadvantage but i want you to tell me all there is to tell i have a special reason for learning all i can about her you say she treated you ill she treated me cruelly she took offense in the cars because the conductor removed her dog from a seat in order to make room for me was there no other seat in the car none or i would not have disturbed her i did not like to stand all the way from port jervis to new york of course not please favor me with the particulars the young man listened attentively while ruth in simple language not exaggerating in any respect told her story young lindsays brow contracted for he felt indignant at the cold selfishness shown by the young lady who had hitherto attracted him he felt that if it were all true he could never again look upon her even with ordinary friendship she feigned to look upon me as a servant ruth concluded and sharply rebuked me for thrusting myself upon her i would gladly have taken another seat had any been unoccupied but the car was full i heard from the train boy that it was on account of an excursion to shohola glen i confess miss patton ruth had told her name i am surprised and pained by what you have told me i never knew that luella miss ferguson had such unlovely traits to me she has always seemed kind and considerate looking in the young mans expressive face ruth patton felt that she understood better than he why miss ferguson had assumed to be what she was not she was not surprised that luella should desire to make a favorable impression upon one who seemed to her the most attractive young man she had ever met but of course she could not give utterance to the thought that was in her mind and remained silent to change the subject said lindsay after a pause may i ask what are your plans if you have any i must try to earn some money if if you would advise me with pleasure let me ask first what you can do i used to do some copying for a lawyer at port jervis you are used then to copying legal documents i have done considerable of it you do not use the typewriter no i have never learned alfred lindsay paused and his expressive face showed that he was busy thinking i am a lawyer he said at length and i have copying to do of course would you mind calling upon me at my office tomorrow morning i shall be very glad to do so answered ruth her eyes lighting up with newborn hopes i think i can promise you something to do oh sir you dont know how your words cheer me this is where i live thank you very much for your kind escort dont mention it i will expect you tomorrow and the young man took off his hat as respectfully as if ruth instead of being a poor girl in search of work were a lady in his own set chapter xxi luellas painful discovery what business had that girl with you papa asked luella ferguson when stung by her insolence ruth had left the house she told you answered the father evasively is it true that you were trustee of any property belonging to her well there is some truth in it her father was an old schoolmate of mine though we were never intimate and when he died considerably to my surprise he asked me to settle his estate how much did it amount to after paying all bills including funeral expenses there was seventyfive dollars left a fine estate upon my word said luella with a scornful laugh really the girl is a great heiress she thought she ought to have been what do you think she and her mother expected something amusing no doubt they thought that they would realize ten thousand dollars and be completely provided for they must be fools we wont use so harsh an expression women know very little about business some women papa you will please make an exception in my case well i admit luella said her father complacently you do seem to have a sharp eye to your own interests why shouldnt i i come honestly by it papa dont i well perhaps you have been pretty sharp yourself eh papa i fancy you have a pretty good sum of money salted down thats the term isnt it well i have something but i dont care to make a boast of it there would be plenty who would want a share for instance mrs fenton that reminds me her son is a trainboy on the erie road did you see him yes he made himself very obnoxious by his impertinent intermeddling he insisted upon my removing my poor fido in order to give that girl a seat what concern was it of his none at all but he made such a fuss that i had to do it you need not have done so the train boy has no authority in such matters he called the conductor and he took my poor darling into the baggage car papa cant you get him discharged i have no influence with the erie officials my dear besides if i deprive him of his chance to make a living he and his mother will be importuning me for money better leave well enough alone this was the sort of argument that weighed with luella ferguson she was meanness personified and would rather save money than be revenged upon fred do you think you will have any more trouble with this girl who called tonight i should not be surprised if she called again to ask me to help her to employment if she does advise her to go out to service she could get a position as chambermaid without difficulty remember luella that in her own town she has held a good social position she may have too much pride then let her starve said luella harshly it is preposterous for a pauper to be proud she is not exactly a pauper said mr ferguson who was not quite so venomous in his hatred as his daughter i forgot she has a fortune of seventyfive dollars will you do me a favor what is it if the girl comes again turn her over to me very well my dear i shall be glad to do so it will relieve me from embarrassment i shall feel no embarrassment i shall rather enjoy it by the way luella how are you getting on with young lindsay luella flushed a little and a softer light shone in her eyes she had very little heart but such as she had was given to alfred lindsay at first attracted by his wealth and social position for on his mothers side he belonged to one of the knickerbocker families she had ended by really falling in love with him in his company she appeared at her best her amiable and attractive manners were not wholly assumed for the potent spell of love softened her and transformed her from a hard cynical selfish girl to a woman seeking to charm one who had touched her heart he comes to see me very often papa she answered coyly and he seems impressed i think so said luella lowering her eyes while a gratified smile lighted up her face he has never actually proposed asked ferguson eagerly well not exactly but from his manner i think he will soon i hope so luella there is no one whom i would more prefer for a soninlaw i shall not say him nay papa of course not he is rich and of distinguished family he will make a very suitable mate for you yes papa i appreciate that but you too are rich and of high social position well daughter i stand fairly but as to family i cant boast much my father your grandfather was a village blacksmith i have never told you that before horrors papa exclaimed luella you cannot mean this it is a sober fact i have never told you for i knew it would shock you does any one know it in our circle no indeed the only one who is likely to have any knowledge of it is mrs fenton and her son the train boy yes if it should get out i should die of mortification neither you nor i are likely to mention it i only referred to it to show the advantages of marrying a man of high lineage like alfred lindsay i have money but i have never been able to get into the inner circle to which the lindsays belong money will buy much but it wont buy that i hope yon will do your best to bring the young mail to the point i will manage it papa said luella complacently do you know i have made up my mind to go to europe on a wedding trip if lindsay consents he will do whatever i wish i expect him to call this evening do you yes and papa something might happen added luella playfully i hope so sincerely my dear mind if he comes to you not a word about the blacksmith i wish you hadnt told me forget it then luella we will keep it a profound secret luella left her fathers presence with a smile upon her face it was already eight oclock half an hour passed and she became anxious fifteen minutes more clipped by and still the welcome ring at the bell was not heard she was ready to cry with vexation for she had made up her mind to lead the young man to a declaration that very evening if it were a possible thing she summoned a servant jane she said mr lindsay has not called this evening has he no miss if he had of course i would tell you i thought perhaps there might have been some mistake if he should come and it isnt very late yet let me know at once surely i will miss luella shes dead gone on that man said jane to herself well i dont wonder for he is awfully handsome thats a fact but my if he could only see her in some of her tantrums hed open his eyes he thinks shes an angel but i know her better several days passed and still alfred lindsay did not call luella became alarmed was she losing her hold upon him she was considering whether it would be proper to write a letter to the young lawyer at his office when she chanced to make a very painful discovery about five oclock on saturday afternoon she was coming out of lord taylors uptown store when in a plainly dressed girl who was just passing she recognized ruth patton curiosity led her to address ruth so you are still in the city she said abruptly yes miss ferguson answered ruth calmly of course you are very poor i think i can get you a place as chambermaid in the family of one of my friends thank you but i have a position i like better what sort of a position i am in a lawyers office copying legal papers indeed i suppose you are poorly paid i receive ten dollars a week that is ridiculously high pay of course you dont earn it mr lindsay fixed the salary i did not lindsay gasped luella what lindsay alfred lindsay he has his office in the mills building ruth patton passed on having unconsciously given poignant anguish to the haughty miss ferguson where could she have met alfred luella asked herself with contracted brow i must get him to discharge her i had no idea she was such an artful minx chapter xxii miss ferguson writes a note it was indeed true that ruth patton had found employment at ten dollars a week her services were scarcely worth that sum to her employer but alfred lindsay was not only rich but generous and was glad to believe ruths anxiety by insuring her a comfortable income she was still at mrs fentons rooms being now able to contribute her share of the expense incurred the widow was willing to accept only three dollars per week so that ruth had the satisfaction of sending a weekly remittance to her mother she was very grateful for the change in her circumstances and notwithstanding the disappointment about her fathers estate felt that there was reason to hope two days later alfred lindsay found a letter upon his desk addressed in a delicate female hand which he did not recognize a lady client he thought what does she want a divorce when he opened the envelope he read the following note written on a highly perfumed sheet my dear mr lindsay pray dont be shocked at my boldness in writing you but it is so long since you have called that papa suggests sickness as a possible cause i do hope that this is not what has kept you away i confess that i have missed you very much i have so enjoyed our conversations you are not like the fashionable butterflies of whom we meet so many in society one must tolerate them of course but it is a comfort to meet a man who can talk intelligently about books and art apropos i have a new collection of etchings that i want to show you wont you name an evening when you will call as i want to be certain to be at home when you really do come i should be desolated as the french say to be absent now dont fail to answer this screed otherwise i shall certainly manage to have some law business that will give me an excuse for calling at your office very sincerely yours luella ferguson alfred lindsay read this note slowly and there was a smile upon his face for he fully appreciated luellas motive in writing it a fortnight since he would have been charmed but his feelings with respect to miss ferguson had undergone a change the revelation of her real character had shocked him and served effectually to kill his growing attachment beauty of face could not make up for deformity of character on the other hand he was beginning to be attracted by ruth she lacked luellas regular features and cold classic beauty but her sweet face revealed a disposition warm kindly and sympathetic and when her deep serious eyes rested upon him he felt that she was far more attractive than her showy rival what shall i do he asked himself as his eyes fell upon the note he must of course answer it but should he accept the invitation upon the whole he decided to do so there was no reason which he could allege for declining and though it would be to sacrifice an evening he would go armed against luellas fascinations by the knowledge he had acquired he drew out a sheet of paper from a drawer in his desk and wrote as follows my dear miss ferguson as i am writing in my office you will understand and excuse the unfashionable business paper which i am using i am flattered to find that you miss me and still more at the reason you assign for preferring my company to that of the gilded young men who worship at your shrine i am but a plain blunt man as shakspeare has it and cannot vie with them in compliment i shall no doubt find pleasure in examining the etchings which you hold out as an inducement to call i will name thursday evening but should you have a previous engagement dont scruple to notify me as i can easily postpone my visit to another date yours sincerely alfred lindsay luella ferguson read this note with mingled pleasure and disappointment it is very cold she murmured almost as if i were an ordinary acquaintance i suppose men feel hampered when they try to express themselves upon paper i will not believe that he is less friendly or admires me less than he used to do at any rate he is coming and i must make myself as fascinating as possible i have a chance to win him and i mean to do it papa said luella on thursday morning mr lindsay will call here this evening i am glad to hear it luella i hope he is coming on business i dont know she answered demurely you know my wishes on the subject they accord with mine papa when alfred lindsay was announced he found luella resplendent in a new dress and bedecked with jewels she intentionally made herself as attractive as possible really miss ferguson you are radiant tonight he said do you think so she asked there is no doubt of it are you expecting other company only yourself then i am to consider it a special compliment to me if you like then i must express my acknowledgments yet as he spoke his thoughts reverted to ruth patton with her lack of ornament and severe simplicity and he felt that her image was to him the more attractive of the two it was fortunate for miss fergusons peace of mind that she could not read his thoughts now you bad boy she said playfully you must tell me why you have stayed away so long perhaps to see if you would miss me i have missed you so much that is certainly a compliment to me as a conversationalist as you wrote in your note you appreciate my sensible conversation i am afraid you overestimate me i have a friend who is really brilliant and can converse eloquently upon any subject may i bring him with me who is he asked luella hesitatingly professor grimes what the lecturer yes why he is grotesque in appearance i heard him lecture once and thought he wore a mask so ugly was his face you admit his eloquence however yes but from such a mouth even pearls cease to attract pray dont bring him he positively makes me shudder i assure you luella did not like the turn the conversation had taken there seemed no chance for sentiment and she wanted to bring all her fascinations to bear you have some etchings to show me miss ferguson said lindsay after a pause yes but i want to show them to you myself you will have to come and sit beside me willingly answered alfred but his tone was conventional and lacked the warmth it had formerly shown together they looked over the collection luella saw however to her mortification that lindsay was calm and cold it seemed clear that she had lost her power over him what could be the reason can it be that girl ruth patton she asked herself is it she who is drawing alfred lindsay away from me i must warn him against her by the way havent you a copyist in your office named ruth patton how did you know asked lindsay i met her the other day on broadway perhaps you dont know but she is an humble protegee of my fathers a protegee yes papa has been very kind to the family he took charge of their affairs on the death of her father and though there was not enough property to pay the debts he paid them all and sent a check to mrs patton besides that was certainly considerate said lindsay but from his tone it could not be discovered if he were speaking in earnest or ironically as you say it was considerate but this ruth is very ungrateful she was actually ridiculous enough to think they ought to have had a fortune and i believe blames papa for the way things have come out alfred lindsay listened politely but did not express an opinion she is a very good copyist he said i am glad she is earning a living though i think it would have been better for her to remain in the country dont you really i cant judge for others not knowing all the circumstances the girl is ill bred i am sorry to say she treated me rudely in the cars she gives me no cause of complaint said lindsay shortly he understood and despised luellas attempts to prejudice him against the copyist when he rose to go luella was disappointed she felt that she had brought him no nearer and had not strengthened her hold upon him as the young lawyer descended the steps he met a man coming up whom he recognized as a dealer in worthless mining stock who was looked upon by reputable business men with doubt and suspicion what business can orlando jenkins have with mr ferguson he asked himself chapter xxiii another railroad adventure six months have passed and brought with them some changes at the end of two months ruth patton sent for her mother who was feeling very lonely at port jervis and engaged a suite of three rooms over those occupied by mrs fenton and fred though she was away during the day the two ladies living so near together were company for each other ruth had now become advanced to twelve dollars a week not out of charity but because alfred lindsays business had considerably increased and gave his copyist more to do fred was still on the erie road but it was now winter and the travel had so much diminished that where he had formerly earned seven or eight dollars a week he now averaged no more than four he began to be dissatisfied for his income now was inadequate to meet his expenses and he had been obliged to spend twenty dollars out of the two hundred which he had received from mr lawrence at niagara falls he was now seventeen and he felt that it was high time he had entered upon some business in which he could advance by successive steps on the road if he remained till he was thirty years of age he could earn no more than at present he answered several advertisements but secured nothing likely to be an improvement upon his present place one evening toward the end of december he was about to leave the cars when his attention was drawn to an old gentleman with hair nearly white who did not rise with the rest of the passengers but remained in his seat with his head leaned back and his eyes closed the train boy concluding that he had fallen asleep went up to him and touched him gently we have reached jersey city he said the old man opened his eyes slightly and gazed at him bewildered i i dont know where i am he murmured vaguely you are in jersey city sir i want to go to new york you have only to cross the ferry excuse me i am a stranger here i am from ohio where is the ferry let me lead you to the boat sir the old man rose feebly and put his hand to his head i dont know what is the matter with me he said i feel sick perhaps you are upset by your journey come with me and i will take care of you you are a very good boy and i will accept your offer he rose and left the car leaning heavily on freds arm how long have you felt unwell asked the train boy sympathetically ever since we left elmira my head troubles me it is the motion of the cars no doubt here we are they were just in time to reach the boat they entered the ladies cabin as fred thought the tobacco smoke which always pervaded the cabin devoted to men would increase the old gentlemans head trouble where do you wish to go when we have reached the new york side asked fred when they were nearly across the river i have a nephew living on madison avenue do you know that street oh yes sir very well i will go up with you if you will let me know your nephews name the name was mentioned and to freds surprise was that of a wealthy and influential wall street broker it was clear that the old gentleman though plainly dressed would not need to economize i think sir said fred noticing that the old man seemed to be getting more and more feeble that it will be well for you to take a cab in order to avoid any walking you seem very much fatigued you are right will you call one i dont feel able with pleasure sir fred passed through the gate and beckoned a hackman who drove up with alacrity where to sir he asked fred gave the number on madison avenue mr john wainwrignt lives there said the hackman i sometimes drive him up from wall street that is the place this is his uncle the hackman touched his hat respectfully to the old gentleman whom he had at first mentally styled a rusty old codger his relationship to the wealthy broker gave him dignity in the eyes of the driver wont you get in too asked the old gentleman who had come to rely upon fred as his guardian certainly sir i shall feel safer i am a perfect stranger to the city he leaned back in the seat and partially closed his eyes the hack rattled through the streets and in due time reached its destination the hackman opened the door of the cab and fred assisted the old gentleman to alight take my pocketbook and pay him said the old man the hackman did not venture to ask more than his rightful fare as it would have come to the knowledge of the broker whom he did not care to offend the driver paid fred ascended the steps and rang the bell a man servant opened the door is mr wainwright at home asked fred the servant seeing an old man in rather a rusty dress was inclined to think that he was an applicant for charity and answered rather superciliously yes hes at ome but i aint sure as hell see you tell him said fred sharply that his uncle has arrived his uncle repeated the astounded flunkey o yes sir certainly sir i think he is at ome wont you step in sir fred would have gone away but the old gentleman still seemed to require his assistance and he stepped in with him and led him into the drawingroom the servant promptly reported the arrival to mr wainwright who descended the staircase quickly and greeted his uncle you are heartily welcome uncle silas he said i did not expect you till tomorrow or i would have sent the carriage for you i changed my mind john and decided to push through who is this young man with you he is a kind friend john i was taken sick the effect of the journey i think and i shouldnt have been able to get up here but for him the broker smiled pleasantly and held out his hand to fred you are the train boy are you not he asked glancing at freds cap yes sir i hope you find it pays you well not at this season sir how long have you been in service over a year thank you for your kindness to my uncle he seems ill and requires my attention now can you make it convenient to call here tomorrow evening at eight oclock yes sir i will call with pleasure good night then and dont forget to call the broker shook hands with fred again and the trainboy left the house quite won by the pleasant and affable manner of the great broker i never expected to know such a man as that thought fred i wish he would give me a position in his office that would be much better worth having than my present place why are you so late fred asked his mother when he reached home i had to make a call on mr wainwright the broker answered fred i guess you are only funning said albert no i am not i am invited to call again tomorrow evening what for perhaps hes going to take me into partnership said fred in joke chapter xxiv freds good luck fred made a short trip the next day and returned home at four oclock he was glad to be back so early as it gave him time to prepare for his evening visit naturally his mind had dwelt upon it more or less during the day and he looked forward to the occasion with pleasant anticipations the brokers gracious manners led fred to think of him as a friend i would like to be in the employ of such a man he reflected he started from home in good season and found himself on the brokers steps on the stroke of eight the door was opened by the same servant as on the evening previous but he treated fred more respectfully having overheard mr wainwright speak of him cordially so when fred asked is mr wainwright at home he answered yes sir come right in i believe as you are expected the old man was descending the stairs as fred entered and immediately recognized him ha my young friend he said i am glad to see you and he held out his hand i hope you are feeling better sir said fred respectfully oh yes thank you i feel quite myself today it was the length of the journey that upset and fatigued me i couldnt travel every day as you do no sir i suppose not now but when you were of my age it would have been different how old are you seventeen and i am seventyone the same figures but reversed that makes a great difference come in here my nephew will be down at once the train boy followed the old gentleman into the handsome drawingroom and sat down on a sofa feeling it must be owned not quite as much at home as he would have done in a plainer house did you make much today asked silas corwin that was his name in a tone of interest no sir it was a poor day i only sold three dollars worth and how much did that yield you sixty cents i have a commission of twenty per cent what was the most you ever made in a day i took in thirteen dollars once it was on a holiday that would give you two dollars and sixty cents yes sir very good indeed if i could keep that up i should feel like a millionaire perhaps happier than a millionaire i have known millionaires who were weighed down by cares and were far from happy fred listened respectfully but like most boys of his age found it impossible to understand how a very rich man could be otherwise than happy at this point mr john wainwright entered the room good evening my boy he said cordially i wont apologize for being late as my uncle has no doubt entertained you yes sir he was just telling me that millionaires are sometimes unhappy and you did not believe him i think i should be happy if i were worth a million you might feel poorer than you do now i knew a millionaire once a bachelor who did not venture to drink but one cup of coffee at his breakfast he took it at a cheap restaurant because it would involve an added expenditure of five cents was he in his right mind sir i dont wonder you ask i dont think a man who carries economy so far is quite in his right mind however he was shrewd enough in his business transactions but now tell me something about yourself are you alone in the world no sir i have a mother and little brother are they partly dependent upon you yes sir can you make enough to support them comfortably i can in the summer sir but in the winter my earnings are small how small not over four dollars a week that is certainly small do you like your present employment i am getting tired of it answered fred i should be glad to find a place where i can have a chance to rise even if the pay is small what do you think of going into a brokers office freds heart gave a bound i should like it very much he said then i think i can offer you a place in mine come down on saturday and i will introduce you to the office employees and on monday you can begin work i am very much obliged to you mr wainwright before you know how much pay you are to receive asked the broker smiling i can safely trust that to you sir then we will say eight dollars to begin with my mother will be pleased with my good luck i hope i shall prove satisfactory we generally ask references from those about to enter our employment but my uncle here insists that it is unnecessary in your case ill go security for the boy john said silas corwin thank you sir said fred i will see that you dont run any risk at this moment a young girl of fourteen entered the room she was the picture of rosy health and fred looked at her admiringly she too glanced at him curiously fred this is my daughter rose said mr wainwright is this the boy who came home with uncle silas asked the young lady yes rose he looks like a nice boy fred blushed at the compliment but coming from such lips he found it very agreeable thank you he said how old are you continued rose im fourteen i am three years older when i am three years older i shall be a young lady i dont think i shall ever be a young lady said fred demurely why of course you wont you foolish boy said rose with a merry laugh papa may i invite fred to my new years party yes if you like youll come wont you asked rose if your father approves answered fred hesitating of course he does didnt he say so if youll tell me where you live ill send you a card do you dance not much but i will practise beforehand thats right you must dance with me you know rose said her father gravely are you under the impression that this is leap year you seem to be very attentive to this young man rose was the pride of her fathers heart as she might well be for she was an unusually attractive child and had been a good deal indulged but by no means spoiled mr wainwright had no foolish ideas about exclusiveness and was not disturbed by his daughters cordiality to fred do you play backgammon fred asked rose after some further conversation yes a little then ill get the backgammon board and well have a game fred was not a skilful player and the young lady beat him three games in succession which put her in high spirits her favorable opinion of fred was confirmed and when he rose to go she pressed him to come again thank you said fred i shall be very glad indeed to come rose said her father after freds departure it seems to me you have been flirting with fred hes a nice boy dont you think so papa i hope he will prove so for i am going to take him into my office thats good then i shall see him often really rose i was a little alarmed lest you should make him an offer this evening you neednt be afraid papa i will wait till i am a little bit older and then shall you offer yourself to fred perhaps i shall if i dont see any one i like better you must remember he is poor that doesnt make any difference you can give us all the money we want a very satisfactory arrangement upon my word i am glad you dont insist upon getting married at once but give me a few hours to get reconciled to the thought chapter xxv rose wainwrights party as fred would make his debut in fashionable society at rose wainwrights party he was naturally solicitous to make a favorable impression he had for some time been intending to procure a new suit but hesitated on account of the expense now with a new position in prospect and a liberal salary he no longer delayed but purchased a neat black suit a misfit for seventeen dollars and a few small articles of which he stood in need the next thing required was to obtain some knowledge of dancing fortunately he was acquainted with a gentleman who gave private as well as class lessons and was a very successful teacher he called upon professor saville and asked him if he could qualify him to make a creditable appearance at the party how much time have you asked the professor ten days then come to me every evening and i will guarantee to make you more than an average dancer in that time and your terms to you will be half price i know very well fred that you are not a millionaire and will adapt my terms to your circumstances professor saville kept his word and when the eventful day arrived fred felt a degree of confidence in his newlyacquired skill when he was dressed for the party in his new suit with a white silk tie and a pair of patent leather shoes it would have been hard to recognize him as a poor train boy you look nice fred said albert do i i must give you a dime for that compliment now dont go and spend it for whisky i never drink whisky said albert indignantly i was only joking bertie well mother i will bid you goodevening i wish you a pleasant time fred shall you be out late i cant tell mother it is so long since i have been to a fashionable party that i have forgotten when they do close some of the boys who attended miss wainwrights party engaged cabs but fred would have thought this a foolish expenditure it was a dry crisp day with no snow on the ground and he felt that it would do him no harm to walk he did not expect to meet any one he knew but on turning into madison avenue he nearly ran into raymond ferguson raymond did not at first recognize him when he did he surveyed him in his party dress in unconcealed amazement where did you get that rig he inquired with more abruptness than ceremony fred was glad to meet raymond and enjoyed his surprise i bought it he answered briefly but why did you buy it i dont see where you found the money youd better have saved it for food and rent ill think over your advice cousin raymond said fred with a twinkle of fun in his eyes were you going to call at our house asked raymond not this evening i dont care to have you call me cousin raymond i wont then i am just as much ashamed of the relationship as you are if thats a joke its a very poor one said raymond provoked its no joke i assure you fred seemed so cool and composed that his cousin was nonplussed he started as if to go on but curiosity got the better of him you havent told me where you were going in that absurd dress he said i dont see anything absurd in it i am going to a party to a party what party miss rose wainwrights what the daughter of mr wainwright the broker asked raymond incredulously yes now it happened that raymond had been particularly anxious to get an invitation to this party some of his friends at the columbia grammar school were going and he had intrigued but unsuccessfully to get a card of invitation the idea that his cousin an obscure train boy had succeeded where he had failed seemed absurd and preposterous it intensified his disappointment and made him foolishly jealous of fred there must be some mistake about this he said harshly you only imagine that you are invited i am not quite a fool cousin raymond excuse me mr ferguson what do you say to this he drew from his pocket a note of invitation requesting the favor of mr fred fentons company at miss rose wainwrights new years party how did she happen to send you this card asked raymond his surprise increasing you dont mean to say you know rose wainwright yes i know her i spent an evening at the house nearly two weeks ago and played backgammon with her i never heard the like have any bootblacks been invited i dont know the young lady didnt tell me who were coming take my advice and dont go why not you will be about as much at home at a fashionable party as a cat would be at the opera but i have accepted the invitation that wont matter you can write a note tomorrow saying that you thought it wiser to stay away besides there is another objection what is that rose expects me to dance with her you dance certainly why not i begin to think you are crazy fred fenton i dont see why of course you cant dance of course i can i am a pupil of professor saville but i must bid you good evening as it is time i was at the party raymond gazed after fred as he walked toward the scene of the evenings enjoyment with corrugated brows i never heard of anything more ridiculous he muttered its like a beggar on horseback think of a poor boy like fred figuring at rose wainwrights party it is disgusting fred would not have had his share of human nature if he had not enjoyed the discomfiture of his haughty cousin he thinks this world was made for him he said to himself there would be no place for me in it if he had his will the brokers house was blazing with light and already many of the young guests had arrived plants and flowers were to be seen in profusion and the mansion wore a holiday look fred was dazzled but did not allow himself to appear ill at ease second floor back said the servant who admitted him fred went upstairs and arranged his toilet in the room appropriated to gentlemen three or four other boys were present but he knew no one with one of these an attractive boy of his own age fred stumbled into acquaintance and they went downstairs together come with me said the other boy we will pay our respects to rose together fred was glad to have some one take him in tow and said so adding wont you tell me your name my name is george swain i am a columbia schoolboy and mine fred fenton i am in mr wainwrights office rose greeted both boys cordially she glanced approvingly at freds dress she had been a little uncertain whether he would be able to appear in suitable costume you wont forget our dance she said smiling oh no i am counting upon it then put down your name here and she presented a card containing the order of dances may i put down my name too asked george certainly i shall be pleased to dance with you when his turn came fred acquitted himself very creditably thanks to his skilful instructor professor saville at ten oclock a series of tableaux was announced at one end of the diningroom a miniature stage had been erected and there was a circular row of footlights in the third tableau rose took part she incautiously drew too near the footlights and in an instant her dress caught fire there was a wild scene of excitement all seemed to have lost their presence of mind except fred occupying a front seat he jumped to his feet in an instant stripped off his coat and jumping on the stage wrapped it round the terrified rose chapter xxvi fred becomes a newspaper hero lie down instantly dont be alarmed i will save you said fred rapidly as he reached the girl he spoke in a tone of authority required by the emergency and rose obeyed without question her terror gave place to confidence in fred her prompt obedience saved her life a minutes delay and it would have been too late there was a wild rush to the stage first among those to reach fred and the little girl was mr wainwright he had seen his daughters peril and for a moment he had been spellbound his limbs refusing to act had fred been affected in the same way the life of rose would have been sacrificed are you much hurt my darling he asked sick with apprehension just a little papa answered rose cheerfully if it hadnt been for fred i dont know what would have happened the coat was carefully removed and it was found that the chief damage had been to the white dress the little girls injuries were of small account fortunately there was a physician present who took rose in hand and did what was needed to relieve her it is a miracle that she was saved mr wainwright he said but for this brave boy hush doctor i cannot bear to think of it said mr wainwright with a shudder i can never forget what you have done for me and mine he added turning to fred and wringing his hand i wont speak of it now but i shall always remember it fred blushed and tried to escape notice but the guests surrounded him and overwhelmed him with congratulations one little girl the intimate friend of rose even threw her arms round his neck and kissed him which caused fred to blush more furiously then ever but upon the whole he bore himself so modestly that he won golden opinions from all the incident put an end to the party as soon as it was understood that rose was in no danger the guests began to take their leave george swain and fred went out together fred you have shown yourself a hero said his friend warmly you would have done the same thing said fred perhaps i should but i should not have acted so promptly that was the important point you had your wits about you i was sitting beside you but before i had time to collect my thoughts you had saved rose i acted on the impulse of the moment how did you know just what to do making her lie down you know i read an account of a similar case some months since it came to me in a moment and i acted upon it if i ever catch fire i hope youll be on hand to put me out oh yes laughed fred ill stand you on your head directly thank you its a good thing to have a considerate friend did you have a pleasant evening fred asked mrs fenton are you not home earlier than you expected yes mother there was as an accident that broke up the party he described the affair but said nothing of his own part in it the next morning after fred had taken breakfast and gone to business a neighbor came in i congratulate you mrs fenton she said you have a right to be proud of fred thank you said the widow puzzled im glad you think well of him theres few boys that would have done what he did what has he done asked mrs fenton stopping short on her way to the pantry you dont mean to say you dont know why its in all the papers i am sure i dont know what you are talking about didnt i tell you how he saved the little girl from burning to death was it fred who saved her he didnt tell me that of course it was read that now she put in the hand of the widow a copy of the sun in which the whole scene was vividly described what do you say now mrs fenton that i am all the more proud of fred because he did not boast of what he did and a look of pride shone in the widows eyes that morning when raymond ferguson entered the breakfastroom rather later than usual he found his father reading a paragraph in the sun with every appearance of surprise what is it papa asked raymond read that raymond took the paper and his eye was drawn to some conspicuous headlines a narrow escape from a terrible death a brokers daughter in flames saved by a boys heroism a tragic scene at a new years party why its rose wainwright said raymond excitedly whom do you think i saw on his way to the party last evening fred fenton how did you hear it asked raymond in surprise read the account and you will understand this is what raymond read last evening a terrible tragedy came near being enacted at the house of the wellknown broker john wainwright the occasion was a juvenile party given by his little daughter rose eleven years of age one part of the entertainment provided was a series of tableaux upon a miniature stage at one end of the diningroom all went well till the third tableau in which the young hostess took part she incautiously approached too near the footlights when her white dress caught fire and instantly blazed up all present were spellbound and it seemed as if the little girls fate was sealed luckily one of the young guests fred fenton retained his coolness and presence of mind without an instants delay he sprang upon the stage directed the little girl to lie down and wrapped his coat around her thanks to his promptitude she escaped with slight injuries by the time the rest of those present recovered from the spell of terror rose was saved we understand that the brave boy who displayed such heroic qualities was formerly a train boy on the erie railroad but is now employed in the office of mr wainwright raymond read this account with lowering brow he felt sick with jealousy why had he not been lucky enough to receive an invitation to the party and enact the part of a deliverer he did not ask himself whether if the opportunity had been afforded he would have availed himself of it it is fortunate for rose that she had fred to depend upon in her terrible emergency and not raymond ferguson there was little that was heroic about him a hero must be unselfish and raymond was the incarnation of selfishness your cousin seems to have become quite a hero said mr ferguson as raymond looked up from the paper dont call him my cousin i dont care to own him i dont know said his father who was quite as selfish but not as malicious as raymond i am not sure but it will be considered a credit to us to have such a relative anybody could have done as much as he did said raymond in a tone of discontent heres some news of your trainboy luella he continued as his sister entered the room has he been arrested asked luella listlessly not at all he turns out to be a hero said her father i suppose that is a joke read the paper and see the young lady read the account with as little pleasure as raymond how on earth came a boy like that at the wainwrights house she said with a curl of the lip really society is getting very much mixed perhaps said her father it was his relationship to the future countess cattelli luella smiled complacently she had fallen in with an italian count an insignificant looking man very dark and with jet black hair and mustache of whom she knew very little except that he claimed to be a count she felt that he would propose soon and she had decided to accept him she did not pretend to love him but it would be such a triumph to be addressed as the countess cattelli she would let alfred lindsay see that she could do without him chapter xxvii a confidential mission when fred met mr wainwright at the office the next morning his employer greeted him with a pleasant smile but did not stop to speak fred felt relieved for it embarrassed him to be thanked and since the evening previous no one had met him without speaking of his heroism now fred was inclined to be modest and he could not possibly feel that he had done anything heroic though he was quite aware that he had saved the life of rose wainwright he looked upon it rather as a fortunate opportunity for rendering his employer a valuable service at one oclock fred took his hat intending to go to lunch he lunched at a quiet place in nassau street and never spent over twentyfive cents for this meal feeling that he must give the bulk of his salary to his mother he was just going out when he heard his name called looking back he saw that it was the broker himself who was speaking to him mr wainwright had his hat on and seemed about going out too you must go to lunch with me today fred thank you sir answered fred respectfully they walked through wall street together the broker chatting pleasantly on the way fred met raymond who stared in surprise and disgust as he saw the intimate terms on which fred appeared to be with his wealthy employer mr wainwright led the way into an expensive restaurant of a very select character and motioned fred to sit down at a table with him after the orders were given he said i have invited you to lunch with me as i could not speak at the office without being overheard of course the great service which you rendered me and mine last evening i can never forget i do not propose to pay you for it i am glad of that sir said fred earnestly i feel that money is entirely inadequate to express my gratitude but i shall lose no opportunity of advancing your interests and pushing you on in business thank you sir indeed it so happens that i have an opportunity even now of showing my confidence in you fred listened with increased attention some months since continued the broker a confidential clerk who had been employed in my office for years suddenly disappeared and with him about fifteen thousand dollars in money and securities as they were my property and no one else was involved i did not make the loss public thinking that i might stand a better chance of getting them back but sir i should think the securities would be sold and the amount realized spent well thought of but there was one hindrance they were not negotiable without the indorsement of the owner in whose name they stood yes sir i see sooner or later i expected to hear from them and i have done so yesterday this letter came to me from my defaulting clerk he placed a letter with a canadian postmark in freds hand shall i read it asked fred yes do so this was the letter mr wainwright dear sir i am ashamed to address you after the manner in which i have betrayed your confidence and robbed you but i do it in the hope of repairing to some extent the wrong i have committed and of restoring to you a large part of the stolen bonds if it depended on myself alone i should have little difficulty but i had a partner in my crime i may say indeed that i never should have robbed you had i not been instigated to it by another this man who calls himself paul bowman i made acquaintance with at a billiard saloon in new york he insinuated himself into my confidence inquired my salary denounced it as inadequate and finally induced me to take advantage of the confidence reposed in me to abstract the securities which you lost he had made all arrangements for my safe flight accompanying me of course we went to montreal first but this is so apt to be the refuge of defaulters that we finally came to the small village from which i address these lines there was a considerable sum of money which we spent also five hundred dollars in government bonds on which we realized the other securities we have not as yet been able to negotiate i have proposed to bowman to restore them to you by express and trust to your kindness to spare us a criminal prosecution and enable us to return to the states for which i have a homesick longing but he laughs the idea to scorn and has managed to spirit away the bonds and conceal them in some place unknown to me of course this makes me entirely dependent upon him to make matters worse i have fallen sick with rheumatism and am physically helpless if you could send here a confidential messenger who could ascertain the hidingplace of the bonds i would thankfully consent to his taking them back to you and i would make no conditions with you if you felt that you could repose confidence in me once more i would willingly return to your employment and make arrangements to pay you by degrees the value of the money thus far expended by bowman and myself there are still thirteen thousand five hundred dollars worth of securities left untouched in their original packages we are living in a small village called st victor thirty miles from the american line we occupy a small cottage rather out of the village and go by our own names do not write to me for the letter would be seen by paul bowman and defeat my plans but instruct your messenger to seek a private interview with me i am detained at home by sickness at present but bowman is away most of the day he is fond of hunting and spends considerable of the day in the woods while his evenings are spent at the inn where there is a pool table i have managed to send this to the post office by a small girl who comes here in the morning to make the bed and sweep hoping earnestly that this communication may reach you i sign myself your repentant clerk james sinclair fred read this letter with great interest he seems to write in good faith he said as he handed it back yes sinclair is not so wicked as weak i quite believe him when he says that it was bowman who instigated him to the deed do you think there is any chance of recovering the securities asked fred that depends upon whether i can secure a discreet and trustworthy messenger yes sir i suppose that is important perhaps you can suggest some one said the broker eying fred attentively fred shook his head i have too few acquaintances to think of anyone who would be fit he answered would you undertake it yourself asked mr wainwright i stammered fred in genuine surprise yes but dont you think i am too young perhaps your youth may be a recommendation i dont see how sir by drawing away suspicion from you should i send a man the appearance of a stranger in a small place like st victor i think it has little more than a thousand inhabitants would very likely excite the suspicions of this bowman and so defeat the chances of success yes sir i see that of course your youth presents this objection that you may not have the requisite judgment and knowledge of the world for so delicate a mission that is what i am afraid of sir still i have observed you closely and have found you prompt selfreliant and possessed of unusual good sense so upon the whole having no other person in my mind i have decided to send you to st victor if you will consent to go i will certainly go sir if you desire it and will do my best to succeed that is all that any one could do whatever might be his age and experience when will you be ready tomorrow if you wish it sir the sooner the better i shall provide you with ample funds to defray your expenses as to instructions i have none to give you must be guided by circumstances and fall back in times of perplexity upon your natural shrewdness now let us address ourselves to the dinner chapter xxviii st victor so this is st victor said fred as he got out of the train on the grand trunk railroad and looked about him curiously it was a small unpretending village composed entirely of frame houses of modest size and a few small stores kept as the signs indicated by frenchmen on a little elevation stood a wooden catholic church surmounted by a cross it seems a quiet place thought fred i shall find it dull enough but if i accomplish my purpose i wont complain of that he scarcely needed to inquire for the village inn for it was in plain sight not a hundred yards from the station as the town seemed to be peopled chiefly by french residents it would have been natural to conclude that the hotel also would be french this however was not the case for the lion inn there was a swinging signboard adorned by the figure of a lion the work of a fourthrate sign painter was kept by a short stout redfaced englishman who stood in the doorway as fred came up valise in hand is this the hotel asked fred yes sir was the reply i should like to stay with you for a while all right sir come right in and well accommodate you with a room have you had supper no i should like some for i am very hungry it shall be ready for you sir in a jiffy will am and heggs suit you sir yes i shall relish them james take the young gentlemans bag up to no i should like water and towels as i have had a long and dusty ride fred was ushered into a small bedroom on the second floor very plainly furnished but the train boy was not accustomed to luxurious accommodations and found it satisfactory he indulged himself in a thorough ablution then sat down at the window which was in the front of the house soon there was a knock at the door and the boy james made his appearance please sir your suppers ready he said and so am i returned fred with alacrity he descended to a small diningroom adjoining the bar it was not more than twelve feet square and from its size it might be inferred that the lion inn was seldom overrun with guests fred sat down at the table alone but presently a man of thirtyfive or thereabouts entered and took a seat opposite him good evening young man he said where do you come from good evening answered fred civilly i come from new york the other arched his brows so do i he said what sent you here to this outoftheway place theres good hunting hereabouts isnt there yes are you fond of hunting i like it pretty well ive just had a present of a handsome rifle it should be mentioned here that before fred left new york mr wainwright had given him a gun which would serve him as an excuse for his journey well go out together tomorrow my names bowman fred heard the name with a thrill of excitement why this must be the man referred to in sinclairs letter as having instigated him to the crime he surveyed bowman with attention taking stock of him so to speak he found him to be a man of middle height rather spare than stout with dark shifty eyes and a sallow complexion he wore a mustache but no whiskers i may find it worth while to get well acquainted with him thought fred i shall be glad to go out with you he said aloud thats all right but how does a boy like you happen to be traveling so far from home i have a vacation said fred i have never been in canada and thought it would be something new to come here im pretty tired of it i can tell you then why do you stay asked fred innocently my partners taken down with rheumatism and i cant leave him answered bowman in a tone of hesitation when he gets well i may go back to new york i doubt if you will thought fred were you in a business position in new york asked bowman i have been for some time train boy on the erie railroad answered fred feeling that it would never do to mention his connection with mr wainwright train boys dont usually have money to spend on vacation trips said bowman shrewdly thats true laughed fred if i had depended on my savings i shouldnt have been able to go farther than hoboken or coney island but a rich friend supplied me with a moderate sum for expenses then you were in luck fred was a little afraid that bowman would inquire the name of the rich friend and made up his mind that he would evade answering however his companion showed no curiosity on the subject will you take a glass of ale with me asked bowman as he filled his own glass from a bottle beside his plate no thank you i have no taste for it i didnt like it myself at first but ive come to like it does your partner board with you at the hotel asked fred no was the careless reply we have a small cottage just out of the village i wonder how he gets along for meals thought fred however that might be paul bowman didnt permit anxiety to interfere with his own appetite he did ample justice to the supper and so indeed did fred fortunately the ham and eggs were well cooked and the loaf of bread was fresh in place of ale fred contented himself with tea at length they rose from the table this is a beastly hole st victor i mean said bowman as he led the way to the readingroom but the eating is fair an englishman keeps the inn and though he has no french kickshaws on his table he gives you solid food and enough of it do you smoke i believe i have a cigar somewhere but i smoke a pipe myself thank you answered fred but i dont smoke i used to smoke cigarettes but a young man an acquaintance of mine died of cigarettesmoking so the doctor said and i gave it up smoking never hurt me that i know of said bowman even if it did whats a man to do in this dull hole shall you stay here long i dont know how long its a cheap place to stay in isnt it yes it has that recommendation then i may stay a week possibly said fred in an offhand way ive been here six weeks said bowman then you have had a chance to get well acquainted with st victor a good deal better than i want to be i was just getting ready to leave when my partner had a sharp attack of rheumatism is he from new york too no from philadelphia answered bowman cautiously though he had no suspicion that fred was other than he represented himself i have never been in philadelphia said fred indifferently what is your partners name james sinclair answered bowman after a moments hesitation have you ever heard that name before yes where i asked bowman quickly i had a schoolmate of that name oh yes i suppose the name is not an uncommon one do you play billiards i have seen it played there is a poor table in the house such as it is it may afford us a little recreation will you try a game yes if you will teach me fred felt that it was his policy to cultivate the acquaintance of mr bowman as it might afford him an opportunity to obtain the information he desired he had never played a game of billiards but he was willing to try it come in then said bowman he led the way into a room opposite the office where stood a venerablelooking billiard table probably twenty years old it had been given to the landlord some years before by a gentleman and it had seen hard service since then they played one game and were about to commence another when a small girl with black hair cut short entered the room monsieur bowman she said your friend would like to see you he feels quite bad plague take it said bowman pettishly i can do him no good but i suppose i shall have to go is it your partner asked fred yes if you dont mind i will walk over with you glad of your company claudine tell mr sinclair that i will be with him directly oui monsieur and the little girl vanished i wish sinclair would get well or something grumbled bowman as they walked to the lower end of the main street of the village its hard luck for me to be tied to a sick man still he has the worst of it suggested fred who was not altogether pleased with the cold selfishness of his companion yes i suppose so but it isnt right that i should suffer for his misfortune do you employ a doctor yes i called in a doctor once a frenchman dr st hilaire he left some medicines and sinclair takes them he doesnt seem to get better then at any rate he is very slow about it said bowman who spoke as if his unfortunate friend were in fault at last they reached the cottage it was very small containing three rooms and an attic bowman opened the door and entered what might perhaps be designated as the sittingroom though it contained a bed on which propped up by pillows lay james sinclair whats amiss with you sinclair grumbled bowman everything is amiss you have left me alone all day what good could i do you if i were here it would only mope me to death i have had nothing to eat since morning except a boiled egg why not couldnt you send claudine after food of what use would that be when i had no money to give her i warrant you have had your regular meals i took my meals at the hotel it was more convenient i warrant me you took care to provide for yourself at least give me some money so that i may not quite starve money money all the time do you know sinclair our stock is running very low i demand my share of it as long as it lasts you take advantage of my helplessness theres a dollar mind you make it last as long as possible said bowman it will be well to put off your complaints till another time for i have brought company he signaled to fred who had remained outside to enter and the boy did so he regarded the sick man with interest and sympathy not alone because he seemed in sorry plight and ill treated by his companion in crime but also because he was clearly the less guilty of the two and seemed disposed to make amends to the man whom he had wronged james sinclair unprepared for the advent of a boy regarded him with surprise who is this he asked my name is fred fenton answered the train boy remembering that bowman was as yet ignorant of his name he is a guest at the inn explained bowman carelessly he arrived tonight he will be some company for me in this dull hole we were playing a game of billiards when claudine broke in and told me you wanted to see me i expected to find you at the point of death he finished impatiently that may come sooner than you think said sinclair may i ask where you come from young man he added in a tone of suppressed eagerness which fred well understood i come from new york answered the boy trying to throw a degree of significance into this brief answer from new york said sinclair in some excitement and trying to read in freds face whether he was the expected messenger you have come for your health i suppose not exactly for that for my health is always good but i thought it might be a pleasant place to spend an unexpected holiday that has been granted me pleasant repeated bowman scornfully if you can find anything pleasant at st victor you will have greater luck than i is claudine in the kitchen asked the sick man claudine he called raising his voice yes monsieur answered the little handmaid appearing at the door go to the bakers and buy a loaf of bread here is money is there any tea left yes monsieur then buy a cupful of milk and half a pound of sugar i am almost famished a cup of tea and some toast will put new life into me claudine departed on her errand and sinclair once more fixed his eyes on fred there was a question he very much wished to ask but in bowmans presence he could not do it safely chapter xxix fred takes the first step and so you come from new york sinclair repeated for the want of something better to say when did you leave the city may i ask on tuesday then you came directly here yes i came directly here you must then have heard of st victor before starting yes yet i fancy it is so obscure that its existence can be known to very few in the great city i presume you are right i was recommended to come here by a friend ah commented james sinclair beginning to think he was right though it seemed to him very strange that mr wainwright should have selected so young a messenger i should like to see new york once more who wouldnt interposed bowman impatiently in new york you can live here in st victor one can only vegetate dont you expect to go back to new york some day mr sinclair asked fred i dont know i hope so when our business in canada is completed said bowman we shall probably both go back are you going to sleep here tonight bowman asked sinclair no i think not i have taken a room in the hotel you must do as you like of course but it is lonely for me besides i might need assistance let the girl stay here then i should make a miserable sick nurse i will ask young fenton here if it is reasonable to expect me to bury myself in such a cheerless place when it will do no good fred was disgusted with the mans selfishness if i had a friend sick he said i think i would be quite willing to keep him company you say so now but wait till the time comes your words mr fenton said sinclair embolden me to ask you a favor name it said fred in a tone of kindly encouragement i spend all my time alone except when claudine is ministering to my wants your time is hardly likely to be very much occupied in this dull place cant you spare me an hour or two at your convenience during the day you have promised to go hunting with me tomorrow interrupted bowman that is true i will go with you in the forenoon and in the afternoon i will call on mr sinclair bowman shrugged his shoulders it is a rash promise you will be sorry for having made it i will risk that answered fred sinclair gave him a grateful glance the promise cheered him and kindled hopes in his breast now he would have a chance of learning when alone with fred whether he came as a messenger from mr wainwright if so and through his means he could make restitution and regain his place and lost character he would still have something to live for he execrated his folly in weakly submitting to the guidance of paul bowman and for having taken that first step in crime which is so difficult to retrace dont forget your promise he said earnestly as fred rose to go i wont fail you replied fred quietly youre in for it now remarked bowman as they started to walk home you might as well turn sick nurse at once as give up your time to sinclair i might be sick sometime myself said fred and in that case i should be sorry to be left alone oh well suit yourself said bowman carelessly id rather it would be you than me for that matter i shall expect you to go out to the woods with me in the forenoon all right well thought fred as he slipped into bed at ten oclock ive made a beginning i have formed the acquaintance of both parties to the robbery the next step will be more difficult chapter xxx a hunting excursion fred did not rise till eight oclock the next morning he was fatigued by his long journey and slept late when he descended he found bowman seated at the breakfasttable i got ahead of you said bowman how long have you been downstairs about ten minutes are we likely to have a good day for hunting good enough answered bowman indifferently i am not an enthusiastic sportsman i only take to it to fill up a part of my time it is about the only thing i can do in this dull hole you might read i brought two or three novels in my valise and will lend yon one if you care for it i dont care for reading stories tire me i used to read the daily papers in new york but cant get hold of any here new york dailies i mean i dont care for canadian papers unless they contain news from new york i have with me the tribune world and sun of day before yesterday i should like to see them said bowman eagerly if you will bring them down i will look over them in the woods all right i am glad i saved them i had a mind to throw them away or leave them in the car the breakfast was plain but fred and bowman who were the only guests were not difficult to suit ten minutes later they were on their way to the woods they went across the fields taking a footpath trodden in the snow which materially shortened the distance but even tramping this far tired bowman and when they reached a small rock that cropped out from the expanse of white he declared that he must rest awhile he took a seat on the bowlder and began to read one of the papers he had brought with him five minutes later he uttered an exclamation of surprise fred looked at him inquiringly do you find news of any of your friends he asked yes teddy donovan has escaped from sing sing thats the bank burglar isnt it yes and one of the smartest men in the profession you know him then yes answered bowman i got acquainted with him some years ago of course he added feeling some explanation necessary i didnt know that he was a burglar till later poor fellow it is his only fault fred was privately of opinion that it was rather a serious fault hes a smart fellow bowman continued and he led the police a long chase before they nabbed him ive often urged him to turn over a new leaf and lead an honest life or hed fetch up in prison but he only laughed and that was all the good it did i wish teddy would find his way up here do you think he will be able to elude recapture well hes sharp enough for almost anything i suppose there are a good many men of his kind in canada said fred innocently yes replied bowman adding in a jocular tone i didnt know but that might have brought you here oh no laughed fred im as straight and honorable as you are good joke exclaimed bowman slapping his thigh shake bowman extended his hand and fred shook it though it was not clear to him what the joke was or why he should shake hands with his companion because they both happened to be straight and honorable the hunt was now begun for fred caught sight of a jack rabbit skimming across the snow he lifted his gun and was fortunate enough to bring his game down this fired bowman with the spirit of emulation and putting the papers back in his pocket he started off in search of a companion trophy to that of his young friend he did not find it until the extrain boy had knocked over two more bunnies and as fred continued to keep ahead of him in the amount of game bagged mr paul bowman soon became disgusted and proposed a return to the hotel where he would have an opportunity to finish his perusal of the new york papers by the readingroom stove as freds nose was being nipped by the frost and he felt that he had wrought sufficient destruction among the rabbit tribe he readily fell in with the suggestion half an hour later he was thawing himself out when bowman suddenly looked up from the world and asked abruptly did you ever hear of john wainwright the broker and banker fred was on his guard and answered cautiously yes i believe i have heard of him he has an office on broadway hasnt he no on wall street did you ever work for him no but an acquaintance of mine did said bowman carelessly hes got a pile of money i expect very likely most bankers have havent they i suppose so but theyre not in my line i used to be a dry goods clerk in new york no in baltimore i dont know anything about baltimore if bowman at any time entertained any suspicions about fred they were dissipated by his next remark i might like to go to baltimore to work would you recommend me to the firm you used to work for i believe they have gone out of business but youd better stick to new york youngster theres better chances there than in baltimore the gong for dinner now sounded and as their tramp through the snow had given them both good appetites they lost no time in answering its summons when dinner was over bowman asked what are you going to do with yourself this afternoon i promised to call on your friend in the cottage will you go with me not i i can fill up my time more agreeably you will find it awfully stupid very likely but i like to keep my promises the landlords going to ride to hyacinth about ten miles away on business hes invited me to ride with him i wish there were room in the sleigh for you i can put that off till another time i hope you will have a pleasant ride it will fill up the time anyway have you any message to your partner asked fred as he stood ready to start on his walk no tell him to get well as fast as he can so that we can get away from this beastly place thats all james sinclair was lying on the bed with a look of weariness on his face when fred pushed open the outer door and entered sinclairs face brightened up you didnt forget your promise mr fenton lie said no i always keep my promises when i can you are very kind to a poor sick man you have no idea how long the hours seem in this quiet cottage with no one to look at or speak to but claudine i can imagine it and claudine understands very little english most of the people in st victor as i suppose you know are french i judged this from the signs over the shops very few englishspeaking people find their way here it is for this reason that i was somewhat surprised to see you here i should not have come here returned fred pointedly if you had not been here you came here to see me ejaculated sinclair in excitement yes then you must come from mr wainwright yes i come from him in response to the letter which he received from you thank god said sinclair fervently chapter xxxi fred has an understanding with sinclair mr wainwright showed me the letter you wrote to him went on fred excuse me said sinclair looking puzzled but you seem very young to be taken into mr wainwrights confidence i am only seventeen i dont understand it nor do i answered fred smiling but mr wainwright is right in supposing that i will do my best for him does he give you full powers in this matter read this letter and you can judge for yourself the sick man eagerly held out his hand and read carefully the letter which fred placed in it it ran thus james sinclair the bearer of this letter has full powers to treat with you i am glad you realize the wrong you have done me and am prepared to consider your case in a generous spirit the theft is known only to those who committed it my young messenger and myself on the return of the bonds i will take you back into my employment john wainwright tears came to the eyes of sinclair how kind and considerate mr wainwright is he said in a tone of emotion read this letter you are right but i would do the same sinclair extended his hand which fred shook cordially i am not as bad as you may suppose it was bowman who by his artful hints and allurements induced me to rob my employer i have never ceased to repent it are you prepared to restore the bonds that will set you right when i wrote the letter i was prepared but now i must depend on you to find them you dont know where they are asked fred in dismay no you see that trunk at the other end of the room yes they were there until three days ago then bowman who kept the key opened the trunk in my presence and took out the package of bonds locking the trunk after him what are you doing i asked going to put these bonds into a place of security he answered are they not safe in the trunk i asked no he replied suppose during my absence a thief should enter the house you are confined to the bed by rheumatism what resistance could you make but that is very improbable i persisted i dont know about that this is a lonely cottage and might be entered at any time he rejoined where are you going to put the bonds i asked uneasily he evaded a reply but promised to tell me when i recovered my health i protested for we were jointly concerned in the robbery and half the proceeds belonged to me at any rate i had as much title to them as he but the contest was not an equal one had i been a well man i would have forcibly prevented his carrying out his purpose but what could i do racked with pain as i was and unable to sit up in bed i was worse off then than i am now so he carried off the bonds yes and i dont know where he carried them you see that complicates matters i do see answered fred perplexed and i dont see the way out of the difficulty have you any idea where he can have concealed the securities no do you think he would keep them in his room at the hotel it is just across the hall from mine on the second floor no i dont a hotel room would be a much less secure place than this cottage and bowman is a shrewd man that is true he has probably found some outside place of concealment where of course i can give you no hint but i would advise you to follow him watch his movements and learn what you can he will be sure to visit the place where the bonds are hidden from time to time if only to make sure that they are still safe then i shall have to do some detective work precisely i have read a good many detective stories but i dont know that any of them will help me in this matter there is one thing i am afraid of what is that you say bowman is a shrewd man he will be likely to find out that i am following him and become suspicions he would if you were a man but as you are a boy he wont be likely to think that you are interested in the matter mr wainwright was of opinion that i should be less likely to excite suspicion than a grown man the old man is smarter than i gave him credit for i see no other way than to follow your directions are you in much pain today no less than for some time i think it is my mental trouble that aggravates my physical malady now that you are here and something is to be done to right the wrong i have committed i am sure i shall rapidly recover were you with bowman this morning yes we went out in the woods together i had a few new york papers which he read with interest have you them with you asked sinclair eagerly you dont know how i hunger for home news yes i brought them along as i thought you might like to read them i will read them after you are gone now we will converse have you a family asked fred i am not a married man but i have a mother answered sinclair his eyes filling does she know of my disgrace no i was obliged to tell a falsehood and represent that i was going to canada on business i have been in constant dread that my crime would get into the papers and she would hear it poor mother i believe that it would kill her you didnt think of that when you took the bonds i thought of nothing bowman gave me no time to think what i did was done on the impulse of the moment without consideration oh if i had only stopped to think he concluded with a sigh for fred it was a great moral lesson he was honest by nature but there is no one who cannot be strengthened against temptation the sum taken by sinclair was large but it had not made him happy probably he had never been more miserable than in the interval that had elapsed since his theft judging between him and bowman fred felt sure that it was sinclair who had been weak and bowman who had been wicked now his only hope was to recover his lost position to get back to where he stood when he yielded to temptation and robbed a kind and considerate employer where is bowman this afternoon asked sinclair he told me he was going to ride to hyacinth with the landlord he seems to find time hanging heavy on his hands he is much better off than i am it is bad enough to be sick but when to this is added a burden of remorse you can imagine that my position is not enviable at five oclock fred rose from his chair and took his hat i must be going he said we have supper at the hotel at six and i may as well be punctual will you call again asked sinclair eagerly yes but perhaps i had better not spend too much time with you it may give rise to suspicions on the part of your partner dont call him my partner i dont want to admit any connection between us there has been a connection it is true but as soon as i can bring it about it will be closed and then i hope never to see or hear of paul bowman as long as i live i shall get to work tomorrow said fred i think it will be best for me not to call here till the day after we must not appear to be too intimate when fred returned to the hotel he found bowman just arrived where have you been all the afternoon asked bowman part of the time i spent with your friend mr sinclair what did he find to talk about asked bowman eying fred sharply chiefly about new york and his health he doesnt seem contented here no wonder its the dullest hole i was ever in is he any better he thinks so i wish hed get well quick i want to go to some larger place i suppose montreal is a more interesting town yes there is something going on there we were fools to leave it after supper fred played a few games of billiards with bowman evidently he was not suspected as yet chapter xxxii finding a clew the object which fred had in view now was to ascertain where bowman had hidden the securities taken from the trunk in sinclairs cottage precisely how to set about it he did not know he had never had any experience in detective work and had only his native shrewdness to depend upon it occurred to him however that bowman would be likely from time to time to visit the place where he had secreted the bonds in order to make sure that they were safe this he was hardly likely to do when in freds company but only when alone when therefore he should see bowman starting off on a solitary expedition he decided if possible to follow him do you feel like going out on the river this morning asked bowman as they rose from breakfast i dont mind it will help to fill up the time for many years such an open winter had not been known the unusual warmth had left the lake as free from ice as in the early fall but for a slight covering of snow there would have been nothing to indicate that it was winter your vacation is likely to be a slow one here suggested bowman yes st victor isnt a very lively place i wonder you are willing to stay here said bowman with momentary suspicion i have so much excitement in new york and in my daily rides on the erie road that i dont mind the dulness as much as many would still if you and mr sinclair were not here i should cut short my visit at once bowman did not understand the hidden meaning of this speech and naturally interpreted it in a sense complimentary to himself sinclair isnt much company he said he is down in the dumps on account of his rheumatism i suppose he thinks i ought to stay in the cottage with him but i couldnt stand it i suppose you are in business together observed fred innocently did he say so not exactly but i inferred from what he did say that you had some business connection yes answered bowman hesitatingly we have a joint investment i dont think however that we shall remain connected long he doesnt suit me he is too slow and cautious fred did not think it necessary to comment on this statement they went down to the lake and were soon rowing to the middle of it here they tried fishing but did not meet with much success they gave it up and rowed across to the opposite side will you take charge of the boat for half an hour asked bowman turning to fred i am going on shore certainly if you wish it i have a fancy for exploring these woods i would invite you to go with me but the boat might be taken and that would subject us to some inconvenience i would just as soon stay here said fred carelessly then its all right fred watched bowman as he made his way in among the trees and it struck him at once that ha had secreted the bonds somewhere in the neighborhood and was about to visit the hidingplace if i could only leave the boat and follow him he said to himself eagerly but he decided at once that this would never do it would inevitably excite bowmans suspicion and then his chance of success would be wholly gone he must be cautious at all hazards he did not return to the middle of the lake but rowed lazily along the shore from time to time directing a glance toward the woods tomorrow i will make an excuse for not going with bowman and will come out here and do a little exploring myself he resolved at one point his attention was drawn to a boy who was sitting under a tree near the edge of the water may i get into your boat he asked for a short time a gentleman is with me who has gone on shore for a little while i know ive seen him here often have you asked fred with interest so he comes here a good deal does he yes he comes here mostly alone and goes into the woods once me and another boy got into the boat and rowed while he was gone i suppose he enjoys walking in the woods it aint that said the boy significantly what is it then asked fred trying to repress his excitement i think hes got business in the woods what business can he have there i think hes got something hidden there what makes you think so you wont tell him what i say will you i saw him when he first came here he had a bundle done up in paper he left the boat and went into the woods and when he came back he didnt have the paper he may have had it in his pocket no he didnt it was a big package and if it had been in his pocket it would have made it bulge out i see you are quite an observing boy i dare say you are right what do you think there was in the package i guess it was money if i had a lot of money i wouldnt hide it in the woods nor i answered fred laughing id buy a trunk and keep it inside somebody might open the trunk any way it would be safer than hiding it in the woods i dont know but you are right i hope the time will come when you and i will have a lot of money to conceal is the man a friend of yours asked the boy we are boarding at the same hotel i have only known mr bowman two days is he from the states yes i believe he came from new york where do you come from i live in new york too id like to see new york id go there if my father would let me i am not sure but you are better off here some boys have a hard time making a living in new york i thought everybody in new york was rich if you ever come to new york youll find out your mistake rejoined fred laughing if you aint a friend of mr bowman as you call him said the boy lowering his vice ill tell you something i wish you would mr bowman is not a friend of mine but there is no one else to keep company with so i go round with him i know where he has hidden his money is this true asked fred in excitement yes but how did you find out one day i followed him i dodged behind trees and kept out of sight once he came near seeing me when he looked back but i was just in time by and by he came to the place what sort of a place did i say i would tell you asked the boy shrewdly no but i will make it worth your while the boy eyed fred with suspicion and his manner became cold do you want to rob him he asked no then why do you want to know where he has hid his money fred deliberated hurriedly there was no way except to take the boy into his confidence i see you are an honest boy he said and i like you better for it thats all right but why do you want me to tell you where mr bowman has hidden his money can you keep a secret is there a secret yes the package which this man has hidden contains bonds which he stole from a new york banker how do you know that because i am sent to get them back if possible that is why i have come to st victor and that is why i have formed the acquaintance of mr bowman is this true asked the boy not wholly without suspicion listen and i will tell you the story i must be quick for mr bowman may be back any minute there he is now meet me tomorrow at ten in the morning just back of the place where you were sitting when i took you on board the boat and i will tell you all in the name of mr wainwright i will agree to pay you a hundred dollars if by your help i recover the bonds its a bargain said the boy his eyes sparkling chapter xxxiii success who is that boy asked bowman carelessly as he reentered the boat i dont know he asked me to take him for a little row and i was glad to have him for company i have been taking a stroll through the woods in fact i was brought up in the woods said bowman with a laugh fred understood that he was trying to give a plausible explanation of his absence i like the woods myself he rejoined do they extend far not very far i enjoyed my stroll in among the trees even barren as they are now of leaves very much it brought back to my mind my schoolboy days bowman seemed in quite good spirits evidently he had found that his secret hidingplace had not been discovered how much longer are you going to stay in st victor he asked after a pause i dont know answered fred slowly i may take a fancy to go away any day i wish i could go too i am tired of this place i suppose you are waiting for mr sinclair to recover yes answered bowman but there was hesitation in his tone a sudden suspicion entered freds mind was bowman meditating giving his confederate the slip and deserting him taking the bonds with him had he perhaps taken the package from its hidingplace and got it concealed about his person a careful scrutiny satisfied fred that this was not the case but it was quite possible that he would make another visit the next day and remove the bonds then i must lose no time he thought or i shall lose my opportunity they reached the hotel in time for dinner what are you going to do this afternoon asked bowman i havent thought particularly answered fred indifferently suppose we play poker the landlord has a pack of cards i dont know the game it wont take long to learn i will show you how it is played i dont care for cards i may call on mr sinclair bowman shrugged his shoulders you must enjoy his society he said i dont go there for enjoyment my visit may cheer the poor man all right ill see if the landlord isnt going to drive somewhere i hope he is thought fred it will get bowman out of the way about halfpast two bowman entered the public room where fred was reading im going for a drive he announced ill see you at supper very well fred waited till bowman drove out of the yard and then taking his gun went off himself but he did not turn his steps in the direction of sinclairs cottage he had ascertained that there was a way of going by land to that part of the woods where he had met his young companion of the morning he had made up his mind to repair to the spot now on the chance of finding the boy and securing the bonds that very afternoon he felt that there was no time to be lost it would have been easier and shorter to take the boat and the landlord would have made no objection but some one might see him out on the lake and this would excite bowmans suspicions especially when he discovered that the bonds were missing so fred chose the land route as the wiser one to take under the circumstances the distance was quite two miles but fred did not mind that the prize for which he was striving was too great for him to shrink from such a trifle as that he reached the other side of the pond but no one was in sight he walked about anxiously looking here and there i hope i shall not have my walk for nothing he said to himself but luck was in his favor walking at random he all at once heard a boys whistle he quickened his steps and almost directly to his great delight he recognized sauntering along the very lad he had taken out in the boat in the morning hallo there he cried the boy turned quickly oh its you is it yes i thought you were to meet me tomorrow morning so i was but i did not dare to wait i think bowman will get the bonds tomorrow and make a bolt of it then what do you propose to do i want you to get the package for me today do you think i will get into any trouble asked the boy cautiously it wont be stealing will it it would be if the bonds were bowmans but they are not they belong to a rich banker in new york as i have already told you and in showing me where they are you are aiding justice will i get the hundred dollars sure yes i will guarantee that what is your name john parton i will take it down as soon as i get back to new york i will see that the money is sent you ill chance it said the boy you look honest and i believe you go on then and i will follow you john led the way into the thickest part of the wood he paused in front of a large tree partly gone to decay the trunk was hollow containing a large cavity the package is there he said get it for me returned fred and there your task will end i will undertake the rest in less than five minutes the package was placed in freds hands he opened his vest and placed it inside carefully pinning it to the waistcoat so that it might not slip down it will be awkward to carry he said on account of its size i wish it were safe in mr wainwrights possession then a new idea came to him is there any express office near here he asked the nearest is at hyacinth five or six miles away i should like to go there do you know where i can hire a team we are not using ours today said john then said fred promptly i will hire it paying any price your father considers satisfactory and i will engage you to drive me over you know the way ive been there hundreds of times then it is all right do you think we can have the team ill pay two dollars for that and a dollar for your services as driver its a go come right along our house is less than half a mile away then the two boys emerged from the woods and made their way to a comfortable farmhouse situated in the midst of fertile fields john went into the house and presently came out with his mother are you the young man that wants to go to hyacinth she asked yes maam well i dont know of any objection dont stay too long ill be back in time for supper mother did your mother ask you what i was going for asked fred no i told her you wanted to take a ride that will answer i wish there was enough snow left for sleighing the horse was quickly harnessed to an open buggy and the two boys got in john took the reins and turned out of the yard soon they were speeding over the road that led to hyacinth it was a pleasant drive but fred was too much occupied by thoughts of what he carried to pay much attention to the scenery at length they turned into the principal street of hyacinth the express office was just across the way from the railway depot fred entered and inquired how soon will a package start for new york in about an hour as it is valuable i will get you to put it up securely and seal it very well the agent wrapped it up in some thick brown paper gave it to fred to direct and then laid it carefully away do you wish to insure it he asked what is the value i will insure it for five hundred dollars fred knew that this would secure extra care and he did not care to name the real worth lest it might tempt some employee to dishonesty now he said as they left the office i feel easy in my mind but when the boys were half way home they overtook another buggy containing two occupants one of them was the landlord of the lion inn the other was paul bowman chapter xxxiv bowmans panic paul bowman who was driving the landlord having given up the reins to him checked the horse and hailed fred in evident surprise where have you been he inquired abruptly i have been to ride answered fred with an appearance of unconcern i thought you were going to call on sinclair so i was but after you left i decided to take a walk in another direction i met john and engaged him to take me to drive are you going home now yes i think so can you take me to the hotel john yes answered his companion readily then we will follow along behind mr bowman of course there could be no private conversation so john and he spoke on indifferent topics when they reached the hotel fred jumped from the buggy goodby john he said you will hear from me soon he added in a significant tone then he joined bowman who was wholly unsuspicious of the disaster that had befallen him i should like to go over to sinclairs thought fred but i suppose bowman will expect me to keep him company but in this he was agreeably disappointed at seven oclock the landlord drove round and bowman sprang into the buggy sorry to leave you fred he said but we are going to vaudry on a little business hope you wont be lonely never mind me mr bowman i think i will go over to see mr sinclair he will probably expect me have you any message bowman looked significantly at the landlord tell him i will call tomorrow or next day he said at present i am very busy the two drove away leaving fred and a stable boy named jack looking after them hes going to skip tomorrow said jack confidentially who mr bowman how do you know asked fred in excitement i heard him say so to the boss he doesnt want you to know it why not he is afraid you will tell his partner the sick man fred whistled that is news he said i suspected it might be so but didnt know for sure shall you tell mr sinclair yes i think i ought to do so thats so hes a nicer man than old bowman fred immersed in thought walked over to the cottage james sinclair received him with evident joy i expected you this afternoon he said the hours seemed very long i was employed on very important business said fred significantly you dont mean i mean said fred bending over and whispering in the sick mans ear that i have found the bonds where are they on the way to new york by express what a burden off my heart ejaculated sinclair fervently tell me about it he added after a pause fred did so now he added there will be nothing to prevent your coming to new york and taking your old place i think i shall recover now responded sinclair your news makes me feel fifty per cent better i have more news for you what is it bowman is planning to leave st victor tomorrow without a word to you he means to leave you in the lurch he can go now i shall be glad to part with him and forever that is his intention but when he finds the bonds have disappeared i dont know what he may decide to do when do you mean to start for new york i would start tonight if i could you can there is a train which passes through st victor at ten oclock this evening but no on second thought it goes to ottawa i dont care where it goes i dont wish to remain in st victor any longer than is absolutely necessary besides if bowman suspects and follows me he will be likely to think i have gone in a different direction i am sorry to have you go mr fenton we shall meet again soon i hope in new york fred reached the inn at nine oclock left the amount of his bill in an envelope with the boy jack and walked over to the station where he purchased a ticket for ottawa while he was in the depot building bowman and the landlord drove by before they had reached the inn the train came up and fred entered the rear car he breathed a sigh of relief as the cars quickened their speed and st victor faded in the distance meanwhile bowman and the landlord reached the hotel jack the stableboy came forward and took charge of the team here is a letter for you mr bluff he said a letter repeated the landlord with a look of wonder he opened it and uttered a cry of surprise the boys gone he ejaculated what boy asked bowman not suspecting the truth young fenton gone away what do you mean read that he passed the note to bowman who read as follows dear sir i am called away on business i enclose the amount due you if it is not right i will communicate with you as soon as i have reached new york remember me to mr bowman fred fenton called away on business repeated bowman suspiciously that is queer what did the boy say he asked of jack when did he first speak of going away i think he made up his mind sudden sir did he say where he was going he said he was goin back to new york received a summons from his employer i suppose very likely sir do you know if he went to see mr sinclair yes sir he went fust part of the evenin then sinclair can tell me about it very likely sir not daring to take jack too deeply into his confidence fred had told him that he was going to new york which was true or would be very shortly if he had waited till tomorrow we might have gone together thought bowman at least a part of the way it will be some time before i shall dare to set foot in new york bowman went to bed with a vague feeling of uneasiness for which he could not account he felt that it would be impossible for him to remain in the dull little village any longer should he or should he not go to see sinclair before he went away on the whole he resolved to secure the bonds first and then decide the next day after breakfast he strolled down to the lake got out the boat and rowed rapidly toward the farther shore there was no time to waste now he tied the boat to a sapling growing close to the bank and struck into the woods he made his way at once to the tree which he had used as a safe deposit vault and with perfect confidence thrust in his hand but the package which his fingers sought for seemed to have slipped out of reach he continued his search anxiously with increasing alarm but in vain a terrible fear assailed him he peered in through the cavity but neither sight nor touch availed gradually the terrible thought was confirmed the parcel had been stolen thirteen thousand five hundred dollars nearly the entire proceeds of his crime had vanished but where he staggered to a stump close by and sitting down buried his face in his hands what was he to do he had but twentyfive dollars left who can have taken it he asked himself with feverish agitation he rose and made his way mechanically back to the boat an hour later he staggered into the little cottage occupied by his sick partner his hair was disheveled his manner wild what is the matter bowman asked sinclair we are ruined said bowman in a hollow voice the bonds are gone when did you miss them asked sinclair quickly today they were safe yesterday do you think it was the boy what could he know of the bonds did you ever speak to him about them of course not what shall i do inquire whether any one has been seen near the place where you hid them do your best to recover them this advice struck bowman favorably he devoted the remainder of the day to the inquiry but learned nothing there was no further occasion to remain in st victor he left the inn in the evening forgetting to pay his reckoning chapter xxxv freds reward john wainwright the wealthy banker sat in his office looking over the letters that had come by the morning mail some of them he turned over to his confidential clerk to answer others more important he reserved to reply to with his own hand busy wainwright asked a gentleman arthur henderson entering without ceremony i always have something in hand but i have time enough for an old friend by the way have you heard anything of the bonds you lost some time since i know where they are you do yes they are in canada henderson laughed that means that you will never get them back i dont know i have sent a messenger to recover them who is it my office boy henderson stared i suppose that is a joke by no means what is the age of your office boy i should judge from his appearance that he is sixteen do you mean to say that you have intrusted a boy of sixteen with so important a commission i do really wainwright i dont like to criticise but it appears to me that you have taken leave of your senses the banker laughed goodhumoredly perhaps i ought not to be surprised at that then you acknowledge your lack of wisdom by no means what i have done i would do again couldnt you find a more suitable messenger not readily it would have been worth while to go yourself as the amount is considerable that would never have answered i should be recognized and excite suspicion do you really expect that boy to recover the bonds i think it possible at any rate suppose he does what is to hinder his keeping them himself his honesty pardon me wainwright but i have had a pretty extensive experience and i would be willing to wager ten to one that you will never see your bonds again i never bet and hold that betting is no argument but i too have had some experience of men and consider my chance of recovering the stolen property fairly good how long since your messenger started on his expedition about two weeks have you heard from him yes once there are reasons why it is imprudent for him to write too often henderson smiled significantly i dare say he is having a good time at your expense what was the amount of your loss about fifteen thousand dollars since you wont bet i will make you a proposal if the boy recovers your bonds and restores them to you i will offer him a place in my own countingroom at twenty dollars a week i dont think in that case i should be willing to lose his services i would pay him as much as he could get elsewhere there is very little chance of my being called upon to redeem my promise at that moment an express messenger entered the office here is a parcel for you sir he said it was a small package wrapped in brown paper carefully tied and sealed john wainwright paid the express charges receipted for the package and then eagerly opened it it was the same package which fred had expressed from hyacinth the bankers eyes were full of triumph what do you say to that my friend he asked what is it the missing bonds nothing could have happened more apropos you dont mean to say listen let me read you this letter from the messenger you thought me foolish in sending to canada here is a copy of freds letter john wainwright esq my dear sir i have at length recovered the bonds which were stolen from you and send them by express herewith i have not time to go into details but will only say that i found them in a hollow tree i secured them in the nick of time for i have reason to think that tomorrow they would have been removed by bowman who has got tired of st victor and will probably leave the neighborhood tomorrow i do not dare to keep the bonds in my possession as i may be followed but consider it safer to express them to you at once i shall go back to new york by a roundabout way but shall probably arrive very nearly as soon as the package yours respectfully fred fenton p s the money and u s bonds have been used but you will find in other securities in this package they would have been spent too but the holder found it impossible to negotiate them there henderson what do you think of that asked mr wainwright in a quiet tone of triumph i was a fool was i to trust this boy i dont know what to say but my offer holds good if you will release the boy i will take him into my employment at twenty dollars a week i will give him as much as he can get elsewhere repeated the banker there was a quick step heard outside and fred fenton entered the office good morning mr wainwright he said did you receive the package it just reached me fred shake hands my boy you have justified my confidence in you i did my best sir tell me all about it my curiosity is excited fred gave a rapid account of his adventures in search of the missing bonds it was listened to with equal interest by the banker and his friend wainwright introduce me said henderson abruptly fred said the banker smiling let me make you acquainted with my friend arthur henderson he is a commission merchant he may have a proposal to make to you young man if you will enter my employment i will pay you twenty dollars a week said merchant fred looked amazed that is a great deal more than i am worth said then you accept fred looked wistfully at mr wainwright i should not like to leave mr wainwright he said especially as he has raised your pay to twentyfive dollars a week said the banker smiling you cant be in earnest sir when you get your first weeks salary on saturday you will see that i am in earnest i see then that i must do without you said the merchant wainwright i take back all i said i advise you to keep fred by all means as long as he will stay with you the banker had opened his check book and was writing out a check he tore it from the book and handed it to fred it ran thus no park national bank pay to the order of fred fenton one thousand dollars john wainwright is this for me asked fred in amazement yes i ought perhaps to make it more for it is less than ten per cent of the value of the bonds how can i thank you sir ejaculated fred feeling uncertain whether he was awake or dreaming i feel like a millionaire have you been home yet fred no sir i came here at once go home then and spend the rest of the day with your mother do you want to cash the check this morning no sir indorse it then and i will hand you the money in bills tomorrow fred his face radiant with joy left the office and going to the nearest station on the sixth avenue elevated road bought a ticket and rode up town there a surprise awaited him chapter xxxvi a letter from tom sloan when fred presented himself at home after a fortnights absence his mother and little brother were overjoyed its been awfully lonely since you went away fred said albert i have felt like albert said mrs fenton but it was not that that worried me most i was afraid you might meet with some accident ive come home safe and sound mother as you see but you dont ask me whether i succeeded in my mission i dont know what your mission was no it was a secret of mr wainwrights and i was bound to keep it secret i can tell you now i was sent to canada to recover over ten thousand dollars worth of stolen bonds mrs fenton looked amazed a boy like you she said i dont wonder you are surprised i was surprised myself but who had the bonds and how did you recover them two men were in the conspiracy one of them was sorry for the theft and ready to help me the other meant to keep them he had taken them away from his partner and hidden them in the forest and you found them yes sit down and i will tell you the story fred did so and when it was finished he added how much do you think mr wainwright paid me for my trouble he ought to pay you handsomely what would you consider paying me handsomely fifty dollars answered his mother he gave me a thousand dollars a thousand ejaculated mrs fenton incredulous yes wheres the money asked albert he gave it to me in a check i shall collect it tomorrow and invest it in some safe way i cant realize it fred said mrs fenton why it will make us rich but that isnt all my salary is raised to twentyfive dollars a week i never heard of such wages being given to a boy like you it was my second offer this morning a merchant a friend of mr wainwright offered me twenty dollars to go into his office that is better than being a train boy fred yes but i was glad to work on the trains when i had nothing better to do just then the peculiar whistle of the postman was heard run downstairs albert and see if there are any letters for us said fred the little boy returned in a moment with an envelope directed to fred fenton and postmarked central city colorado he opened it hastily and exclaimed this is from mr sloan who visited us a few months since read it fred the letter was written in rather an illegible hand and the spelling was rather eccentric for mr sloan was not a scholar as corrected it ran thus friend fred i suppose you havent forgotten your old friend tom sloan i have often thought of how i enjoyed myself at your home and wished i could call in and take a cup of tea with you and your mother about that land you asked me to see ive got good news for you theres a town built around it and the price has gone up to fancy figures theres a party here that wants to buy it for five thousand dollars but i think i can get a little more if your mother will send me a power of attorney i will sell it and send you on the money ill do my best for you no wonder that old skinflint your uncle wanted to buy it hed have made a big thing out of it he was a fool not to take it at your own figures i hope you are all well and i shouldnt wonder if i might see you pretty soon ive been lucky myself and made a respectable pile old tom sloan doesnt get left if he can help it well goodby send on the power of attorney by return of mail yours till death tom sloan five thousand dollars ejaculated mrs fenton i cant believe it you will mother when you get the money theres no time to be lost ill go out at once and get the power of attorney and well write at once telling mr sloan to do whatever he thinks best do you agree to that mother yes fred he is a good man and i trust him entirely chapter xxxvii cousin ferguson in a fortnight fred received from colorado an order on a new york banker for six thousand five hundred dollars being the purchase money on the colorado lands he at once carried it to mr wainwright and invested it in securities recommended by that gentleman i congratulate you heartily fred said the banker i didnt know that i was taking into my employ a young man of fortune it has come upon me so suddenly that i cant realize it myself i consider you worthy of your good luck my boy you ought to save up money out of your wages i intend to sir but i am going to give my mother a better home now that i can afford it and will see that my little brother has a better education than i have had it is not too late to supply the deficiency in your own case you cannot do better than join the evening classes of the young mens christian association and do what you can to improve yourself i will follow your advice mr wainwright now that i am no longer anxious about money matters i want to qualify myself for a better social position only two days after the receipt of the money from colorado another letter as unexpected as mr sloans reached mrs fenton the substance of it was comprised in the closing paragraph send your son round to my house this evening i am prepared to make you a better offer for the colorado laud its of little value but some day may be worth more than at present as you are straitened in means i can better afford to wait than you and i shall feel satisfaction in relieving your necessities fred read this letter attentively i hate a hypocrite he said mr ferguson pretends that he wants to help us while he is scheming to cheat us out of a large sum relying upon our ignorance of the increased value of the land shall i write and tell him that we have sold the land asked mrs fenton no i will call and see him this evening as he requests but it will do no good i want to find out how much he is willing to give i shant let him know that the land is sold till he has made an offer dont say anything to provoke cousin ferguson fred dont worry mother i will be perfectly respectful about halfpast seven fred rang the bell at the door of the house on east thirtyninth street evidently he was expected for on his inquiring for mr ferguson he was shown at once into the presence of his rich relation good evening frederick said mr ferguson with unusual graciousness how is your mother very well thank you sir i hope you are getting along comfortably yes sir we have no right to complain that is well said mr ferguson condescendingly i presume the boy is making five dollars a week or some such matter he soliloquized that is very well for a boy like him i made you an offer for your fathers land in colorado a few months ago he went on carelessly yes sir you thought my offer too small yes sir twentyfive dollars would be of very little value to us there i disagree with you twentyfive dollars to a family situated as yours is is no trifle a faint smile flickered over freds face he wondered what mr ferguson would say if he knew precisely how they were situated still resumed the merchant you did right to refuse i am inclined to think the land is a little more valuable than i supposed fred was rather surprised was cousin ferguson going to act a liberal part and offer anything like a fair price for the land he waited curiously to hear what he would say next yes continued mr ferguson magnanimously i admit that i offered you too little for your land so i thought at the time sir fred said quietly and i am now prepared to rectify my mistake you may tell your mother that i will give her a hundred dollars for it a hundred dollars yes that is probably more than it is worth at present but i can afford to wait until it increases in value mr ferguson sat back in his armchair and fixed his eyes on fred with the air of one who has made a most generous offer did your mother authorize you to make a bargain he inquired no sir she wished you to report to her i suppose this offer will hold good for twentyfour hours you can come around tomorrow evening and the matter can be settled at once it may be well for your mother to come round also as her signature will be required to the bill of sale i am sorry to disappoint you mr ferguson but i dont think we will sell young man said ferguson severely if you advise your mother to reject this offer you will take upon yourself a great responsibility mr ferguson rejoined fred fixing his eyes on the merchant do you advise my mother as a friend to accept this offer of course of course it is the best thing she can do i have no right to doubt your sincerity but i think the land is worth more than you offer what can you know about it demanded ferguson impatiently a gentleman who had traveled in colorado called on us a while ago he seems to think the land is quite valuable stuff and nonsense the man was humbugging you he was a miner continued fred placidly he promised to look up the matter for us you were very rash to trust a stranger the best thing you can do is to disregard any advice he may have given you and accept my offer there is one difficulty in the way said fred what is that we have sold the land chapter xxxviii conclusion you have sold the land repeated mr ferguson in dismay yes sir then permit me to say that you and your mother have acted like fools said ferguson harshly in a matter like this you should have consulted me what do you or your mother know about business i think we did pretty well said fred placidly what did you sell for asked ferguson abruptly six thousand five hundred dollars answered the extrain boy robert ferguson stared at fred in amazement and incredulity dont play any of your practical jokes on me he said sternly i dont intend to sir we gave mr sloan a power of attorney and he sold it for us he says he did sneered ferguson you will never get the money excuse me mr ferguson we have received the money already when gasped the merchant two days ago the face of robert ferguson was a study disappointed cupidity succeeded his first incredulity he began to consider that he must convince fred that he had acted in good faith with an effort he smoothed down his face and conjured up a smile you quite take my breath away he said i can hardly believe that the land which i thought worthless should have realized such a sum have any mines been discovered on them no sir but a village has sprung up in the immediate neighborhood i am heartily glad of it tell your mother so how could i have been so deceived by the way it will be best for you to put the money in the hands of some responsible person to take care of for you as a near relative i shall be glad to invest the amount for you safely along with my own thank you sir but we have already invested it mr ferguson frowned i predict that you will lose half of it he said i dont think so i had advice in the investment who advised you john wainwright the banker do you know him yes he is my employer i believe i remember that raymond told me so of course he is a good adviser how much does he pay you twentyfive dollars a week do you take me for a fool demanded ferguson angrily no sir and you have no right to take me for a liar answered fred firmly but such a salary for a boy of sixteen is ridiculous it does seem so but mr wainwright sent me to canada to recover over ten thousand dollars worth of stolen bonds and i succeeded in bringing them back slowly it dawned upon mr ferguson that the youth before him was not only a favorite of fortune out a remarkably smart boy he was evidently on the rise would it not be politic to take notice of him fred he said with sudden friendliness i am pleased to hear of your good fortune you have done credit to the family we ought to be more intimate in proof of my desire for closer relations i shall send cards to you and your mother for my daughter luellas wedding she is to be married next thursday evening to an italian count probably you have suitable attire or if not you can easily obtain it give me your address thank you sir i am not sure whether my mother will attend but i shall be happy to do so the door opened and raymond ferguson entered good evening raymond said fred pleasantly good evening answered raymond coldly your cousin frederick has been very fortunate said the elder ferguson genially he and his mother have come into some thousands of dollars and he is receiving a handsome salary from mr wainwright the banker i shall be glad to see you two intimate is that so asked raymond thawing i am glad to say it is answered fred would you like to invite your cousin to attend the theater raymond just what i was going to ask there is a good play on at wallacks very well here is a fivedollar bill come along fred said raymond who had made up his mind it would be wise to cultivate the acquaintance of his once despised relative before they parted for the evening raymond borrowed five dollars of fred and struck up a close friendship with him while fred understood perfectly well what had produced this remarkable change in his cousin he was philosophical enough to take the world as he found it and accepted raymonds advances the next day wedding cards elaborately engraved were received at freds modest home requesting mrs fenton and her sons presence at the marriage ceremony of luella ferguson and count vincento cattelli but an unexpected circumstance prevented the nuptials from being celebrated one evening the count and miss ferguson were sitting at supper at delmonicos at a table near by sat a gentleman who watched the young couple with curious attention he rose finally and approached them miss ferguson i believe he said yes sir i dont know if you remember me but i dined at your fathers house one evening in february my name is stanwood i remember you now mr stanwood let me make you acquainted with count cattelli i am honored said stanwood with a curious smile this lady is my affianced bride said the count indeed i congratulate you by the way havent i met you before if you have been in italy sare i am count cattelli of milan stanwood smiled slightly and returned to his own table the next day miss ferguson received the following note my dear miss ferguson what i am about to write will pain you but i cannot permit you to be grossly deceived the gentleman whom you introduced to me as count cattelli at delmonicos last evening shaved me last march in a barbershop in chicago he may be a count but i advise you to speak to your father on the subject your well wisher charles stanwood miss ferguson went into a fit of hysterics but followed the advice of her correspondent the count on being taxed with his deception first indulged in bravado but finally acknowledged that he had served as a barber but still claimed to be a count mr ferguson intensely mortified agreed to give him two hundred dollars if he would leave the city at once notices that the wedding had been indefinitely postponed were sent to all who had received cards and luella disappeared for a time there were numerous reports as to the cause of the marriage being postponed but the secret was well kept luella is still unmarried and is likely to remain so unless some one marries her for her money ruth patton is now the wife of alfred lindsay the young lawyer made a private call on mr ferguson which resulted in the latter disgorging the ten thousand dollars of which he had defrauded ruths mother so that she did not come to her husband portionless all goes well with fred fenton he is still in the employ of john wainwright on a largely increased salary and is always a welcome guest at the home of the banker rose is as partial to him as ever and it would not be surprising if she should some day marry the exerie trainboy fred and his mother live in a handsome flat up town and albert his younger brother is making rapid progress as a designer it looks as if the clouds had passed away succeeded by the sunshine of permanent prosperity the end
