builder morning hope youll say yes he shakes hands and goes out followed by harris when the door is dosed builder stands a moment quite still with a gratified smile on his face then turns and scrutinises himself in the glass over the hearth while he is doing so the door from the diningroom is opened quietly and camille comes in builder suddenly seeing her reflected in the mirror turns builder what is it camille camille madame send me for a letter she say you have monsieur from the dyer and cleaner with a bill builder feeling in his pockets yes no its on the table camille goes to the writingtable and looks that blue thing camille taking it up non monsieur this is from the gas builder oh ah he moves up to the table and turns over papers camille stands motionless close by with

suspicion of encounter between their eyes camille goes out builder turning to his chair dont know about that woman shes a tantalizer he compresses his lips and is settling back into his chair when the door from the hall is opened and his daughter maud comes in a pretty girl rather pale with fine eyes though her face has a determined cast her manner at this moment is by no means decisive she has a letter in her hand and advances rather as if she were stalking her father who after a hallo maud has begun to read his paper maud getting as far as the table father builder not lowering the paper well i know that tone what do you want money maud i always want money of course but but builder pulling out a noteabstractedly heres five pounds for you maud advancing takes it then seems to find what she has come for more on her chest than ever builder unconscious will you take a letter for me maud sits down left of table and prepares to take down the letter dictating dear mr mayor referring to your call this morning i have er given the matter very careful consideration and though somewhat reluctant maud are you really reluctant father builder go on to assume greater responsibilities i feel it my duty to come forward in accordance with your wish the er honour is one of which i hardly feel myself worthy but you may rest assured maud worthy but you do you know builder look here are you trying to get a rise out of me because you wont succeed this morning maud i thought you were trying to get one out of me builder well how would you express it maud i know im the best man for the place and so do you builder the disrespect of you young people is something extraordinary and that reminds me where do you go every evening now after tea maud i i dont know builder come now that wont do youre never in the house from six to seven maud well it has to do with my education builder why you finished that two years ago maud well call it a hobby if you like then father she takes up the letter she brought in and seems on the point of broaching it builder hobby well what is it maud i dont want to irritate you father builder you cant irritate me more than by having secrets see what that led to in your sisters case and by the way im going to put an end to that this morning youll be glad to have her back wont you maud startled what builder your mother and i are going round to athene at twelve oclock i shall make it up with her she must come back here maud aghast but hiding it oh its its no good father she wont builder we shall see that ive quite got over my tantrum and i expect she has maud earnestly father i do really assure you she wont its only wasting your time and making you eat humble pie builder well i can eat a good deal this morning its all nonsense a familys a family maud more and more disturbed but hiding it father if i were you i wouldntreally its notdignified builder you can leave me to judge of that its not dignified for the mayor of this town to have an unmarried daughter as young as athene living by herself away from home this idea that shes on a visit wont wash any longer now finish that letter worthy but you may rest assured that i shall do my best to sustain the er dignity of the office maud types desperately got that and er preserve the tradition so worthily no so staunchly er er maud upheld builder ah upheld by yourself faithfully yours maud finishing father you thought athene went off in a huff it wasnt that a bit she always meant to go she just got you into a rage to make it easier she hated living at home builder nonsense why on earth should she maud well she did and so do checking herself and so you see itll only make you ridiculous to go builder rises now whats behind this maud maud behind oh nothing builder the fact is you girls have been spoiled and you enjoy twisting my tail but you cant make me roar this morning im too pleased with things youll see itll be all right with athene maud very suddenly father builder grimly humorous well get it off your chest whats that letter about maud failing again and crumpling the letter behind her back oh nothing builder everythings nothing this morning do you know what sort of people athene associates with now i suppose you see her maud sometimes builder well maud nobody much there isnt anybody here to associate with its all hopelessly behind the times builder oh you think so thats the inflammatory fiction you pick up i tell you what young woman the sooner you and your sister get rid of your silly notions about not living at home and making your own way the sooner youll both get married and make it men dont like the new spirit in women they may say they do but they dont maud you dont father i know builder well im very ordinary if you keep your eyes open youll soon see that maud men dont like freedom for anybody but themselves builder thats not the way to put it tapping out his pipe women in your class have never had to face realities maud no but we want to builder goodhumouredly well ill bet you what you like athenes dose of reality will have cured her maud and ill bet you no i wont builder youd better not athene will come home and only too glad to do it ring for topping and order the car at twelve as he opens the door to pass out maud starts forward but checks herself maud looking at her watch halfpast eleven good heavens she goes to the bell and

puts on the table and disappears into the kitchen she reappears with a bread pan which she deposits in the centre of the room then crosses again to the bedroom and once more reappears with a clothes

lose ones temper builder thats very nice and placid sort of thing you women who live sheltered lives can say i often wonder if you women realise the strain on a business man mrs builder in her softly ironical voice it seems a shame to add the strain of family life builder youve always been so passive when i want a thing ive got to have it mrs builder ive noticed that builder with a short laugh odd if you hadnt in twentythree years touching a canvas standing against the chair with his toe art just a pretext we shall be having maud wanting to cut loose next shes very restive still i oughtnt to

the box strong very and not good he opens the door kitchen he shuts it crosses and opens the door right bedroom mrs builder to his disappearing form do you think you ought john he has disappeared and she ends with an expressive movement of her hands a long sigh and a closing of her eyes builders peremptory voice is heard julia what now she follows into the bedroom the maid annie puts her head out of the kitchen door she comes out a step as if to fly then at builders voice shrinks back into the kitchen builder reappearing with a razor strop in one hand and a shavingbrush in the other is followed by mrs builder builder explain these my god wheres that girl mrs builder john dont getting between him and the kitchen door its not dignified builder i dont care a damn mrs builder john you

hand why the deuce doesnt she come mrs builder suppose you leave me here to see her builder ominously this is my job mrs builder i think its more mine builder dont stand there opposing everything i

is mrs builder has approached him and they have both turned towards the opening door guy herringhame comes in they are a little out of his line of sight and he has shut the door before he sees them when he does his mouth falls open and his hand on to the knob of the door he is a comely young man in harris tweeds moreover he is smoking he would speak if he could but his surprise is too excessive

lifts his hands ive a good mind to shake it out of you athene shall i call guy he drops his hands confess that being a good husband and father has tried you terribly it has us you know builder taking refuge in sarcasm when youve quite done being funny perhaps youll tell me why youve behaved like a common street flapper athene simply i couldnt bear to think of guy as a family man thats all absolutely its not his fault hes been awfully anxious to be one builder youve disgraced us then thats what it comes to athene i dont want to be unkind but youve brought it on yourself builder genuinely distracted i cant even get a glimmer of what you mean ive never been anything but firm impatient perhaps im not an angel no ordinary healthy man is ive never grudged you girls any comfort or pleasure athene except wills of our own builder what do you want with wills of your own till youre married athene you forget mother builder what about her athene shes very married has she a will of her own builder sullenly shes learnt to know when im in the right athene i dont ever mean to learn to know when guys in the right mothers fortyone and twentythree years of that shes been your wife its a long time father dont you ever look at her face builder troubled in a remote way rubbish athene i didnt want my face to get like that builder with such views about marriage what business had you to

me shes got a will of her own too i can tell you builder now look here athene its always been my way to face accomplished facts whats done cant be undone but it can be remedied you must marry this youngat once before it gets out hes behaved like a ruffian but by your own confession youve behaved worse youve been bitten by this modern disease this this utter lack of common decency theres an eternal order in certain things and marriage is one of them in fact its the chief come now give me a promise and ill try my utmost to forget the whole thing athene when we quarrelled father you said you didnt care what became of me builder i was angry athene so you are now builder come athene dont be childish promise me athene with a little shudder no we were on the edge of it but now ive seen

ill sit down under this injustice your mother is is pretty irritating i can tell you she she everything suppressed and and no blood in her athene i knew it builder aware that he has confirmed some thought in her that he had no intention of confirming whats that athene dont you ever look at your own face father when you shave for instance builder of course i do athene it isnt satisfied is it builder i dont know what on earth you mean athene you cant help it but youd be ever so much happier if you were a mohammedan and two or three instead of one had had learned to know when you were in the right builder pon my soul this is outrageous athene truth often is builder will you be quiet athene i dont ever want to feel sorry for guy in that way builder i think youre the most immodest im

every turn be quiet you athene has mother never turned builder youre an unnatural girl go your own way to hell athene i am not coming back home father builder wrenching open the door right julia come

the outer door followed by his wife to athene ive done with you he goes out mrs builder who has so far seemed to accompany him shuts the door quickly and remains in the studio she stands there with

the mayor clears his throat chantreys eyes goggle harris bends over and writes rapidly during the struggle your worship a young man has appeared on the scene and at the instigation of the young woman the same who was assaulted assists me in securing the prisoner whose language and resistance was violent in the extreme we placed him in a cab which we found outside and i conveyed him to the station chantrey what was his er conduct in the er cab moon he sat quiet chantrey that seems moon seein i had his further arm twisted behind him mayor looking at builder any questions to ask him builder makes

what do you say to that constable moon stepping the mechanical two paces i dont deny there was a struggle your worship but its my impression i was it chantrey of course you were bit we can see that but with the cane or with the fist moon a little flurried i i with the fist sir mayor be careful will you swear to that moon with that sudden uncertainty which comes over the most honest in such circumstances not not so to speak in black and white your worship but that was my idea at the time mayor you wont swear to it moon ill swear he called me an idiot and a lout the words made a deep impression on me chantrey to himself mort aux vaches mayor eh thatll do constable stand back now who else saw the struggle mrs builder youre not obliged to say anything unless you like thats your privilege as his wife while he is speaking the door has been opened and harris has gone swiftly to it spoken to someone and returned he leans forward to the mayor eh wait a minute mrs builder do you wish to give evidence mrs builder rising no mr mayor mrs builder sits mayor very good to harris now then what is it harris says something in a low and concerned voice the mayors face lengthens he leans to his right and consults chantrey who gives a faint and deprecating shrug a moments silence mayor this is an open court the press have the right to attend if they wish harris goes to the door and admits a young man in glasses of a pleasant appearance and indicates to him a chair at the back at this untimely happening builders eyes have moved from side to side but now he regains his intent and bulllike stare at his fellow justices mayor to maud you can sit down miss builder maud resumes her seat miss athene builder you were present i think athene rising yes sir mayor what do you say to this matter athene i didnt see anything very clearly but i think my sisters account is correct sir mayor is it your impression that the cane inflicted the injury athene in a low voice yes mayor with or without deliberate intent athene oh without builder looks at her mayor but you were not in a position to see very well athene no sir mayor your sister having withdrawn her charge we neednt go into that very good he motions her to sit down athene turning her eyes on her fathers impassive figure sits mayor now there was a young man pointing to herringhame is this the young man moon yes your worship mayor whats your name guy guy herringhame mayor address guy er the aerodrome sir mayor private i mean the moment is one of considerable tension guy with an effort at the moment sir i havent one ive just left my diggings and havent yet got any others mayor hm the aerodrome how did you come to be present guy i er builders eyes go round and rest on him for a moment its in my sisters studio that miss athene builder is at present working sir i just happened to to turn up mayor did you appear on the scene as the constable says during the struggle guy yes sir mayor did he summon you to his aid guy yes no sir miss maud builder did that mayor what do you say to this blow guy jerking his chin up a little oh i saw that clearly mayor well let us hear guy the constables arm struck the cane violently and it flew up and landed him in the eye mayor with a little grunt you are sure of that guy quite sure sir mayor did you hear any language guy nothing out of the ordinary sir one or two damns and blasts mayor you call that ordinary guy well hes a magistrate sir the mayor utters a profound grunt chantrey smiles there is a silence then the mayor leans over to chantrey for a short colloquy chantrey did you witness any particular violence other than a resistance to arrest guy no sir mayor with a gesture of dismissal very well that seems to be the evidence defendant john builder what do you say to all this builder in a voice different from any we have heard from him say what business had he to touch me a magistrate i gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house for interfering with me for taking my wife home mayor that charge is not pressed and we cant go into the circumstances what do you wish to say about your conduct towards the constable builder in his throat not a damned thing mayor embarrassed i i didnt catch chantrey nothing nothing he said mr mayor mayor clearing his throat i understand then that you do not wish to offer any explanation builder i consider myself abominably treated and i refuse to say another word mayor drily very good miss maud builder maud stands up mayor when you spoke of the defendant seeing red what exactly did you mean maud i mean that my father was so angry that he didnt know what he was doing chantrey would you say as angry as he er is now maud with a faint smile oh much more angry ralph builder stands up ralph would you allow me to say a word mr mayor mayor speaking of your own knowledge mr builder ralph in regard to the state of my brothers mind yes mr mayor he was undoubtedly under great strain yesterday certain circumstances domestic and otherwise mayor you mean that he might have been as one might say beside himself ralph exactly sir mayor had you seen your brother ralph i had seen him shortly before this unhappy business the mayor nods and makes a gesture so that maud and ralph sit down then leaning over he confers in a low voice with chantrey the rest all sit or stand exactly as if each was the only person in the room except the journalist who is writing busily and rather obviously making a sketch of builder mayor miss athene builder athene stands up this young man mr herringhame i take it is a friend of the familys a moment of some tension athene n no mr mayor not of my father or mother chantrey an acquaintance of yours athene yes mayor very good he clears his throat as the defendant wrongly we think refuses to offer his explanation of this matter the bench has to decide on the evidence as given there seems to be some discrepancy as to the blow which the constable undoubtedly received in view of this we incline to take the testimony of mr harris prompts him mr erringhame as the party least implicated personally in the affair and most likely to ave a cool and impartial view that evidence is to the effect that the blow was accidental there is no doubt however that the defendant used reprehensible language and offered some resistance to the constable in the execution of his duty evidence as been offered that he was in an excited state of mind and it is possible i dont say that this is any palliation but it is possible that he may have thought his position as magistrate made him er chantrey prompting caesars wife mayor eh we think considering all the circumstances and the fact that he has spent a night in a cell that justice will be met by er discharging him with a caution builder with a deeply muttered the devil you do walks out of the room the journalist grabbing his pad starts up and follows the builders rise and huddle and with herringhame are ushered out by harris mayor pulling out a large handkerchief and wiping his forehead my aunt chantrey these new constables mayor i say builderll have to go damn the press how they nose everything out the great unpaid we shall get it again he suddenly goes off into a fit of laughter come off it i says to the best of my recollection oh oh i shant hit a bird all day that poor devil builder its no joke for him you did it well mayor you did it well british justice is safe in your hands he blacked the fellows eye all right which i herewith produce oh my golly it beats the band his uncontrollable laughter and the mayors rueful appreciation are exchanged with lightning rapidity for a preternatural solemnity as the door opens admitting sergeant martin and the lugubrious object of their next attentions mayor charges sergeant steps forward to read the charge as the curtain falls scene ii noon the same day builders study topping is standing by the open window looking up and down

steady john builder go maud proudly all right we thought you might like to know that athenes married and that ive given up the movies now well go builder turns his back on them and sitting down at his writing table writes after a moments whispered conversation with their uncle the two girls go out ralph builder stands gazing with whimsical commiseration at his brothers back as builder finishes writing he goes up and puts his hand on his brothers shoulder ralph this is an awful jar old man builder heres what ive said to that fellow mr mayor you had the effrontery today to discharge me with a caution forsooth your fellow magistrate ive consulted my solicitor as to whether an action will lie for false imprisonment im informed that it wont i take this opportunity of saying that justice in this town is a travesty i have no wish to be associated further with you or your fellows but you are vastly mistaken if you imagine that i shall resign my position on the bench or the town council yours john builder ralph i say keep your sense of humour old boy builder grimly humour ive spent a night in a cell see this he holds out the document it disinherits my family ralph john builder ive done with those two ladies as to my wife if she doesnt come back when i suffer i make others suffer ralph julias very upset my dear fellow we all are the girls came here to try and builder rising they

whats that ralph lets boss our own natures before we boss those of other people have a sleep on it john before you do anything builder sleep i hadnt a wink last night if youd passed the night i had ralph i hadnt many myself topping enters builder take this note to the mayor with my compliments and dont bring back an answer topping very good sir theres a gentleman from the comet in the hall sir would you see him for a minute he says builder tell him to go to a voice says mr builder builder turns to see the figure of the journalist in the hall doorway topping goes out journalist advancing with his card mr builder its very good of you to see me i had the pleasure this morning i mean i tried to reach you when you left the mayors i thought you would probably have your own side of this unfortunate matter we shall be glad to give it every prominence topping has withdrawn and ralph builder at the window stands listening builder drily regarding the journalist who has spoken in a pleasant and polite voice very good of you journalist not at all sir we felt that you would almost certainly have good reasons of your own which would put the matter in quite a different light builder good reasons i should think so i tell you a very little more of this liberty licence i call it and there isnt a man wholl be able to call himself head of a family journalist encouragingly quite builder if the law thinks it can back up revolt its damned well mistaken i struck my daughter i was in a passion as you would have been journalist encouraging im sure builder glaring at him well i dont know that you would you look a soft sort but any man with any blood in him journalist can one ask what she was doing sir we couldnt get that point quite clear builder doing i just had my arm round my wife trying to induce her to come home with me after a little family tiff and this girl came at me i lost my temper and tapped her with my cane and that policeman brought by my own daughter a policeman if the law is going to enter private houses and abrogate domestic authority where the hell shall we be journalist encouraging no im sure im sure builder the maudlin sentimentality in these days is absolutely rotting this country a man cant be master in his own house cant require his wife to fulfil her duties cant attempt to control the conduct of his daughters without coming up against it and incurring odium a man cant control his employees he cant put his foot down on rebellion anywhere without a lot of humanitarians and licencelovers howling at him journalist excellent sir excellent builder excellent its damnable here am i a man whos always tried to do his duty in private life and public brought up before the bench my god because i was doing that duty with a little too much zeal perhaps im not an angel journalist no no of course builder a proper englishman never is but there are no proper englishmen nowadays he crosses the room in his fervour ralph suddenly as i look at faces builder absorbed what i told this young man i wasnt an angel journalist drawing him on yes sir i quite understand builder if the law thinks it can force me to be one of your weakkneed sentimentalists who let everybody do what they like ralph there are a good many who stand on their rights left john builder absorbed what how can men stand on their rights left journalist im afraid you had a painful experience sir builder every kind of humiliation i spent the night in a stinking cell i havent eaten since breakfast yesterday did they think i was going to eat the muck they shoved in and all because in a moment of anger which i regret i regret i happened to strike my daughter who was interfering between me and my wife the thing would be funny if it werent so disgusting a mans house used to be sanctuary what is it now with all the world poking their noses in he stands before the fire with his head bent excluding as it were his interviewer and all the world journalist preparing to go thank you very much mr builder im sure i can do you justice would you like to see a proof builder half conscious of him what journalist or will you trust me builder i wouldnt trust you a yard journalist at the door very well sir you shall have a proof i promise good afternoon and thank you builder here but he is gone and builder is left staring at his brother on whose face is still that look of whimsical commiseration ralph take a pull old man have a hot bath and go to bed builder theyve chosen to drive me to extremes now let them take the consequences i dont care a kick what anybody thinks ralph sadly well i wont worry you anymore now builder with a nasty laugh no come again tomorrow ralph when youve had a sleep for the sake of the family name john dont be hasty builder shut the stable door no my boy the horse has gone ralph well well with a lingering look at his brother who has sat down sullenly at the writing table he goes out into the hall builder remains staring in front of him the diningroom door opens and camilles head is thrust in seeing him she draws back but he catches sight of her builder here camille comes doubtfully up to the writing table her forehead is puckered as if she were thinking hard builder looking at her unsmiling so you want to be my mistress do you camille makes a nervous gesture well you shall come here camille not moving you f frighten me builder ive paid a pretty price for you but youll make up for it you and others camille starting back no i dont like you today no builder come along she is just within reach and he seizes her arm all my married life ive put a curb on myself for the sake of respectability ive been a man of principle my girl as you saw yesterday well they dont want that he draws her close you can sit on my knee now camille shrinking no i dont want to today builder but you shall theyve asked for it camille with a supple movement slipping away from him they what is all that i dont want any trouble no no i am not taking any she moves back towards the door builder utters a sardonic laugh oh you are a dangerous man no no not for me goodbye sare she turns swiftly and goes out builder again utters his glum laugh and then as he sits alone staring before him perfect silence reigns in the room over the windowsill behind him a boys face is seen to rise it hangs there a moment with a grin spreading on it boys voice sotto johnny builder as builder turns sharply it vanishes oo beat is wife builder rushes to the window boys voice more distant and a little tentative johnny builder builder you little devil if i catch you ill wring your blasted little neck boys voice a little distant oo blacked the coppers eye builder in an ungovernable passion seizes a small flowerpot from the sill and dings it with all his force the sound of a crash boys voice very distant yaaah missed builder stands leaning out face injected with blood shaking his fist the curtain falls for a few seconds scene iii evening the same day builders study is dim and neglectedlooking the window is still open though it has become night a street lamp outside shines in and the end of its rays fall on builder asleep he is sitting in a high chair at the fireside end of the writingtable with his elbows on it and his cheek resting on his hand he is still unshaven and his clothes unchanged a boys head appears above the level of the windowsill as if beheaded and fastened there boys voice in a forceful whisper johnny builder builder stirs uneasily the boys head vanishes builder raising his other hand makes a sweep before his face as if to brush away a mosquito he wakes takes in remembrance and sits a moment staring gloomily before him the door from the hall is opened and topping comes in with a long envelope in his hand topping approaching from the comet sir proof of your interview sir will you please revise the messenger says he wants to take it back at once builder taking it all right ill ring topping shall i close in sir builder not now topping withdraws builder turns up a standard lamp on the table opens the envelope and begins reading the galley slip the signs of uneasiness and discomfort grow on him builder did i say that muck muck he drops the proof sits a moment moving his head and rubbing one hand uneasily on the surface of the table then reaches out for the telephone receiver town pause the comet john builder give me the editor pause that you mr editor john builder speaking that interview ive got the proof it wont do scrap the whole thing please i dont want to say anything pause yes i know i said it all i cant help that pause no ive changed my mind scrap it please pause no i will not say anything pause you can say what you dam well please pause i mean it if you put a word into my mouth ill sue you for defamation of character its undignified muck im tearing it up goodnight he replaces the receiver and touches a bell then taking up the galley slip he tears it viciously across into many pieces and rams them into the envelope topping enters here give this to the messengersharp and tell him to run with it topping whose hand can feel the condition of the contents with a certain surprise yes sir he goes with a look back from the door the mayor is here sir i dont know whether you would wish builder rising takes a turn up and down the room builder nor do i yes ill see him topping goes out and builder stands over by the fender with his head a little down topping reentering the mayor sir he retires up left the mayor is overcoated and carries of all things a top hat he reaches the centre of the room before he speaks mayor embarrassed well builder builder well mayor come that caution of mine was quite parliamentary i ad to save face you know builder and what about my face mayor well you you made it difficult for me ang it all put yourself into my place builder grimly id rather put you into mine as it was last night mayor yes yes i know but the bench has got a name to keep up must stand well in the peoples eyes as it is i sailed very near the wind suppose we had an ordinary person up before us for striking a woman builder i didnt strike a woman i struck my daughter mayor well but shes not a child you know and you did resist the police if no worse come youd have been the first to maintain british justice shake ands builder is that what you came for mayor taken aback why yes nobody can be more sorry than i builder eyewash you came to beg me to resign mayor well its precious awkward builder we all feel builder save your powder mayor ive slept on it since i wrote you that note take my resignations mayor in relieved embarrassment thats right we must face your position builder with a touch of grim humour i never yet met a man who couldnt face another mans position mayor after all what is it builder splendid isolation no wife no daughters no councillorship no magistracy no future with a laugh not even a french maid and why because i tried to exercise a little wholesome family authority thats the position youre facing mayor mayor dear dear youre devilish bitter builder its unfortunate this publicity but itll all blow over and youll be back where you were youve a good sound practical sense underneath your temper a pause come now a pause well ill say goodnight then builder you shall have them in writing tomorrow mayor with sincerity come shake ands builder after a long look holds out his hand the two men exchange a grip the mayor turning abruptly goes out builder remains motionless for a minute then resumes his seat at the side of the writing table leaning his head on his hands the boys head is again seen rising above the level of the window sill and another and another follows till the three as if decapitated heads are seen in a row boys voices one after another in a whispered crescendo johnny builder johnny builder johnny builder builder rises turns and stares at them the three heads disappear and a boys voice cries shrilly johnny builder builder moves towards the window voices are now crying in various pitches and keys johnny builder beatey builder beat is wifeer beatey builder builder stands quite motionless staring with the street lamp lighting up a queer rather pitiful defiance on his face the voices swell there comes a sudden swish and splash of water and broken yells of dismay toppings voice scat you young devils the sound of scuffling feet and a longdrawnout and distant miaou builder stirs shuts the window draws the curtains goes to the armchair before the fireplace and sits down in it topping enters with a little tray on which is a steaming jug of fluid some biscuits and a glass he comes stealthily up level with the chair builder stirs and looks up at him topping excuse me sir you must ave digested yesterday mornings breakfast by now must live to eat sir builder all right put it down topping putting the tray down on the table and taking up builders pipe i fair copped those young devils builder youre a good fellow topping filling the pipe youll excuse me sir the missis has come back sir builder stares at him and topping stops he hands builder the filled pipe and a box of matches builder with a shiver light the fire topping im chilly while topping lights the fire builder puts the pipe in his mouth and applies a match to it topping having lighted the fire turns to go gets as far as half way then comes back level with the table and regards the silent brooding figure in the chair builder suddenly give me that paper on the table no the other one the will topping takes up the will and gives it to him topping with much hesitation excuse me sir its pluck that gets em ome sir begging your pardon builder has resumed his attitude and does not answer in a voice just touched with feeling goodnight sir builder without turning his head goodnight topping has gone builder sits drawing at his pipe between the firelight and the light from the standard lamp he takes the pipe out of his mouth and a quiver passes over his face with a half angry gesture he rubs the back of his hand across his eyes builder to himself pluck pluck his lips quiver again he presses them hard together puts his pipe back into his mouth and taking the will thrusts it into the newlylighted fire and holds it there with a poker while he is doing this the door from the hall is opened quietly and mrs builder enters without his hearing her she has a work bag in her hand she moves slowly to the table and stands looking at him then going up to the curtains she mechanically adjusts them and still keeping her eyes on builder comes down to the table and pours out his usual glass of whisky toddy builder who has become conscious of her presence turns in his chair as she hands it to him he sits a moment motionless then takes it from her and squeezes her hand mrs builder goes silently to her usual chair below the fire and taking out some knitting begins to knit builder makes an effort to speak does not succeed and sits drawing at his pipe the curtain falls etext editors bookmarks comes of not knowin when to stop bein firm i knew how it would be when we

how much de levis nearly a thousandnine hundred and seventy i think winsor phew again the faint tone of outrage that a man should have so much money about him de levis i sold my rosemary filly today on the course to bentman the bookie and he paid me in notes winsor what that weed dancy gave you in the spring de levis yes but i tried her pretty high the other day and shes in the cambridgeshire i was only out of my room a quarter of an hour and i locked my door winsor again outraged you locked de levis not seeing the fine shade yes and had the key here he taps his pocket look here he holds out a pocketbook its been stuffed with my shaving papers winsor between feeling that such things dont happen and a sense that he will have to clear it up this is damned awkward de levis de levis with steel in his voice yes i should like it back winsor have you got the numbers of the notes de levis no winsor what were they de levis one hundred three fifties and the rest tens and fives winsor what dyou want me to do de levis unless theres anybody you think winsor eyeing him is it likely de levis then i think the police ought to see my room its a lot of money winsor good lord were not in town therell be nobody nearer than newmarket at this time of night four miles the door from the bedroom is suddenly opened and lady adela appears she has on a lace cap over her finished hair and the wrapper lady a closing the door what is it are you ill mr de levis winsor worse hes had a lot of money stolen nearly a thousand pounds lady a gracious where de levis from under my pillow lady adela my

into her room and closes the door winsor look here de levis this isnt an hotel its the sort of thing that doesnt happen in a decent house are you sure youre not mistaken and didnt have them stolen on the course de levis absolutely i counted them just before putting them under my pillow then i locked the door and had the key here theres only one door you know winsor how was your window de levis open winsor drawing back the curtains of his own window youve got a balcony like this any sign of a ladder or anything de levis no winsor it must have been done from the window unless someone had a skeleton key who knew youd got that money where did kentman pay you de levis just round the corner in the further paddock winsor anybody about de levis oh yes winsor suspicious de levis i didnt notice anything winsor you must have been marked down and followed here de levis how would they know my room winsor might have got it somehow a knock from the corridor come in treisure the butler appears a silent grave man of almost supernatural conformity de levis gives him a quick hard look noted and resented by winsor treisure to winsor yes sir winsor who valets mr de levis treisure robert sir winsor when was he up last treisure in the ordinary course of things about ten oclock sir winsor when did he go to bed treisure i dismissed at eleven winsor but did he go treisure to the best of my knowledge is there anything i can do sir winsor disregarding a sign from de levis look here treisure mr de levis has had a large sum of money taken from his bedroom within the last half hour treisure indeed sir winsor roberts quite all right isnt he treisure he is sir de levis how do you know treisures eyes rest on de levis treisure i am a pretty good judge of character sir if youll excuse me winsor look here de levis eighty or ninety notes must have been pretty bulky you didnt have them on you at dinner de levis no winsor where did you put them de levis in a boot and the boot in my suitcase and locked it treisure smiles faintly winsor again slightly outraged by such precautions in his house and you found it locked and took them from there to put under your pillow de levis yes winsor run your mind over things treisure has any stranger been about treisure no sir winsor this seems to have happened between and is that right de levis nods any noiseanything outsideanything suspicious anywhere treisure running his mind very still no sir winsor what time did you shut up treisure i should say about elevenfifteen sir as soon as major colford and captain dancy had finished billiards what was mr de levis doing out of his room if i may ask sir winsor having a bath with his room locked and the key in his pocket treisure thank you sir de levis conscious of indefinable suspicion damn it what do you mean i was treisure i beg your pardon sir winsor concealing a smile look here treisure its infernally awkward for everybody treisure it is sir winsor what do you suggest treisure the proper thing sir i suppose would be a cordon and a complete search in our interests winsor i entirely refuse to suspect anybody treisure but if mr de levis feels otherwise sir de levis stammering i all i know is the money was there and its gone winsor compunctious quite its pretty sickening for you but so it is for anybody else however we must do our best to get it back for you a knock on the door winsor hallo treisure opens the door and general canynge enters oh its you general come in adelas told you general canynge nods he is a slim man of about sixty very well preserved intensely neat and selfcontained and still in evening dress his eyelids droop slightly but his eyes are keen and his expression astute winsor well general whats the first move canynge lifting his eyebrows mr de levis presses the matter de levis flicked again unless you think its too plebeian of me general canynge a thousand pounds canynge drily just so then we must wait for the police winsor lady adela has got through to them what height are these rooms from the ground treisure treisure twentythree feet from the terrace sir canynge any ladders near treisure one in the stables sir very heavy no others within three hundred yards canynge just slip down and see whether thats been moved treisure very good general he goes out de levis uneasily of course he i suppose you winsor we do canynge you had better leave this in our hands de levis de levis certainly only the way he winsor curtly treisure has been here since he was a boy i should as soon suspect myself de levis looking from one to the other with sudden anger you seem to think what was i to do take it lying down and let whoever it is get clear off i suppose its natural to want my money back canynge looks at his nails winsor out of the window winsor turning of course de levis de levis sullenly well ill go to my room when the police come perhaps youll let me know he goes out winsor phew did you ever see such a dressinggown the door is opened lady adela and margaret orme come in the latter is a vivid young lady of about twentyfive in a vivid wrapper she is smoking a cigarette lady a ive told the dancys she was in bed and i got through to newmarket charles and inspector dede is coming like the wind on a motor cycle margaret did he say like the wind adela he must have imagination isnt this gorgeous poor little ferdy winsor vexed you might take it seriously margaret its pretty beastly for us all what time did you come up margaret i came up with adela am i suspected charles how thrilling winsor did you hear anything margaret only little ferdy splashing winsor and saw nothing margaret not even that alas lady a with a finger held up leste un peu leste oh here are the dancys come in you two mabel and ronald dancy enter she is a pretty young woman with bobbed hair fortunately for she has just got out of bed and is in her nightgown and a wrapper dancy is in his smoking jacket he has a pale determined face with high cheekbones small deepset dark eyes reddish crisp hair and looks like a horseman winsor awfully sorry to disturb you mrs dancy but i suppose you and ronny havent heard anything de leviss room is just beyond ronnys dressingroom you know mabel ive been asleep nearly half an hour and ronnys only just come up canynge did you happen to look out of your window mrs dancy mabel yes i stood there quite five minutes canynge when mabel just about eleven i should think it was raining hard then canynge yes its just stopped you saw nothing mabel no dancy what time does he say the money was taken winsor between the quarter and half past hed locked his door and had the key with him margaret how quaint just like an hotel does he put his boots out lady a dont be so naughty meg canynge when exactly did you come up dance dancy about ten minutes ago id only just got into my dressingroom before lady adela came ive been writing letters in the hall since colford and i finished billiards canynge you werent up for anything in between dancy no margaret the mystery of the grey room dancy oughtnt the grounds to be searched for footmarks canynge thats for the police dancy the deuce are they coming canynge directly a knock yes treisure enters well treisure the ladder has not been moved general there isnt a sign winsor all right get robert up but dont say anything to him by the way were expecting the police treisure i trust they will not find a mares nest sir if i may say so he goes winsor de levis has got wrong with treisure suddenly but i say what would any of us have done if wed been in his shoes margaret a thousand pounds i cant even conceive having it dancy we probably shouldnt have found it out lady a no but if we had dancy come to you as he did winsor yes but theres a way of doing things canynge we shouldnt have wanted the police margaret no thats it the hotel touch lady a poor young man i think were rather hard on him winsor he sold that weed you gave him dancy to kentman the bookie and these were the proceeds dancy oh winsor hed tried her high he said dancy grimly he would mabel oh ronny what bad luck winsor he must have been followed here at the window after rain like that there ought to be footmarks the splutter of a motor cycle is heard margaret heres the wind winsor whats the move now general canynge you and i had better see the inspector in de leviss room winsor to the others if youll all be handy in case he wants to put questions for himself margaret i hope hell want me its just too thrilling dancy i hope he wont want me im dogtired come on mabel he puts his arm in his wifes canynge just a minute charles he draws dose to winsor as the others are departing to their rooms winsor yes general canynge we must be careful with this inspector fellow if he pitches hastily on somebody in the house itll be very disagreeable winsor by jove it will canynge we dont want to rouse any ridiculous suspicion winsor quite a knock come in treisure enters treisure inspector dede sir winsor show him in treisure robert is in readiness sir but i could swear he knows nothing about it winsor all right treisure reopens the door and says come in please the inspector enters blue formal moustachioed with a peaked cap in his hand winsor good evening inspector sorry to have brought you out at this time of night inspector good evenin sir mr winsor youre the owner here i think winsor yes general canynge inspector good evenin general i understand a large sum of money winsor yes shall we go straight to the room it was taken from one of my guests mr de levis its the third room on the left canynge weve not been in there yet inspector in fact weve done nothing except to find out that the stable ladder has not been moved we havent even searched the grounds inspector right sir ive brought a man with me they go out curtain and interval of a minute scene ii the same set is used for this scene with the different arrangement of furniture as specified the bedroom of de levis is the same in shape as winsors dressing room except that there is only one door to the corridor the furniture however is differently arranged a small fourposter bedstead stands against the wall right back jutting into the room a chair on which de leviss clothes are thrown stands at its foot there is a dressingtable against the wall to the left of the open windows where the curtains are drawn back and a stone balcony is seen against the wall to the right of the window is a chest of drawers and a washstand is against the wall left on a small table to the right of the bed an electric reading lamp is turned up and there is a light over the dressingtable the inspector is standing plumb centre looking at the bed and de levis by the back of the chair at the foot of the bed winsor and canynge are close to the door right forward inspector finishing a note now sir if this is the room as you left it for your bath just show us exactly what you did after takin the pocketbook from the suit case where was that by the way de levis pointing where it is now under the dressingtable he comes forward to the front of the chair opens the pocketbook goes through the pretence of counting his shaving papers closes the pocketbook takes it to the head of the bed and slips it under the pillow makes the motion of taking up his pyjamas crosses below the inspector to the washstand takes up a bath sponge crosses to the door takes out the key opens the door inspector writing we now have the room as it was when the theft was committed reconstruct accordin to uman nature gentlemen assumin the thief to be in the room what would he try first the clothes the dressintable the suit case the chest of drawers and last the bed he moves accordingly examining the glass on the dressingtable the surface of the suit cases and the handles of the drawers with a spyglass for fingermarks canynge sotto voce to winsor the order would have been just the other way the inspector goes on hands and knees and examines the carpet between the window and the bed de levis can i come in again inspector standing up did you open the window sir or was it open when you first came in de levis i opened it inspector drawin the curtains back first de levis yes inspector sharply are you sure there was nobody in the room already de levis taken aback i dont know i never thought i didnt look under the bed if you mean that inspector jotting did not look under bed did you look under it after the theft de levis no i didnt inspector ah now what did you do after you came back from your bath just give us that precisely de levis locked the door and left the key in put back my sponge and took off my dressinggown and put it there he points to the footrails of the bed then i drew the curtains again inspector shutting the window de levis no i got into bed felt for my watch to see the time my hand struck the pocketbook and somehow it felt thinner i took it out looked into it and found the notes gone and these shaving papers instead inspector let me have a look at those sir he applies the spy glasses and then de levis i think i just sat on the bed inspector thinkin and cursin a bit i suppose yees de levis then i put on my dressinggown and went straight to mr winsor inspector not lockin the door de levis no inspector exactly with a certain finality now sir what time did you come up de levis about eleven inspector precise if you can give it me de levis well i know it was elevenfifteen when i put my watch under my pillow before i went to the bath and i suppose id been about a quarter of an hour undressing i should say after eleven if anything inspector just undressin didnt look over your bettin book de levis no inspector no prayers or anything de levis no inspector pretty slippy with your undressin as a rule de levis yes say five past eleven inspector mr winsor what time did the gentleman come to you winsor halfpast eleven inspector how do you fix that sir winsor id just looked at the time and told my wife to send her maid off inspector then weve got it fixed between and jots now sir before we go further id like to see your butler and the footman that valets this gentleman winsor with distaste very well inspector only my butler has been with us from a boy inspector quite so this is just clearing the ground sir winsor general dyou mind touching that bell canynge rings a bell by the bed inspector well gentlemen there are four possibilities either the thief was here all the time waiting under the bed and slipped out after this gentleman had gone to mr winsor or he came in with a key that fits the lock and ill want to see all the keys in the house or he came in with a skeleton key and out by the window probably droppin from the balcony or he came in by the window with a rope or ladder and out the same way pointing theres a footmark here from a big boot which has been out of doors since it rained canynge inspector you er walked up to the window when you first came into the room inspector stiffly i had not overlooked that general canynge of course a knock on the door relieves a certain tension winsor come in the footman robert a freshfaced young man enters followed by treisure inspector you valet mr mr de levis i think robert yes sir inspector at what time did you take his clothes and boots robert ten oclock sir inspector with a pounce did you happen to look under his bed robert no sir inspector did you come up again to bring the clothes back robert no sir theyre still downstairs inspector did you come up again for anything robert no sir inspector what time did you go to bed robert just after eleven sir inspector scrutinising him now be careful did you go to bed at all robert no sir inspector then why did you say you did theres been a theft here and anything you say may be used against you robert yes sir i meant i went to my room inspector where is your room robert on the ground floor at the other end of the right wing sir winsor its the extreme end of the house from this inspector hes with the other two footmen inspector were you there alone robert no sir thomas and frederick was there too treisure thats right ive seen them inspector holding up his hand for silence were you out of the room again after you went in robert no sir inspector what were you doing if you didnt go to bed robert to winsor beggin your pardon sir we were playin bridge inspector very good you can go ill see them later on robert yes sir theyll say the same as me he goes out leaving a smile on the face of all except the inspector and de levis inspector sharply call him back treisure calls robert and the footman reenters robert yes sir inspector did you notice anything particular about mr de leviss clothes robert only that they were very good sir inspector i mean anything peculiar robert after reflection yes sir inspector well robert a pair of his boots this evenin was reduced to one sir inspector what did you make of that robert i thought he might have thrown the other at a cat or something inspector did you look for it robert no sir i meant to draw his attention to it in the morning inspector very good robert yes sir he goes again inspector looking at de levis well sir theres your story corroborated de levis stifly i dont know why it should need corroboration inspector inspector in my experience you can never have too much of that to winsor i understand theres a lady in the room on this side pointing left and a gentleman on this pointing right were they in their rooms winsor miss orme was captain dancy not inspector do they know of the affair winsor yes inspector well id just like the keys of their doors for a minute my man will get them he goes to the door opens it and speaks to a constable in the corridor to treisure you can go with him treisure goes out in the meantime ill just examine the balcony he goes out on the balcony followed by de levis winsor to canynge damn de levis and his money its deuced invidious all this general canynge the inspectors no earthly there is a simultaneous reentry of the inspector from the balcony and of treisure and the constable from the corridor constable handing key room on the left sir handing key room on the right sir the inspector tries the keys in the door watched with tension by the others the keys fail inspector put them back hands keys to constable who goes out followed by treisure ill have to try every key in the house sir winsor inspector do you really think it necessary to disturb the whole house and knock up all my guests its most disagreeable all this you know the loss of the money is not such a great matter mr de levis has a very large income canynge you could get the numbers of the notes from kentman the bookmaker inspector hell probably have the big ones anyway inspector shaking his head a bookie i dont suppose he will sir its come and go with them all the time winsor we dont want a meldon court scandal inspector inspector well mr winsor ive formed my theory as he speaks de levis comes in from the balcony and i dont say to try the keys is necessary to it but strictly i ought to exhaust the possibilities winsor what do you say de levis dyou want everybody in the house knocked up so that their keys can be tried de levis whose face since his return expresses a curious excitement no i dont inspector very well gentlemen in my opinion the thief walked in before the door was locked probably during dinner and was under the bed he escaped by dropping from the balcony the creeper at that corner he points stage left has been violently wrenched ill go down now and examine the grounds and ill see you again sir he makes another entry in his notebook goodnight then gentlemen canynge goodnight winsor with relief ill come with you inspector he escorts him to the door and they go out de levis suddenly general i know who took them canynge the deuce you do are you following the inspectors theory de levis contemptuously that ass pulling the shaving papers out of the case no the man who put those there was clever and cool enough to wrench that creeper off the balcony as a blind come and look here general he goes to the window the general follows de levis points stage right see the rail of my balcony and the rail of the next he holds up the cord of his dressinggown stretching his arms out ive measured it with this just over seven feet thats all if a man can take a standing jump on to a narrow bookcase four feet high and balance there hed make nothing of that and look here he goes out on the balcony and returns with a bit of broken creeper in his hand and holds it out into the light someones stood on that the stalks crushed the inner corner too where hed naturally stand when he took his jump back canynge after examining it stiffly that other balcony is young dancys mr de levis a soldier and a gentleman this is an extraordinary insinuation de levis accusation canynge what de levis i have intuitions general its in my blood i see the whole thing dancy came up watched me into the bathroom tried my door slipped back into his dressingroom saw my window was open took that jump sneaked the notes filled the case up with these wrenched the creeper there he points stage left for a blind jumped back and slipped downstairs again it didnt take him four minutes altogether canynge very gravely this is outrageous de levis dancy says he was downstairs all the time you must either withdraw unreservedly or i must confront you with him de levis if hell return the notes and apologise ill do nothing except cut him in future he gave me that filly you know as a hopeless weed and hes been pretty sick ever since that he was such a flat as not to see how good she was besides hes hard up i know canynge after a vexed turn up and down the room its mad sir to jump to conclusions like this de levis not so mad as the conclusion dancy jumped to when he lighted on my balcony canynge nobody could have taken this money who did not know you had it de levis how do you know that he didnt canynge do you know that he did de levis i havent the least doubt of it canynge without any proof this is very ugly de levis i must tell winsor de levis angrily tell the whole blooming lot you think ive no feelers but ive felt the atmosphere here i can tell you general if i were in dancys shoes and he in mine your tone to me would be very different canynge suavely frigid im not aware of using any tone as you call it but this is a private house mr de levis and something is due to our host and to the esprit de corps that exists among gentlemen de levis since when is a thief a gentleman thick as thieves a good motto isnt it canynge thats enough he goes to the door but stops before opening it now look here i have some knowledge of the world once an accusation like this passes beyond these walls no one can foresee the consequences captain dancy is a gallant fellow with a fine record as a soldier and only just married if hes as innocent as christ mud will stick to him unless the real thief is found in the old days of swords either you or he would not have gone out of this room alive it you persist in this absurd accusation you will both of you go out of this room dead in the eyes of society you for bringing it he for being the object of it de levis society do you think i dont know that im only tolerated for my money society cant add injury to insult and have my money as well thats all if the notes are restored ill keep my mouth shut if theyre not i shant im certain im right i ask nothing better than to be confronted with dancy but if you prefer it deal with him in your own way for the sake of your esprit de corps canynge pon my soul mr de levis you go too far de levis not so far as i shall go general canynge if those notes arent given back winsor comes in winsor well de levis im afraid thats all we can do for the present so very sorry this should have happened in my house canynge alter a silence theres a development winsor mr de levis accuses one of your guests winsor what canynge of jumping from his balcony to this taking the notes and jumping back ive done my best to dissuade him from indulging the fancy without success dancy must be told de levis you can deal with dancy in your own way all i want is the money back canynge drily mr de levis feels that he is only valued for his money so that it is essential for him to have it back winsor damn it this is monstrous de levis ive known ronald dancy since he was a boy canynge you talk about adding injury to insult de levis what do you call such treatment of a man who gave you the mare out of which you made this thousand pounds de levis i didnt want the mare i took her as a favour canynge with an eye to possibilities i venture to think the principle guides a good many transactions de levis as if flicked on a raw spot in my race do you mean canynge coldly i said nothing of the sort de levis no you dont say these things any of you canynge nor did i think it de levis dancy does winsor really de levis if this is the way you repay hospitality de levis hospitality that skins my feelings and costs me a thousand pounds canynge go and get dancy winsor but dont say anything to him winsor goes out canynge perhaps you will kindly control yourself and leave this to me de levis turns to the window and lights a cigarette winsor comes back followed by dancy canynge for winsors sake dancy we dont want any scandal or fuss about this affair weve tried to make the police understand that to my mind the whole thing turns on our finding who knew that de levis had this money its about that we want to consult you winsor kentman paid de levis round the corner in the further paddock he says de levis turns round from the window so that he and dancy are staring at each other canynge did you hear anything that throws light dancy as it was your filly originally we thought perhaps you might dancy i no canynge didnt hear of the sale on the course at all dancy no canynge then you cant suggest any one who could have known nothing else was taken you see dancy de levis is known to be rolling as i am known to be stony canynge there are a good many people still rolling besides mr de levis but not many people with so large a sum in their pocketbooks dancy he won two races de levis do you suggest that i bet in ready money dancy i dont know how you bet and i dont care canynge you cant help us then dancy no i cant anything else he looks fixedly at de levis canynge putting his hand on dancys arm nothing else thank you dancy dancy goes canynge puts his hand up to his face a moments silence winsor you see de levis he didnt even know youd got the money de levis very conclusive winsor well you are there is a knock on the door and the inspector enters inspector im just going gentlemen the grounds im sorry to say have yielded nothing its a bit of a puzzle canynge youve searched thoroughly inspector we have general i can pick up nothing near the terrace winsor after a look at de levis whose face expresses too much hm youll take it up from the other end then inspector inspector well well see what we can do with the bookmakers about the numbers sir before i go gentlemen youve had time to think it over theres no one you suspect in the house i suppose de leviss face is alive and uncertain canynge is staring at him very fixedly winsor emphatically no de levis turns and goes out on to the balcony inspector if youre coming in to the racing tomorrow sir you might give us a call ill have seen kentman by then winsor right you are inspector good night and many thanks inspector youre welcome sir he goes out winsor gosh i thought that chap with a nod towards the balcony was going to look here general we must stop his tongue imagine it going the rounds they may never find the real thief you know its the very devil for dancy canynge winsor dancys sleeve was damp winsor how dyou mean canynge quite damp its been raining the two look at each other winsor i i dont follow his voice is hesitative and lower showing that he does canynge it was coming down hard a minute out in it would have been enough he motions with his chin towards the balcony winsor hastily he must have been out on his balcony since canynge it stopped before i came up half an hour ago winsor hes been leaning on the wet stone then canynge with the outside of the upper part of the arm winsor against the wall perhaps there may be a dozen explanations very low and with great concentration i entirely and absolutely refuse to believe anything of the sort against ronald dancy in my house dash it general we must do as wed be done by it hits us all it hits us all the things intolerable canynge i agree intolerable raising his voice mr de levis de levis returns into view in the centre of the open window canynge with cold decision young dancy was an officer and is a gentleman this insinuation is pure supposition and you must not make it do you understand me de levis my tongue is still mine general if my money isnt canynge unmoved must not youre a member of three clubs you want to be member of a fourth no one who makes such an insinuation against a fellowguest in a country house except on absolute proof can do so without complete ostracism have we your word to say nothing de levis social blackmail hm canynge not at all simple warning if you consider it necessary in your interests to start this scandalno matter how we shall consider it necessary in ours to dissociate ourselves completely from one who so recklessly disregards the unwritten code de levis do you think your code applies to me do you general canynge to anyone who aspires to be a gentleman sir de levis ah but you havent known me since i was a boy canynge make up your mind a pause de levis im not a fool general i know perfectly well that you can get me outed canynge icily well de levis sullenly ill say nothing about it unless i get more proof canynge good we have implicit faith in dancy there is a moments encounter of eyes the generals steady shrewd impassive winsors angry and defiant de leviss mocking a little triumphant malicious then canynge and winsor go to the door and pass out de levis to himself rats curtain act ii scene i afternoon three weeks later in the card room of a london club a fire is burning left a door right leads to the billiardroom rather left of centre at a card table lord st erth an old john bull sits facing the audience to his right is general canynge to his left augustus

rings st erth by the way canynge young de levis was blackballed canynge what st erth i looked in on my way down canynge sits very still and winsor utters a disturbed sound borring but of ccourse he was general what did you expect a footman enters footman yes my lord st erth what won the cambridgeshire footman rosemary my lord sherbet second barbizon third nine to one the winner winsor thank you thats all footman goes borring rosemary and de levis sold her but he got a good pprice i suppose the other three look at him st erth many a slip between price and pocket young man canynge cut they cut

opened and major colford appears a lean and moustached cavalryman borring hallo ccolford colford general something in the tone of his voice brings them all to a standstill colford i want your advice young de levis in there he points to the billiardroom from which he has just come has started a blasphemous story canynge one moment mr borring dyou mind colford it makes no odds general four of us in there heard him hes saying it was ronald dancy robbed him down at winsors the fellows mad over losing the price of that filly now shes won the cambridgeshire borring all ears dancy great sscott colford dancys in the club if he hadnt been id have taken it on myself to wring the bounders neck winsor and borring have risen st erth alone remains seated canynge after consulting st erth with a look ask de levis to be good enough to come in here borring you might see that dancy doesnt leave the club we shall want him dont say anything to him and use your tact to keep people off borring goes out followed by colford winsor result of hearing he was blackballed pretty slippy canynge st erth i told you there was good reason when i asked you to back young de levis winsor and i knew of this insinuation i wanted to keep his tongue quiet its just wild assertion to have it bandied about was unfair to dancy the duel used to keep peoples tongues in order st erth hm it never settled anything except who could shoot straightest colford reappearing de levis says hes nothing to add to what he said to you before on the subject canynge kindly tell him that if he wishes to remain a member of this club he must account to the committee for such a charge against a fellow member four of us are here and form a quorum colford goes out again st erth did kentman ever give the police the numbers of those notes winsor winsor he only had the numbers of two the hundred and one of the fifties st erth and they havent traced em winsor not yet as he speaks de levis comes in he is in a highlycoloured not to say excited state colford follows him de levis well general canynge its a little too strong all this a little too strong under emotion his voice is slightly more exotic canynge calmly it is obvious mr de levis that you and captain dancy cant both remain members of this club we ask you for an explanation before requesting one resignation or the other de levis youve let me down canynge what de levis well i shall tell people that you and lord st erth backed me up for one club and asked me to resign from another canynge its a matter of indifference to me sir what you tell people st erth drily you seem a venomous young man de levis ill tell you what seems to me venomous my lord chasing a man like a pack of hounds because he isnt your breed canynge you appear to have your breed on the brain sir nobody else does so far as i know de levis suppose i had robbed dancy would you chase him out for complaining of it colford my god if you repeat that canynge steady colford winsor you make this accusation that dancy stole your money in my house on no proof no proof and you expect dancys friends to treat you as if you were a gentleman thats too strong if you like de levis no proof bentman told me at newmarket yesterday that dancy did know of the sale he told goole and goole says that he himself spoke of it to dancy winsor well if he did de levis dancy told you he didnt know of it in general canynges presence and mine to canynge you cant deny that if you want to canynge choose your expressions more nicely please de levis proof did they find any footmarks in the grounds below that torn creeper not a sign you saw how he can jump he won ten pounds from me that same evening betting on what he knew was a certainty thats your dancy a common sharper canynge nodding towards the billiardroom are those fellows still in there colford colford yes canynge then bring dancy up will you but dont say anything to him colford to de levis you may think yourself damned lucky if he doesnt break your neck he goes out the three who are left with de levis avert their eyes from him de levis smouldering i have a memory and a sting too yes my lord since you are good enough to call me venomous to canynge i quite understand im marked for coventry now whatever happens well ill take dancy with me st erth to himself this club has always had a decent quiet name winsor are you going to retract and apologise in front of dancy and the members who heard you de levis no fear st erth you must be a very rich man sir a jury is likely to take the view that money can hardly compensate for an accusation of that sort de levis stands silent canynge courts of law require proof st erth he can make it a criminal action winsor unless you stop this at once you may find yourself in prison if you can stop it that is st erth if i were young dancy nothing should induce me de levis but you didnt steal my money lord st erth st erth youre deuced positive sir so far as i could understand it there were a dozen ways you could have been robbed it seems to me you value other mens reputations very lightly de levis confront me with dancy and give me fair play winsor aside to canynge is it fair to dancy not to let him know canynge our duty is to the club now winsor we must have this cleared up colford comes in followed by borring and dancy st erth captain dancy a serious accusation has been made against you by this gentleman in the presence of several members of the club dancy what is it st erth that you robbed him of that money at winsors dancy hard and tense indeed on what grounds is he good enough to say that de levis tense too you gave me that filly to save yourself her keep and youve been mad about it ever since you knew from goole that i had sold her to kentman and been paid in cash yet i heard you myself deny that you knew it you had the next room to me and you can jump like a cat as we saw that evening i found some creepers crushed by a weight on my balcony on that side when i went to the bath your door was open and when i came back it was shut canynge thats the first we have heard about the door de levis i remembered it afterwards st erth well dancy dancy with intense deliberation ill settle this matter with any weapons when and where he likes st erth drily it cant be settled that way you know very well you must take it to the courts unless he retracts dancy will you retract de levis why did you tell general canynge you didnt know kentman had paid me in cash dancy because i didnt de levis then kentman and goole lied for no reason dancy thats nothing to do with me de levis if you were downstairs all the time as you say why was your door first open and then shut dancy being downstairs how should i know the wind probably de levis i should like to hear what your wife says about it dancy leave my wife alone you damned jew st erth captain dancy de levis white with rage thief dancy will you fight de levis youre very smartdead men tell no tales no bring your action and we shall see dancy takes a step towards him but canynge and winsor interpose st erth thatll do mr de levis we wont keep you he looks round kindly consider your membership suspended till this matter has been threshed out de levis tremulous with anger dont trouble yourselves about my membership i resign it to dancy you called me a damned jew my race was old when you were all savages i am proud to be a jew au revoir in the courts he goes out and silence follows his departure st erth well captain dancy dancy if the brute wont fight what am i to do sir st erth weve told you take action to clear your name dancy colford you saw me in the hall writing letters after our game colford certainly i did you were there when i went to the smoking room canynge how long after you left the billiardroom colford about five minutes dancy its impossible for me to prove that i was there all the time canynge its for de levis to prove what he asserts you heard what he said about goole dancy if he told me i didnt take it in st erth this concerns the honour of the club are you going to take action dancy slowly that is a very expensive business lord st erth and im hard up i must think it over he looks round from face to face am i to take it that there is a doubt in your minds gentlemen colford emphatically no canynge thats not the question dancy this accusation was overheard by various members and we represent the club if you dont take action judgment will naturally go by default dancy i might prefer to look on the whole thing as beneath contempt he turns and goes out when he is gone there is an even longer silence than after de leviss departure st erth abruptly i dont like it winsor ive known him all his life colford you may have my head if he did it lord st erth he and i have been in too many holes together by gad my toe itches for that fellows butt end borring im sorry but has he ttaken it in quite the right way i should have thought hearing it ssuddenly colford bosh winsor its perfectly damnable for him st erth more damnable if he did it winsor borring the courts are bbeastly distrustful dont you know colford his words good enough for me canynge were as anxious to believe dancy as you colford for the honour of the army and the club winsor of course hell bring a case when hes thought it over st erth what are we to do in the meantime colford if dancys asked to resign you may take my resignation too borring i thought his wanting to ffight him a bit screeny colford wouldnt you have wanted a shot at the brute a law court pah winsor yes whatll be his position even if he wins borring damages and a stain on his ccharacter winsor quite so unless they find the real thief people always believe the worst colford glaring at borring they do canynge there is no decent way out of a thing of this sort st erth no rising it leaves a bad taste im sorry for young mrs dancy poor woman borring are you going to play any more st erth abruptly no sir good night to you canynge can i give you a lift he goes out followed by canynge borring after a slight pause well i shall go and take the ttemperature of the club he goes out colford damn that effeminate stammering chap what can we do for dancy winsor winsor colford a slight pause the general felt his coat sleeve that night and it was wet colford well what proofs that no by george an old school fellow a brother officer and a pal winsor if he did do it colford he didnt but if he did id stick to him and see him through it if i could winsor walks over to the fire stares into it turns round and stares at colford who is standing motionless colford yes by god curtain scene ii note this should be a small set capable of being set quickly within that of the previous scene morning of the following day the dancys flat in the sitting room of this small abode mabel dancy and margaret orme are sitting full face to the audience on a couch in the centre of the room in front of the imaginary window there is a fireplace left with fire burning a door below it left and a door on the right facing the audience leads to a corridor and the outer door of the flat which is visible their voices are heard in rapid exchange then as the curtain rises so does mabel mabel but its monstrous margaret of course she lights a cigarette and hands the case to mabel who however sees nothing but her own thoughts de levis might just as well have pitched on me except that i cant jump more than six inches in these skirts mabel its wicked yesterday afternoon at the club did you say ronny hasnt said a word to me why margaret with a long puff of smoke doesnt want you bothered mabel butgood heavensme margaret havent you found out mabel that he isnt exactly communicative no desperate character is mabel ronny margaret gracious wives are at a disadvantage especially early on youve never hunted with him my dear i have he takes more sudden decisions than any man i ever knew hes taking one now ill bet mabel that beast de levis i was in our room next door all the time margaret was the door into ronnys dressingroom open mabel i dont know i i think it was margaret well you can say so in court any way not

wouldnt you were in high frocks well st offert got damages but he also got the hoof underneath he lives in ireland there isnt the slightest connection so far as i can see mabel between innocence and reputation look at me mabel well fight it tooth and nail margaret mabel youre pure wool right through everybodys sorry for you mabel its for him they ought margaret again handing the cigarette case do smoke old thing mabel takes a cigarette this time but does not light it it isnt altogether simple general canynge was there last night you dont mind my being beastly frank do you mabel no i want it margaret well hes all for esprit de corps and that but he was awfully silent mabel i hate halfhearted friends loyalty comes before everything margaret yees but loyalties cut up against each other sometimes you know mabel i must see ronny dyou mind if i go and try to get him on the telephone margaret rather not mabel goes out by the door left poor kid she curls herself into a corner of the sofa as if trying to get away from life the bell rings margaret stirs gets up and goes out into the corridor where she opens the door to lady adela winsor whom she precedes into the sittingroom enter the second murderer dyou know that child knew nothing lady a where is she margaret telephoning adela if theres going to be an action we shall be witnesses i shall wear black georgette with an ecru hat

seen ronny dancy do the maddest things for no mortal reason except the risk hes had a past you know lady a oh do tell margaret he did splendidly in the war of course because it suited him but just before dont you remember a very queer bit of riding lady a no margaret most daredevil thing but not quite you must remember it was awfully talked about and then of course right up to his marriage she

fond of each other margaret thats the mistake the general isnt mentioning the coat is he lady a oh no it was only to charles mabel returns margaret did you get him mabel no hes not at tattersalls nor

you tell me dancy i wanted to see de levis again first mabel that wretch how dare he darling she suddenly clasps and kisses him he does not return the kiss but remains rigid in her arms so that she draws away and looks at him its hurt you awfully i know dancy look here mabel apart from that muck this is a ghastly tamecat sort of life lets cut it and get out to nairobi i can scare up the money for that mabel aghast but how can we everybody would say ronny let them we shant be here mabel i couldnt bear people to think dancy i dont care a damn what people think monkeys and cats i never could

suddenly and grips hers dancy you are a little brick mabel pressing his hand to her breast and looking into his face do you know what margaret called you ronny no mabel a desperate character dancy ha im not a tame cat any more than she the bell rings mabel goes out to the door and her voice is heard saying coldly mabel will you wait a minute please returning its de levis to see you in a low voice let me see him alone first just for a minute do dancy after a moments silence go ahead he goes out into the bedroom mabel going to the door right come in de levis comes in and stands embarrassed yes de levis with a slight bow your husband mrs dancy mabel he is in why do you want to see him de levis he came round to my rooms just now when i was out he threatened me yesterday i dont choose him to suppose im afraid of him mabel with a great and manifest effort at selfcontrol mr de levis you are robbing my husband of his good name de levis sincerely i admire your trustfulness mrs dancy mabel staring at him how can you do it what do you want whats your motive you cant possibly believe that my husband is a thief de levis unfortunately mabel how dare you how dare you dont you know that i was in our bedroom all the time with the door open do you accuse me too de levis no mrs dancy mabel but you do i must have seen i must have heard de levis a wifes memory is not very good when her husband is in danger mabel in other words im lying de levis no your wish is mother to your thought thats all mabel after staring again with a sort of horror turns to get control of herself then turning back to him mr de levis i appeal to you as a gentleman to behave to us as you would we should behave to you withdraw this wicked charge and write an apology that ronald can show de levis mrs dancy i am not a gentleman i am only a damned jew yesterday i might possibly have withdrawn to spare you but when my race is insulted i have nothing to say to your husband but as he wishes to see me ive come please let him know mabel regarding him again with that look of horror slowly i think what you are doing is too horrible for words de levis gives her a slight bow and as he does so dancy comes quickly in left the two men stand with the length of the sofa between them mabel behind the sofa turns her eyes on her husband who has a paper in his right hand de levis you came to see me dancy yes i want you to sign this de levis i will sign nothing dancy let me read it i apologise to captain dancy for the reckless and monstrous charge i made against him and i retract every word of it de levis not much dancy you will sign de levis i tell you this is useless i will sign nothing the charge is true you wouldnt be playing this game if it werent im going youll hardly try violence in the presence of your wife and if you try it anywhere else look out for yourself dancy mabel i want to speak to him alone mabel no no de levis quite right mrs dancy black and tan swashbuckling will only make things worse for him dancy so you shelter behind a woman do you you skulking cur de levis takes a step with fists clenched and eyes blazing dancy too stands ready to spring the moment is cut short by mabel going quickly to her husband mabel dont ronny its undignified he isnt worth it dancy suddenly tears the paper in two and flings it into the fire dancy get out of here you swine de levis stands a moment irresolute then turning to the door he opens it stands again for a moment with a smile on his face then goes mabel crosses swiftly to the door and shuts it as the outer door closes then she stands quite still looking at her husband her face expressing a sort of startled suspense dancy turning and looking at her well do you agree with him mabel what do you mean dancy that i wouldnt be playing this game unless mabel dont you hurt me dancy yes you dont know much of me mabel mabel ronny dancy what did you say to that swine mabel her face averted that he was robbing us turning to him suddenly ronny you didnt id rather know dancy ha i thought that was coming mabel covering her face oh how horrible of me how horrible dancy not at all the thing looks bad mabel dropping her hands if i cant believe in you who can going to him throwing her arms round him and looking up into his face ronny if all the world id believe in you you know i would dancy thats all right mabs thats all right his face above her head is contorted for a moment then hardens into a mask well what shall we do lets go to that lawyer lets go mabel oh at once dancy all right get your hat on mabel passes him and goes into the bedroom left dancy left alone stands quite still staring before him with a sudden shrug of his shoulders he moves quickly to his hat and takes it up just as mabel returns ready to go out he opens the door and crossing him she stops in the doorway looking up with a clear and trustful gaze as the curtain falls act iii scene i three months later old mr jacob twisdens room at the offices of twisden graviter in lincolns inn fields is spacious with two large windows at back a fine old fireplace right a door below it and two doors left between the windows is a large table sideways to the window wall with a chair in the middle on the righthand side a chair against the wall and a clients chair on the left hand side graviter twisdens much younger partner is standing in front of the righthand window looking out on to the fields where the lamps are being lighted and a taxis engine is running down below he turns his sanguine shrewd face from the window towards a grandfather dock between the doors left which is striking four the door left forward is opened young clerk entering a mr gilman sir to see mr twisden graviter by appointment young clerk no sir but important he says graviter ill see him the clerk goes graviter sits right of table the clerk returns ushering in an oldish man who looks what he is the proprietor of a large modern grocery store he wears a dark overcoat and carries a pot hat his gingerygrey moustache and muttonchop whiskers give him the expression of a cat graviter sizing up his social standing mr gilman yes gilman doubtfully mr jacob

gilman well my business here no if youll excuse me id rather wait and see old mr jacob twisden its delicate and id like his experience graviter with a shrug very well then perhaps youll go in there he moves towards the door left back gilman thank you following you see ive never been mixed up with the law graviter opening the door no gilman and i dont want to begin when you do you dont know where youll stop do you you see ive only come from a sense of duty and other reasons graviter not uncommon gilman producing card this is my card gilmans several branches but this is the ead graviter scrutinising card exactly gilman grocery i daresay you know me or your wife does they say old mr jacob twisden refused a knighthood if its not a rude question why was that graviter ask him sir ask him

like to hear mr jacob on that winsor hell be in directly winsor they had kentman and goole the inspector the other bobby my footman dancys banker and his tailor graviter did we shake kentman or goole winsor very little oh by the way the numbers of those two notes were given and i see theyre published in the evening papers i suppose the police wanted that i tell you what i find graviter a general feeling that theres something behind it all that doesnt come out graviter the public wants its moneys worth always does in these society cases they brew so long beforehand you see winsor theyre looking for something lurid margaret when i was in the bog i thought they were looking for me taking out her cigarette case i suppose i mustnt smoke mr graviter graviter do margaret wont mr jacob have a fit graviter yes but not till youve gone margaret just a whiff she lights a cigarette winsor suddenly its becoming a sort of dreyfus case people taking sides quite outside the evidence margaret there are more of the chosen in court every day mr graviter have you noticed the two on the jury graviter with a smile no i cant say margaret oh but quite distinctly dont you think they ought to have been challenged graviter de levis might have challenged the other ten miss orme margaret dear me now i never thought of that as she speaks the door left forward is opened and old mr jacob twisden comes in he is tallish and narrow sixtyeight years old grey with narrow little whiskers curling round his narrow ears and a narrow bowribbon curling round his collar he wears a long narrowtailed coat and strapped trousers on his narrow legs his nose and face are narrow shrewd and kindly he has a way of narrowing his shrewd and kindly eyes his nose is seen to twitch and snig twisden ah how are you charles how do you do my dear margaret dear mr jacob im smoking isnt it disgusting but they dont allow it in court you know such a pity the judge might have a hookah oh wouldnt he look sweet the darling twisden with a little oldfashioned bow it does not become everybody as it becomes you margaret margaret mr jacob how charming with a slight grimace she puts out her cigarette graviter man called gilman waiting in there to see you specially twisden directly turn up the light would you graviter graviter turning up the light excuse me he goes winsor look here mr twisden twisden sit down sit down my dear and he himself sits behind the table as a cup of tea is brought in to him by the young clerk with two marie biscuits in the saucer will you have some margaret margaret no dear mr jacob twisden charles winsor no thanks the door is closed twisden dipping a biscuit in the tea now then winsor the general knows something which on the face of it looks rather queer now that hes going to be called oughtnt dancy to be told of it so that he may be ready with his explanation in case it comes out twisden pouring some tea into the saucer without knowing i cant tell you winsor and margaret exchange looks and twisden drinks from the saucer margaret tell him charles winsor well it rained that evening at meldon the general happened to put his hand on dancys shoulder and it was damp twisden puts the saucer down and replaces the cup in it they both look intently at him twisden i take it that general canynge wont say anything hes not compelled to say margaret no of course but mr jacob they might ask they know it rained and he is such a george washington twisden toying with a pair of tortoiseshell glasses they didnt ask either of you stillno harm in your telling dancy winsor id rather you did it margaret margaret i daresay she mechanically takes out her cigarettecase catches the lift of twisdens eyebrows and puts it back winsor well well go together i dont want mrs dancy to hear margaret do tell me mr jacob is he going to win twisden i think so margaret i think so margaret itll be too frightful if he doesnt get a verdict after all this but i dont know what we shall do when its over ive been sitting in that court all these three days watching and its made me feel theres nothing we like better than seeing people skinned well byebye bless you twisden rises and pats her hand winsor half a second margaret wait for me she nods and goes out mr twisden what do you really think twisden i am dancys lawyer my dear charles as well as yours winsor well can i go and see canynge twisden better not winsor if they get that out of him and recall me am i to say he told me of it at the time twisden you didnt feel the coat yourself and dancy wasnt present then what canynge told you is not evidence hell stop your being asked winsor thank goodness goodbye winsor goes out twisden behind his table motionless taps his teeth with the eyeglasses in his narrow wellkept hand after a long shake of his head and a shrug of his rather high shoulders he snips goes to the window and opens it then crossing to the door left back he throws it open and says twisden at your service sir gilman comes forth nursing his pot hat be seated twisden closes the window behind him and takes his seat gilman taking the clients chair to the left of the table mr twisden i believe my names gilman head of gilmans department stores you have my card twisden looking at the card yes what can we do for you gilman well ive come to you from a sense of duty sir and also a feelin of embarrassment he takes from his breast pocket an evening paper you see ive been followin this dancy case its a good deal talked of in putney and i read this at halfpast two this afternoon to be precise at he rises and hands the paper to twisden and with a thick gloved forefinger indicates a passage when i read these numbers i appened to remember givin change for a fiftypound note dont often ave one in you know so i went to the cashbox out of curiosity to see that i adnt got it well i ad and here it is he draws out from his breast pocket and lays before twisden a fiftypound banknote it was brought in to change by a customer of mine three days ago and he got value for it now thats a stolen note it seems and youd like to know what i did mind you that customer of mine ive known im well eight or nine years an italian he is wine salesman and so fars i know a respectable manforeignlookin but nothin more now this was at alfpast two and i was at my head branch at putney where i live i

you brought this to me and you got value for it well that man was taken aback if im a judge mr twisden he was taken aback not to speak in a guilty way but he was as you might say flummoxed now i said to him where did you get it thats the point he took his time to answer and then he said well mr gilman he said you know me i am an honourable man i cant tell you offhand but i am above the board hes foreign you know in his expressions yes i said thats all very well i said but here ive got a stolen note and youve got the value for it now i tell you i said what im going to do im going straight with

it as he speaks graviter comes in by the door left forward twisden pointing to the newspaper and the note mr gilman has brought this of which he is holder for value his customer who changed it three

is a family matter sare i twisden let me be frank with you telling his points off on his fingers we have your admission that you changed this stopped note for value it will be our duty to inform the bank of england that it has been traced to you you will have to account to them for your possession of it i suggest to you that it will be far better to account frankly to us ricardos taking out a handkerchief and quite openly wiping his hands and forehead i received this note sare with others from a gentleman sare in settlement of a debt of honour and i know nothing of where he got them twisden hm that is very vague if that is all you can tell us im afraid ricardos gentlemen this is very painful for me it is my daughters good name he again wipes his brow twisden come sir speak out ricardos desperately the notes were a settlement to her from this gentleman of whom she was a great friend twisden suddenly i am afraid we must press you for the name of the gentleman ricardos sare if i give it to you and it does im arm what will my daughter say this is a bad matter for me he behaved well to her and she is attached to him still sometimes she is crying yet because she lost him and now we betray him perhaps who knows this is very unpleasant for me taking up the paper here it gives the number of another note a undredpound note i ave that too he takes a note from his breast pocket graviter how much did he give you in all ricardos for my daughters settlement one thousand pounds i understand he did not wish to give a cheque because of his marriage so i did not think anything about it being in notes you see twisden when did he give you this money ricardos the middle of octobare last twisden suddenly looking up mr ricardos was it captain dancy ricardos again wiping his forehead gentlemen i am so fond of my daughter i have only the one and no wife twisden with an effort yes yes but i must know ricardos sare if i tell you will you give me your good word that my daughter shall not hear of it twisden so far as we are able to prevent it certainly ricardos sare i trust you it was captain dancy a long pause graviter suddenly were you blackmailing him twisden holding up his hand my partner means did you press him for this settlement ricardos i did think it my duty to my daughter to ask that he make compensation to her twisden with threats that you would tell his wife ricardos with a shrug captain dancy was a man of honour he said of course i will do this i trusted him and a month later i did remind him and he gave me this money for her i do not know where he got it i do not know gentlemen i have invested it all on her every pennyexcept this note for which i had the purpose to buy her a necklace that is the sweared truth twisden i must keep this

ricardos out and take his address ricardos pressing his hands over the breast of his frock coat with a sigh gentlemen i beg you remember what i said with a roll of his eyes my daughter i am not happee goodday he turns and goes out slowly left forward followed by graviter twisden to himself young dancy he pins the two notes together and places them in an envelope then stands motionless except for his eyes and hands which restlessly express the disturbance within him graviter returns carefully shuts the door and going up to him hands him ricardos card looking at the card villa benvenuto this will have to be verified but im afraid its true that man was not acting graviter whats to be done about dancy twisden can you understand a gentleman graviter i dont know sir the war loosened form all

that train he bends over the abc curtain scene ii the same room on the following morning at tentwentyfive by the grandfather clock the young clerk is ushering in dancy whose face is perceptibly harder than it was three months ago like that of a man who has lived under great restraint dancy he wanted to see me before the court sat young clerk yes sir mr twisden will see you in one minute he had to go out of town last night he prepares to open the waitingroom door dancy were you in the war young clerk yes dancy how can you stick this young clerk with a smile my trouble was to stick that sir dancy but you get no excitement from years end to years end itd drive me mad young clerk shyly a case like this is pretty exciting id give a lot to see us win it dancy staring at him why what is it to you young clerk i dont know sir its its like football you want your side to win he opens the waitingroom door expanding you see some rum starts too in a lawyers office in a quiet way dancy enters the waitingroom and the young clerk shutting the door meets twisden as he comes in left forward and takes from him overcoat top hat and a small bag young clerk captain dancys waiting sir he indicates the waiting room twisden narrowing his lips very well mr graviter gone to the courts young clerk yes sir twisden did he leave anything for me young clerk on the table sir twisden taking up an envelope thank you the clerk goes twisden opening the envelope and reading all corroborates hm he puts it in his pocket and takes out of an envelope the two notes lays them on the table and covers them with a sheet of blottingpaper stands a moment preparing himself then goes to the door of the waiting room opens it and says now captain dancy sorry to have kept you waiting dancy entering winsor came to me yesterday about general canynges evidence is that what you wanted to speak to me about twisden no it isnt that dancy looking at his wrist watch by me its just on the halfhour sir twisden yes i dont want you to go to the court dancy not twisden i have very serious news for you dancy wincing and collecting himself oh twisden these two notes he uncovers the notes after the court rose yesterday we had a man called ricardos here a pause is there any need for me to say more dancy unflinching no what now twisden our duty was plain we could not go on with the case i have consulted sir frederic he felt he felt that he must throw up his brief and he will do that the moment the court sits now i want to talk to you about what youre going to do dancy thats very good of you considering twisden i dont pretend to understand but i imagine you may have done this in a moment of reckless bravado feeling perhaps that as you gave the mare to de levis the money was by rights as much yours as his stopping dancy who is about to speak with a gesture to satisfy a debt of honour to this lady and no doubt to save your wife from hearing of it from the man ricardos is that so dancy to the life twisden it was mad captain dancy mad but the question now is what do you owe to your wife she doesnt dream i suppose dancy with a twitching face no twisden we cant tell what the result of this collapse will be the police have the theft in hand they may issue a warrant the money could be refunded and the costs paid somehow that can all be managed but it may not help in any case what end is served by your staying in the country you cant save your honour thats gone you cant save your wifes peace of mind if she sticks to you do you think she will dancy not if shes wise twisden better go theres a war in morocco dancy with a bitter smile good old morocco twisden will you go then at once and leave me to break it to your wife dancy i dont know yet twisden you must decide quickly to catch a boat train many a man has made good youre a fine soldier dancy there are alternatives twisden now go straight from this office youve a passport i suppose you wont need a visa for france and from

graviter and canynge enter goodmorning general to graviter well graviter sir frederic got up at once and said that since the publication of the numbers of those notes information had reached him which forced him to withdraw from the case great sensation of course i left bromley in charge therell be a formal verdict for the defendant with costs have you told dancy twisden yes hes in there deciding

canynge colfords badly cut up margaret orme and colford enter colford striding forward there must be some mistake about this mr twisden twisden hssh dancys in there hes admitted it voices are subdued at once colford what with emotion if it were my own brother i couldnt feel it more but damn it what right had that fellow to chuck up the case without letting him know too i came down with dancy this morning and he knew nothing about it twisden coldly that was unfortunately unavoidable colford guilty or not you ought to have stuck to him its not playing the game mr twisden twisden you must allow me to judge where my duty lay in a very hard case colford i thought a man was safe with his solicitor canynge colford you dont understand professional etiquette colford no thank god twisden when you

by his chair dancy between him and the door right de levis comes in and shuts the door he is advancing towards twisden when his eyes fall on dancy and he stops twisden you wanted to see me de levis moistening his lips yes i came to say that that i overheard i am afraid a warrant is to be issued i wanted you to realise its not my doing ill give it no support im content i dont want my money i dont even want costs dancy do you understand dancy does not answer but looks at him with nothing alive in his face but his eyes twisden we are obliged to you sir it was good of you to come de levis with a sort of darting pride dont mistake me i didnt come because i feel christian i am a jew i will take no money not even that which was stolen give it to a charity im proved right and now im done with the damned thing goodmorning he makes a little bow to canynge and twisden and turns to face dancy who has never moved the two stand motionless looking at each other then de levis shrugs his shoulders and walks out when he is gone there is a silence canynge suddenly you heard what he said dancy you have no time to lose but dancy does not stir twisden captain dancy slowly without turning his head rather like a man in a dream dancy walks across the room and goes out curtain scene iii the dancys sittingroom a few minutes later mabel dancy is sitting alone on the sofa with a newspaper on her lap she is only just up and has a bottle of smellingsalts in her hand two or three other newspapers are dumped on the arm of the sofa she topples the one off her lap and takes up another as if she couldnt keep

be for long ill be waiting ill be waiting i swear it dancy steady mab putting her back from him now he opens the bedroom door left and stands waiting for her to go summoning up her courage she goes to open the outer door a sudden change comes over dancys face from being stony it grows almost maniacal dancy under his breath no no by god no he goes out into the bedroom closing the door behind him mabel has now opened the outer door and disclosed inspector dede and the young constable who were summoned to meldon court on the night of the theft and have been witnesses in the case their voices are heard mabel yes inspector captain dancy in madam mabel i am not quite sure i dont think so inspector i wish to speak to him a minute stay here grover now madam mabel will you come in while i see

half an hour inspector no no dont you try to undermine me im sorry for you but dont you try it he tries the handle then knocks at the door dancys voice one minute inspector its locked sharply is there another door to that room come now the bell rings moving towards the door left to the constable whos that out there constable a lady and gentleman sir inspector what lady and stand by grover dancys voice all right you can come in now there is the noise of a lock being turned and almost immediately the sound of a pistol shot in the bedroom mabel rushes to the door tears it open and disappears within followed by the inspector just as margaret orme and colford come in from the passage pursued by the constable they too all hurry to the bedroom door and disappear for a moment then colford and margaret reappear supporting mabel who faints as they lay her on the sofa colford takes from her hand an envelope and tears it open colford its addressed to me he reads it aloud to margaret in a low voice dear colford this is the only decent thing i can do its too damned unfair to her its only another jump a pistol keeps faith look after her colford my love to her and you margaret gives a sort of

look at him colford passes quickly into the bedroom followed by the inspector margaret remains kneeling beside mabel colford comes quickly back margaret looks up at him he stands very still colford neatly through the heart margaret wildly keeps faith weve all done that its not enough colford looking down at mabel all right old boy the curtain falls etext editors bookmarks feeling that such things dont happen ive nothing against them but the fact is they get on so isnt the slightest connection between innocence and reputation prejudices adela or are they loyalties scandal is heavensent at this time of year theres nothing we like better than seeing people skinned theyre more sober theyre honest and theyre everywhere we all cut each others throats from the best of motives wifes memory is not very good when her husband is in danger wives are liars by law windows by john galsworthy persons of the play geoffrey march freelance in literature joan march his wife mary march their daughter johnny march their son cook their cook mr bly their window cleaner faith bly his daughter blunter a strange young man mr barnadas in plain clothes the action passes in geofrey marchs house highgatespringtime act i thursday morning the diningroomafter breakfast act ii thursday a fortnight later the diningroom after lunch act iii the same day the diningroomafter dinner act i the marchs diningroom opens through french windows on one of those gardens which seem infinite till they are seen to be coterminous with the side walls of the house and finite at the far end because only the thick screen of acacias and sumachs prevents another house from being seen the french and other windows form practically all the outer wall of that diningroom and between them and the screen of trees lies the difference between the characters of mr and mrs march with dots and dashes of mary and johnny thrown in for instance it has been formalised by mrs march but the grass has not been cut by mr march and daffodils have sprung up there which mrs march desires for the diningroom but of which mr march says for gods sake joan let them grow about half therefore are now in a bowl on the breakfast table and the other half still in the grass in the compromise essential to lasting domesticity a hammock under the acacias shows that mary lies there sometimes with her eyes on the gleam of sunlight that comes through and a trail in the longish grass bordered with cigarette ends proves that johnny tramps there with his eyes on the ground or the stars according but all this is by the way because except for a yard or two of gravel terrace outside the windows it is all painted on the backcloth the marches have been at breakfast and the round table covered with blue linen is thick with remains seven baskets full the room is gifted with old oak furniture there is a door stage left forward a hearth where a fire is burning and a high fender on which one can sit stage right middle and in the wall below the fireplace a service hatch covered with a sliding shutter for the passage of dishes into the adjoining pantry against the wall stage left is an old oak dresser and a small writing table across the left back corner mrs march still sits behind the coffee pot making up her daily list on tablets with a little gold pencil fastened to her wrist she is personable fortyeight trim welldressed and more matteroffact than seems plausible mr march is sitting in an armchair sideways to the windows smoking his pipe and reading his newspaper with little explosions to which no one pays any attention because it is his daily habit he is a finelooking man of fifty odd with redgrey moustaches and hair both of which stiver partly by nature and partly because his hands often push them up mary and johnny are close to the fireplace stage right johnny sits on the fender smoking a cigarette and warming his back he is a commonplace looking young man with a decided jaw tall neat soulful who has been in the war and writes poetry mary is less ordinary you cannot tell exactly what is the matter with her she too is tall a little absent fair and welllooking she has a small china dog in her hand taken from the mantelpiece and faces the audience as the curtain rises she is saying in her soft and pleasant voice well what is the matter with us all johnny johnny stuck as we were in the trenches like china dogs he points to the ornament in her hand mr march into his newspaper damn these people mary if there isnt an ideal left johnny its no good pretending one johnny thats what im saying bankrupt mary what do you want mrs march to herself mutton cutlets johnny will you be in to lunch johnny shakes his head mary mary nods geof mr march into his paper swine mrs march thatll be three to herself spinach johnny if youd just missed being killed for three blooming years for no spiritual result whatever youd want something to bite on mary mrs march jotting soap johnny what price the little and weak now freedom and self determination and all that mary forty to one no takers johnny it doesnt seem to worry you mary well whats the good johnny oh youre a looker on mary mr march to his newspaper of all godforsaken timeservers mary is moved so lar as to turn and look over his shoulder a minute johnny who mary only the oldun mr march this is absolutely prussian mrs march soup lobster chicken salad go to mrs hunts mr march and this fellow hasnt the nous to see that if ever there were a moment when it would pay us to take risks and be generous my hat he ought to be knighted resumes his paper johnny muttering you see even dad cant suggest chivalry without talking of payment for it that shows how weve sunk mary contemptuously chivalry pouf chivalry was off even before the war johnny who wants chivalry johnny of all shallowpated humbug that sneering at chivalrys the worst civilisation such as weve got is built on it mary airily then its built on sand she sits beside him on the fender johnny sneering and smartness pah mary roused ill tell you what johnny its mucking about with chivalry that makes your poetry rotten johnny seizes her arm and twists it shut up that hurts johnny twists it more you brute johnny lets her arm go johnny ha so you dont mind taking advantage of the fact that you can cheek me with impunity because youre weaker youve given the whole show away mary abolish chivalry and ill make you sit up mrs march what are you two quarrelling about will you bring home cigarettes johnny not bogdogunovs mamelukes something more anglo american johnny all

johnny muttering shallow idiots thinking we can do without chivalry mrs march im doing my best to get a parlourmaid today mary but these breakfast things wont clear themselves mary ill clear them

so they reduced it to life mr march life sweet heaven bly thats what i said so they give her two years i dont hold with the sunday mercury but it put that over its a misfortune to a girl to be goodlookin mr march rumpling his hair no no dash it all beautys the only thing left worth living for bly well i like to see green grass and a blue sky but its a mistake in a uman bein look at any

round her neck as you might say i said to meself bly i said youre responsible for this if she adnt been goodlookin itd never eve appened during this speech mary has come in with a tray to clear the breakfast and stands unnoticed at the diningtable arrested by the curious words of mr bly mr march your wife might not have thought that you were wholly the cause mr bly bly ah my wife shes passed on

write something thatll make people sit up thats the way to send youth to hell how can a child whos had a rope round her neck bly who has been fumbling in his pocket produces some yellow paper cuttings clipped together heres her references the whole literature of the case and heres a letter from the chaplain in one of the prisons sayin she took a lot of interest in him a nice young man i believe he

march shake hands mr bly so do i bly wipes his hand and mr march shakes it loyaltys loyalty especially when we men benefit by it bly thats right sir mary has returned with faith bly who stands demure and pretty on the far side of the table her face an embodiment of the pathetic watchful prison faculty of adapting itself to whatever may be best for its owner at the moment at this moment it is obviously best for her to look at the ground and yet to take in the faces of mr march and mary without their taking her face in a moment for all of considerable embarrassment mr march suddenly well here we are the remark attracts faith she raises her eyes to his softly with a little smile and drops them again so you want to be our parlourmaid faith yes please mr march well faith can remove

faith comes in glancing at him she resumes her placing of the decanters as johnny enters by the window and comes down to his father by the hearth johnny privately if you havent begun your morning dad you might just tell me what you think of these verses he puts a sheet of notepaper before his father who takes it and begins to con over the verses thereon while johnny looks carefully at his nails mr march er i i like the last line awfully johnny johnny gloomily what about the other eleven mr march tentatively well old man i er think perhaps itd be stronger if they were out johnny good god he takes back the sheet of paper clutches his brow and crosses to the door as he passes faith she looks up at him with eyes full of expression johnny catches the look jibs ever so little and goes out cooks voice through the door which is still ajar faith faith puts the decanters on the table and goes quickly out mr march who has seen this little byplay to himself in a voice of dismay oh oh i wonder curtain act ii a fortnight later in the marchs diningroom a day of violent april showers lunch is over and the table littered with remains twelve baskets full mr march and mary have lingered mr march is standing by the hearth where a fire is burning filling a fountain pen mary sits at the table opposite pecking at a walnut mr march examining his fingers what it is to have an inky present suffer with me mary mary weep ye no more sad fountains why need ye flow so fast mr march pocketing his pen coming with me to the british museum i want to have a look at the assyrian reliefs mary dad have you noticed johnny mr march i have mary then only mother hasnt mr march ive always found your mother extremely good at seeming not to notice things mary mary faith shes got on very fast this

with a glad eye that belongs to some one else mary laughing no but seriously dad johnnys not like you and me why not speak to mr bly mr march mr blys eyes are not glad mary dad do be serious johnnys capable of anything except a sense of humour mr march the girls past makes it impossible to say anything to her mary well i warn you johnnys very queer just now hes in the lose the world to save your soul mood it really is too bad of that girl after all we did what most people wouldnt mr march come get your hat on mary or we shant make the tube before the next shower mary going to the door something must be done mr march as you say something ah mr bly mr bly in precisely the same case as a fortnight ago with his pail and cloths is coming in bly afternoon sir shall i be disturbing you if i do the winders here mr march not at all mr bly crosses to the windows mary pointing to mr blys back try bly showery sir mr march ah bly very tryin for winders resting my daughter givin satisfaction i hope mr march with difficulty er in her work i believe coming on well but the question is mr bly do er any of us ever really give satisfaction except to ourselves bly taking it as an invitation to his philosophical vein ah thats one as goes to the roots of uman nature theres a lot of disposition in all of us and what i always say is one mans disposition is another mans indisposition mr march by george just hits the mark bly filling his sponge question is how far are you to give rein to your disposition when i was in durban natal i knew a man who had the biggest disposition i ever come across e struck is wife e smoked opium e was a liar e gave all the rein e could and yet withal one of the pleasantest men i ever met mr march perhaps in giving rein he didnt strike you bly with a big wipe following his thought he said to me once joe he said if i was to hold meself in i should be a devil theres where you get it policemen priests prisoners cabnet ministers any one who leads an unnatural life see how it twists em you cant suppress a thing without it swellin you up in another place mr march and the moral of that is bly follow your instincts you see if im not keepin you now that we aint got no faith as we were sayin the other day no ten commandments in black an white weve just got to be uman beins raisin cain and havin feelin hearts whats the use of all these lofty ideas that you cant live up to liberty fraternity equality democracy see what comes o fightin for em ere we arewipin out the lot we thought they was fixed stars they was only comets hot air no trust uman nature i say and follow your instincts mr march we were talking of your daughter i i bly theres a case in point her instincts was starved goin on for three years because mind you they kept her hangin about in prison months before they tried her i read your article and i thought to meself after id finished which would i feel smallest if i was the judge the jury or the ome secretary it was a treat that article they ought to abolish that inuman to be hanged by the neck until she is dead its my belief they only keep it because its poetry that and the wigs theyre hard up for a bit of beauty in the courts of law excuse my and sir i do thank you for that article he extends his wiped hand which mr march shakes with the feeling that he is always shaking mr blys hand mr march but apropos of your daughter mr bly i suppose none of us ever change our natures bly again responding to the appeal that he senses to his philosophical vein ah but oo can see what our natures are why ive known people that could see nothin but theirselves and their own families unless they was drunk at my daughters trial i see right into the lawyers judge and all there she was hub of the whole thing and all they could see of her was ow far she affected em personally one tryin to get er guilty the other tryin to get er off and the judge summin er up coldblooded mr march but thats what theyre paid for mr bly bly ah but which of em was thinkin eres a little bit o warm life on its own eres a little dancin creature whats she feelin wots er complaint impersonallike i like to see a man do a bit of speculatin with his mind off of imself for once mr march the man that hath not speculation in his soul bly thats right sir when i see a mangy cat or a dog thats lost or a fellowcreature down on his luck i always try to put meself in his place its a weakness ive got mr march warmly a deuced good one shake he checks himself but mr bly has wiped his hand and extended it while the shake is in progress mary returns and having seen it to a safe conclusion speaks mary coming dad mr march excuse me mr bly i must away he goes towards the door and bly dips his sponge mary in a low voice well mr march mr bly is like all the greater men i know he cant listen mary but you were shaking mr march yes its a weakness we have every three minutes mary bubbling dad silly mr march very as they go out mr bly pauses in his labours to catch as it were a philosophical reflection he resumes the wiping of a pane while quietly behind him faith comes in with a tray she is dressed now in lilaccoloured linen without a cap and looks prettier than ever she puts the tray down on the sideboard with a clap that attracts her fathers attention and stands contemplating the debris on the table bly winders there they are clean dirty all sorts all round yer winders faith with disgust food bly ah food and winders thats life faith eight times a day four times for them and four times for us i hate food she puts a chocolate into her mouth bly ave some philosophy i might just as well hate me winders faith well she begins to clear bly regarding her look ere my girl dont you forget that there aint many winders in

domesticity mrs march if she doesnt go johnny must are you going to turn him out mr march of course not we must reason with him mrs march reason with young people whose lips were glued together half an hour ago why ever did you force me to take this girl mr march ruefully one cant always resist a kindly impulse joan what does mr bly say to it mrs march mr bly follow your instincts and then

go about with his head in the air but he always picked himself up like a little man mary listen they all listen the distant sounds of a concertina being played with fury drift in through the open door cook dont it sound eavenly the concertina utters a long wail curtain act iii the marchs diningroom on the same evening at the end of a perfunctory dinner mrs march sits at the diningtable with her back to the windows mary opposite the hearth and mr march with his back to it johnny is not present silence and gloom mr march we always seem to be eating mrs march youve eaten nothing mr march pouring himself out a liqueur glass of brandy but not drinking it its humiliating to think we cant exist without relapses into gloom mrs march mary pass him the walnuts mary i was thinking of taking them up to johnny mr march looking at his watch hes been there six hours even he cant live on faith mrs march if johnny wants to make a martyr of himself i cant help it mary how many days are you

towards seeing reason he pours brandy into a liqueur glass from the decanter which stands between them mrs march puts the brandy to her lips and makes a little face then swallows it down manfully mary gets up with the walnuts and goes silence gloom mrs march horrid stuff mr march havent you begun to see that your policys hopeless joan come tell the girl she can stay if we make johnny feel victorious we can deal with him its just personal pride the curse of this world both you and johnny are as stubborn as mules mrs march human nature is stubborn geof thats what you easy going people never see mr march gets up vexed and goes to the fireplace mr march turning well this goes further than you think it involves johnnys affection and respect for you mrs march nervously refills the little brandy glass and again empties it with a grimacing shudder mr march noticing thats better youll begin to see things presently mary reenters mary hes been digging himself in hes put a screen across the head of the stairs and got cooks blankets hes going to sleep there mrs march did he take the walnuts mary no he passed them in to her he says hes on hunger strike but hes eaten all the chocolate and smoked himself sick hes having the time of his life mother mr march there you are mrs march wait till this time tomorrow mary cooks been up again he wouldnt let her pass shell have to

her hand over her brow and sits down again she is stumped with consideration for her defeat have another tot he pours it out let mary go up with a flag of truce and ask them both to come down for a thorough discussion of the whole thing on condition that they can go up again if we dont come to terms mrs march very well im quite willing to meet him i hate quarrelling with johnny mr march good ill

end why not let her stay and make johnny promise only to see her in the presence of a third party mrs march because shed see him every day while he was looking for the third party shed help him look for it mary with a gurgle mother id no idea you were so french mrs march it seems to me you none of you have any idea what i am mary well do remember that therell be no publicity to make either of you

little glass of brandy she remains seated mary is on her right mr march leads into the room and stands next his daughter then faith in hat and coat to the left of the table and johnny pale but determined last assembled thus in a half fan of which mrs march is the apex so to speak they are all extremely embarrassed and no wonder suddenly mary gives a little gurgle johnny youd think it
