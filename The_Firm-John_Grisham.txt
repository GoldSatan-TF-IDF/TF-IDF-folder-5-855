chapter one mitchell mcdeere mitchell y mcdeere was twentyfive years old he was about to graduate in the top five from harvard law school he had a beautiful wife abby he was white handsome tall and physically fit he didnt take drugs or drink too much and he was hungry he wanted it all money power a big house a fast car he urgently wanted to succeed in other words he was perfect for the memphis law firm of bendini lambert locke every one of the twenty partners in the firm was given a thick file on him they knew that he had been born in poverty in kentucky and brought up by his mother after his fathers death they knew that she had wasted the money the army gave her after her eldest sons death in vietnam and that only the other brother ray had cared for him they knew that he had won a place at western kentucky university because he was good at football and had graduated top of his class they could see the poverty hurt and that he wanted to climb away from it now he was about to leave harvard two firms in new york and one in chicago were interested in him according to the file the highest offer was and the lowest was all the partners agreed that he was the one they wanted they needed a new associate this year and they wanted it to be him the first interview in a hotel near harvard went well oliver lambert took with him lamar quin an associate who had been with the firm for seven years and offered mitch a new bmw and help in buying a house mitch was interested of course lambert invited him down to memphis to visit the firm he said he would send the air tickets the figure of started mitch and abby dreaming eighty thousand in memphis is the same as one hundred and twenty thousand in new york mitch said well be able to afford almost anything we want and its only the money ill start at in two years ill be into six figures they say that on average an associate becomes a partner in about ten years and then ill be earning about half a million dollars a year and what about the car and the house who wants new york abby said smiling and thinking about their rusty mazda and about new furniture in a big old house and dreaming of babies what sort of work is it taxes mitch said which is what i enjoy and we both hate the cold weather in the northeast the firm specializes in international tax law bendini started it in he had a lot of clients in the south so he moved down to memphis and obviously everyone who works there loves it they say that members very rarely leave the firm and youd be closer to ray true if theyre offering so much why doesnt everybody know about them and try to work there lambert says they like to stay small there are only fortyone members in all they get one new member every two years and they approach him rather than the other way round why would they help us with a house abby asked its important to the firm that their members stay happy and look rich it helps to bring business in memphis here we come said abby i like this firm already chapter two bendini lambert and locke bendini had loved the firms office building he had also loved secrecy before his death in he had filled the yearold building with electronic surveillance equipment as well as with every luxury money could buy only a few special members could enter certain parts of the building in twenty years bendini built the richest law firm in memphis it was also definitely the quietest every associate hired by the firm was taught the evils of a loose tongue everything was secret especially clients business young associates were warned that talking about the firms business outside the firm could delay the prize of a partnership nothing left the building on front street wives were told not to ask questions or were lied to the associates were expected to work hard keep quiet and spend their healthy incomes lamar quin met mitch at the entrance to the building after an embarrassing speech by oliver lambert in front of all the other associates in the secondfloor library lamar took him on a tour of the office there were excellent libraries on the first four floors of the fivefloor building so that no member needed to leave the office to find out anything the first four floors were almost the same the centre of each floor was filled with secretaries their desks and the necessary machines on one side of the open area was the library and on the other were offices and smaller conferencerooms partners got the large corner offices with wonderful views over the river and the city you wont see any pretty secretaries lamar said softly as they watched them work these are the best legal secretaries in memphis but they also have to be over a certain age the firm likes its members to have steady marriages babies are encouraged of course wives are not forbidden to work i hope not said mitch puzzled by the word forbidden he decided to change the subject does every lawyer get his own secretary yes until youre a partner then youll get another and by then youll need one nathan locke has three all with twenty years experience and he keeps them busy youll find that the work takes at least eighty hours a week at first and theres always more if you want it everyone works a hundred hours a week during tax season we get well paid all right but we earn it believe me what about holidays two weeks a year for the first five years i know that doesnt sound like very much but the firm does own a couple of beach houses in the cayman islands and you can usually get one for your holiday as long as a partner doesnt want it of course we do a lot of business in the caymans as well because the islands are taxfree nathan lockes there at the moment in fact which is why you cant meet him today mitch had lunch with the partners in their special diningroom on the fifth floor again the generous public praise was embarrassing but pleasing mitch wanted a beer to help him feel comfortable but looking round he saw that no one had any alcohol and he learned that drinking at lunchtime was not liked by the firm nor was heavy drinking at any time they wanted members they could rely on that was all right with mitch he was determined to succeed by the time mitch left the building in the evening after a meeting with royce mcknight to discuss further details of his contract he had decided there could be no better offer in the whole country chapter three the fifth floor there were no law offices on the fifth floor of the bendini building the partners diningroom and kitchen filled the west end then in the centre there were some empty rooms and then there was a wall in the centre of the wall was a small metal door with a button beside it and a camera over it this opened on to a small room where an armed guard watched the door and studied a large number of television surveillance screens a hall went past the offices and workrooms of a number of men whose job was to watch and to gather information the windows to the outside world were painted over devasher the head of security had the largest of these small plain offices on the monday after mitch mcdeeres visit oliver lambert stood in front of the small metal door and stared at the camera over it he pushed the button waited and was finally allowed in he walked quickly along the hall and entered devashers office they talked a bit about mcdeere devasher reported that as far as he and his men could tell mitch would not be a security risk for the firm he played lambert a tape of phone calls from mitchs hotel room in memphis to abby in massachusetts very loving conversations you see ollie devasher said with an evil grin on his face theyre just like a newly married couple ill try to get you some bedroom pictures later i know how much you enjoy those she is lovely shut up devasher lambert said and then after a pause i wish we could find his brother ray we know everything about his family and hers but we just cant find this brother dont worry ollie devasher said well find him devasher closed the mcdeere file and opened another much thicker one lambert stared at the floor whats the latest he asked softly its not good news ollie kozinski and hodge are definitely working together now last week the fbi checked kozinskis house and found our bugs kozinski told hodge when they were hiding in the thirdfloor library now they think everythings bugged and theyre very careful where they talk which fbi agent is involved tarrance he seems to be in charge how often has he talked to kozinski theres no way to know we know of four meetings in the last month but i suspect more theyre being real careful how much has he given them not much i hope theyre still trying to persuade him hes frightened hodge hasnt talked to the fbi yet i dont think hell do whatever kozinski does what have you told lazarov everything thats my job they want you in chicago the day after tomorrow they want answers and plans what plans plans to get rid of kozinski hodge and tarrance if it becomes necessary tarrance are you crazy we cant get rid of an fbi agent lazarov is stupid ollie you know that and thats what he wants from you of course if he does kill tarrance the fbi will be all over the place and all of you lawyers will suddenly have to leave the country try to argue with him will you and watch mcdeere for another month ok ollie dont worry chapter four sad news when the mcdeeres moved down to memphis they stayed with the quins the two couples became good friends it didnt take mitch and abby long to find a house to buy on a street called east meadowbrook after they moved in they were completely happy the new house was everything they had dreamed about large comfortable and in a good neighbour hood abby went mad buying furniture while mitch drove the new black bmw all around town getting to know the area the thursday before mitch was due to start work they drove over to the quins house for dinner now that youve spent next years income on furniture mitch said on the way there what next oh i dont know abby said how about babies hey slow down let me get settled first abby laughed and sat back in her seat mitch admired her legs when did i last tell you were beautiful he asked about two hours ago two whole hours how thoughtless of me right dont let it happen again they parked behind the quins two mercedes kay met them at the front door her eyes were red from crying oh kay whats the matter abby asked theres theres been a tragedy she said who is it mitch asked kay wiped her eyes and breathed deeply two members of the firm marty kozinski and joe hodge were killed today we were very close to them mitch remembered them from his visit to the firm what happened he asked no ones sure kay said they were on grand cayman diving there was some kind of explosion on the boat and we think they drowned a boatman was also killed there was a meeting in the firm a few hours ago and they were all told about it lamar could hardly drive home where is he mitch asked by the swimmingpool hes waiting for you lamar was just sitting there deep in shock mitch sat down next to him and waited lamar shook his head and tried to speak but no words came his eyes were red and he looked hurt finally mitch said lamar im so sorry i wish i could say something theres nothing to say marty kozinski was one of my best friends he was going to be the next partner he was a great lawyer one we all admired our our children always played together mitch and abby drove home in silence four days later instead of starting behind his desk at the office mitch and his lovely wife joined the remaining thirtynine members of the firm and their lovely wives and said goodbye to marty kozinski and joe hodge oliver lambert gave such a beautiful speech that even mitchell mcdeere who had buried a father and a brother was moved close to tears abbys eyes watered at the sight of the widows and children chapter five long hours mitch learned fast he was appointed to work with one of the partners avery tolleson and helped him with several of his clients he learned to respect averys talent for hard work avery taught mitch all about billing clients for his time as an associate he could bill an hour his future progress at the firm he was warned depended on how much income he made for the firm he learned that it was acceptable to bill clients more than he actually worked if you think about a client while youre driving over to the office in the morning avery told him add on another hour he could bill clients for twelve hours a day even if he never worked twelve hours a day mitch also learned that avery liked to bend the firms rules his marriage was breaking up and his eyes followed every goodlooking woman he saw on the streets he also drank at lunchtimes from avery and the other partners mitch learned the way things were done at bendini lambert locke he learned that secrecy was valued highly he learned to talk to no one outside the firm not even abby mitch was determined to become a partner in less time than anyone else ever had before he was determined to earn the firm more money than any associate ever had before he had heard the stories about how many hours people worked even sixteen hours a day was not unknown in the firm it was said that nathan locke started work at six am every day on his first full day mitch arrived at the office at no one else was there he climbed the stairs to his office on the second floor made himself a cup of coffee and began to work after a while he got up from his desk and went over to the window it was still dark outside he didnt notice the figure suddenly appear at his door good morning mitch turned round from the window you frightened me he said im sorry im nathan locke i dont believe weve met im mitch mcdeere the new man they shook hands yes i know mitch could not stop himself staring at the mans eyes nathan lockes eyes were cold and knowing they were the most evil eyes he had ever seen i see youre an early riser locke was saying yes sir well its good to have you in the firm after a few days devasher lambert and locke had a meeting they were sure mitch could not keep going nobody could work a hundred hours a week for more than a few months hows his wife taking it lambert asked this will change but at the moment i can only hear his side of the conversations devasher said shes not delighted shes practicing her cooking for the first time and hes getting sandwiches from the shops because hes never home in time for dinner what do you mean this will change asked locke i mean chicago is still worried you know we dont think kozinski and hodge told the fbi anything important but lazarov wants to be safe he wants the homes of all associates bugged dont you think thats going a bit too far asked lambert chicago doesnt think so all of them even mcdeere yes i think tarrance will try again oh and before i forget weve found mcdeeres brother ray or rather mcdeere led us to him hes in brushy mountain prison near nashville he accidentally killed someone in a bar fight and the court gave him fifteen years hes done four of them mcdeere went to visit him last sunday i wonder if we could use this as a lever against mcdeere if we ever need to chapter six a tiny microphone mitch didnt slow down he became a machine he had never needed as much sleep as other people and now this was to his advantage however much work avery tolleson threw at him he managed to get through it sometimes he worked all through the night and found an unsmiling abby waiting for him when he came home at dawn for a quick shower before returning to the office oliver lambert invited the mcdeeres the quins and two other associates and their wives to dinner one saturday at justines his favourite restaurant not long after mitch and abby entered the restaurant two men with the correct key entered the shiny black bmw in the car park of justines they drove away from the restaurant to the new home of mr and mrs mcdeere they parked the bmw in its usual place the driver got another key out of his pocket and the two men entered the house they worked quickly and quietly a tiny microphone no bigger than a fingernail was stuck into the mouthpiece of each phone in the house the signals from these microphones would go to a receiver in the space under the roof of the house then the men turned their attention to each room a small hole was made in the corner of every room high up where no one would notice it a tiny microphone was placed inside each hole a wire no thicker than a human hair and completely invisible ran from each microphone to the receiver the receiver looked exactly like an old broken radio and it joined other old objects that were already there in a corner under the roof it would not be noticed for months maybe years and if it was noticed it would simply be thrown away as rubbish the receiver of course would also send signals from the house back to the fifth floor at bendini lambert locke just as the fish was served at justines the bmw parked quietly next to the restaurant the driver locked the car door it was the mahans next at least they lived closer to the restaurant than the mcdeeres and had a smaller house so the work would be easier on the fifth floor of the bendini building devasher stared at rows of lights and waited for some signal from east meadowbrook the dinner party had finished thirty minutes earlier and it was time to listen a tiny yellow light shone weakly and he put a pair of headphones on he pushed a button to record he waited a green light marked mcd began to shine it was the bedroom the voices started to come in loud and clear i dont like jill mahan the female voice mrs mcdeere was saying her husbands ok but shes really unpleasant are you drunk asked mr mcdeere almost im ready for sex devasher bent his head closer towards his surveillance equipment to listen better take your clothes off mrs mcdeere demanded we havent done this for a while said mr mcdeere and whose fault is that she asked i havent forgotten how youre beautiful get in the bed she said devasher closed his eyes and watched them chapter seven tarrance on the first monday in august a general meeting was called in the main library on the first floor every member was there the mood was quiet and sad beth kozinski and laura hodge were politely brought in by oliver lambert they were seated at the front of the room in front of them on the wall were pictures of their husbands oliver lambert stood with his back to the wall and gave a speech he almost whispered at first but the power of his voice made every sound clear throughout the room he looked at the two widows and told of the deep sadness the firm felt and how they would always be taken care of as long as there was a firm he talked of marty and joe of their first few years with the firm of their importance to the firm he spoke of their love for their families the widows held hands and cried softly kozinskis and hodges closest friends like lamar quin and doug turney were wiping their eyes after the speech mitch went over to look at the pictures there were three other pictures on the wall as well one was of a woman underneath the picture were the words alice knauss he had heard about her the only woman ever to become a member of the firm she was killed in a car crash just three years after joining the other two pictures were of robert lamm and john mickel he asked avery about them lamm was out hunting in arkansas one day in and didnt return he was found eventually with a bullet in his head everyone supposed it was a hunting accident mickel shot himself in five dead lawyers in fifteen years it was a dangerous place to work mitch was always the first to arrive at the office and often the last to leave as well the partners were delighted with his progress and rewarded him with extra money abby got a job as a teacher at a local school so that she wasnt just sitting around the house bored mitchs ability to work long hours was already a legend but she didnt want to be married to a legend she wanted a fleshandblood person next to her recently mitch had started having his lunch sometimes in a small cafe about half a mile from the bendini building it was a dark hole in the wall with few customers and bad food he liked it because no one else from the firm went there so he could sit quietly and read legal documents while he ate he could always bill the client for his time one day while he was there a stranger approached his table and stood next to it mitch put down his document can i help you he asked the stranger said youre mcdeere arent you mitch studied him judging by his accent he was from new york he was about forty with short hair and was wearing a cheap suit yeah he said who are you in reply the man pulled a badge out of his pocket wayne tarrance fbi he waited for a reaction sit down mitch said thanks after he sat down tarrance said i heard you were the new man at bendini lambert locke why would that interest the fbi we watch that firm quite closely why i cant tell you at the moment we have our reasons but i didnt come here to talk about them i came here to meet you and to warn you about the firm im listening mitch said three things first dont trust anyone second every word you say at home or in the office is probably being recorded mitch watched and listened carefully tarrance was enjoying this and the third thing he asked money doesnt grow on trees what do you mean by that i cant say more at the moment i think you and i will become very close i want you to trust me and i know ill have to earn your trust so i dont want to move too fast we cant meet at your office or at my office and we cant talk on the phone so from time to time ill come and find you for now just remember those three things and be careful heres my home phone number you wont want to call me yet but youll need it sometime but call me only from a pay phone if im not in leave a message on the machine mitch put it in his shirt pocket theres one other thing tarrance said as he stood up you had better know that hodges and kozinskis deaths werent accidental he looked down at mitch with both hands in his pockets smiled and left before mitch could ask any more questions the next day mitch had an opportunity to go and see lamar he walked into his office and closed the door we need to talk he said if he believed tarrance the office was bugged and the conversation would be recorded he was not sure whom to believe you sound serious lamar said did you ever hear of someone called wayne tarrance no fbi lamar closed his eyes fbi he whispered thats right he had a badge and everything where did you meet him he found me in lanskys cafe on union street he knew who i was have you told avery no no one except you im not sure what to do lamar picked up the phone and spoke to avery tolleson within a few minutes mitch and lamar were up in lamberts office avery lambert royce mcknight harold okane and nathan locke were there sitting around a conference table have a seat said locke with a false smile whats that mitch pointed to a tape recorder in the centre of the table we dont want to miss anything locke said ok mitch said he repeated his conversation with tarrance locke stared at mitch with his dark eyes while he was speaking and as soon as he had finished he asked have you ever seen this man before never whom did you tell only lamar your wife no did he leave you a phone number to call no the tape recorder was switched off locke walked to the window mitch he said weve had trouble with the fbi and the tax people for several years now some of our clients like us to take risks for them we do things for them which are not quite illegal but which are close to the edge and like any firm of tax lawyers with clients as rich as ours the fbi occasionally has to investigate some of our clients naturally they investigate us at the same time tarrance is new down here and hes trying to score a big win hes dangerous you are not to speak to him again how many of our clients have the courts found guilty mitch asked not a single one what about marty and joe what did happen thats a good question we dont know its true that it was possibly not an accident the boatman who was with them seems to have been a drug smuggler according to the police there i dont think well ever know mcknight added were trying to protect their families so were calling it an accident dont mention any of this to anyone locke said not even your wife if tarrance contacts you again let us know immediately understand yes sir mitch nodded the grandfatherly warmth returned to oliver lamberts face he smiled and said mitch we know this is frightening but were used to it we can look after it leave it to us and dont worry and stay away from tarrance further contact with tarrance will put your future in the firm at risk locke said i understand mitch said thats all mitch lambert said you and lamar can go back to work now as soon as they were out of the room lambert called devasher on the phone within two minutes lambert and locke were sitting in devashers office did you listen locke asked yeah of course we heard every word the boy said you handled it very well i think hes frightened and will run from tarrance but ive got to tell lazarov hes the boss i hope i can still persuade him not to kill tarrance god yes lambert said but why did they choose mcdeere do you think because hes young and because hes a good person the kind of person who wouldnt like whats going on here i suggest you keep mcdeere so busy he doesnt have time to think and it would be a good idea for quin to get closer to him too so that if mcdeere does want to tell anyone anything hell naturally turn to quin did he tell his wife last night asked locke were checking the tapes now devasher said itll take about an hour weve got so many bugs in this city it takes six computers to find anything ill let you know if i find anything but he and his wife dont talk that much anymore mcdeere had better visit the caymans though can you arrange it of course said lambert but why ill tell you later chapter eight four people three of them dead that sunday mitch went to visit his brother ray in prison again there was some information he wanted they chatted for a while and then mitch said you once told me in a letter that you knew a prisoner who used to be a cop in memphis and now works there as a private investigator i cant remember his name eddie lomax yeah cops are hated in here i helped him out once in a fight they were killing him we became friends he still writes to me hes been out about three years now thanks why do you need him a lawyer friends wife is cheating on him is lomax good yeah i think so hes made some money anyway youll find him in the phone book a guard walked by and reminded them that it was nearly time for visitors to leave is there anything i can send you asked mitch any language tapes ray had learned several languages while he was in prison yeah something on greek please and a picture of abby and of your house youre the first mcdeere in a hundred years to own a house ok ill see you next month lomaxs secretary tammy was blonde about forty years old but still sexy she wore short skirts and a lowcut blouse she kept crossing and uncrossing her legs while mitch was waiting for lomax to get off the phone when mitch eventually got into the office lomax stood up behind his desk and held out his hand so youre mitchell mcdeere its good to meet you my pleasure mitch said i saw ray on sunday i feel like ive known you for years he talked about you all the time you look just like him too now what can i do for you have you got trouble with your wife no nothing like that i need some information about four people three of them are dead mitch told him about the three dead lawyers from bendini lambert locke i want to know if theres anything odd about their deaths he said sounds interesting what about the fourth person hes called wayne tarrance hes an fbi agent here in memphis fbi thatll cost you more ok this must all be absolutely secret eddie im trusting you and dont call me at home or at the office i suspect im being watched very closely by whom i wish i knew chapter nine grand cayman a week later avery tolleson and mitch left for the cayman islands to do some tax work for a client it was the first time in his life that mitch had left the country they landed on grand cayman a jewel of land surrounded by clear blue sea hardly anyone lived on the other two islands little cayman and cayman brac avery told him and on grand cayman there were only people but businesses had their head offices there on paper and there were banks they settled into the firms apartments on seven mile beach and avery suggested they go to rumheads an openair bar on the beach as night fell avery was drinking heavily and a pair of sisters joined them at their table they were dressed only in bikinis soon one of them was sitting on averys knees and the other one was trying to persuade mitch to dance with her he pushed her away roughly and went for a walk along the beach in the darkness all alone on the beach with only the stars in the sky and the lights of a few boats far away out on the water another beautiful woman approached him she reminded him of abby they lay on the sand and talked she quietly took off her bikini not that there was much of it and asked mitch to look after it while she went for a swim when she came back rising out of the water and brushing her long wet hair off her face and body they made love who will ever know mitch thought im not doing anyone any harm in the morning neither of them felt like doing business in the taxi to the royal bank of montreal where they had an appointment avery cheerfully explained that he was different from the rest of the partners in the firm because he liked drinking and women after they had completed their business at the bank avery went off to meet the woman he had spent the night with leaving mitch to wander around the town they had another appointment at three in the afternoon mitch went to the library and found a newspaper for june of that year he sat down beside a window to read it he looked out of the window and saw a man getting out of a car and crossing the street towards the library he recognized the car he had also seen it near the bank in the morning mitch got up from the table and pretended to be looking at a business magazine in another part of the room the man who was small and dark came into the library in a few minutes he appeared in the room where mitch was he walked past mitch paused as if to check what he was reading and left the room when mitch returned to the window he was back in the car smoking a cigarette mitch read the newspaper story about the explosion on the boat which had killed two american lawyers and their diving guide he left the library and without looking back walked quickly along narrow crowded streets and in and out of shops until he was sure no one could be following him then he caught a taxi to abanks diving school the newspaper had said that the guide who was killed was philip abanks the son of barry abanks who owned the diving school abanks agreed to speak to mitch he was certain philip had nothing to do with drugs the accident had surprised him because the boat was found a long way from where it was supposed to be but philip hadnt used the radio to tell the school about their new position as an experienced boatman like himself would he also hadnt radioed about any engine trouble the boats engine exploded but the three bodies were found unharmed in full diving clothes they had just drowned although all three were experienced divers a few days later in memphis devasher studied the photographs on the desk in front of him they were of a very high quality the long distance nightsight camera had worked well and the girl was excellent he would use her again mitchell mcdeere he said to himself with a smile now you are ours now youll do anything for us chapter ten dangerous waters two weeks before christmas mitch and eddie lomax met on a bridge in a park in the freezing rain they had both made sure that they were not followed lomaxs news was very interesting all three of the dead lawyers had died in mysterious circumstances the lorry which killed alice knauss had been stolen in st louis three days earlier the driver drove straight into her car and then ran away he was never found the hunter robert lamm was almost certainly murdered it didnt look like a hunting accident because his body was found in a part of the forest where there were few animals and the hunters didnt usually go there were two strange things about mickels death first the letter to his wife was typed not handwritten second he had never bought a gun in his life and yet the gun that killed him was an old gun which the police thought criminals had used in the past where did a respectable lawyer get such a gun your firm has lost five lawyers in fifteen years lomax ended and youre acting as if youre going to be the next id say youve got problems what about tarrance i dont have very much hes one of their best men he came down here from new york about two years ago thanks ill do anything i can to help ray mcdeeres little brother it seems to me that youre swimming in dangerous waters mitch nodded slightly but said nothing mitch sat in the corner of paulettes a french restaurant in the middle of memphis at seven oclock abby rushed in from the cold and joined him at his table whats the special event she asked mitch had said hardly anything on the phone when he invited her to meet him here he was very careful about what he said on the phone these days do i need a reason to have dinner with my wife yes its seven oclock on a monday night and youre not at the office thats very unusual a waiter came to their table and they ordered two white wines as the waiter went away mitch noticed the face of a man at another table that looked familiar before mitch could think about it the man hid his face behind a menu whats the matter mitch he put his hand on hers and said abby weve got to talk what about she asked worried about something very serious he said quietly but we cant talk here theres a back door near the washrooms i want you to go to the washroom and then leave by the back door ill meet you there ill bring your coat trust me please abby left mitch waited until the man with the menu was busy talking to a waiter and then he followed her outside they walked to a bar and sat down in a dark corner inside whats this all about demanded abby when they had their drinks i met an fbi agent today a man called tarrance its the second time hes spoken to me fbi yes with badges and everything he told her about the first meeting with tarrance and what the partners had said about it what do the fbi want i dont know abby im just eating lunch when someone comes up and tells me that my phones are bugged my home is bugged and someone at bendini lambert locke knows everything i do i dont know what they want abby but theyve chosen me for some reason did you tell anyone at the office no i havent told anyone except you and i dont intend to tell anyone either abby drank from her glass of wine our phones are bugged according to the fbi but how do they know theyre not stupid mitch if the fbi told me my phones were bugged id believe them i dont know who to believe locke and lambert were very believable when they explained how the firm fights with the tax people and the fbi but if the firm did have a rich client whom the fbi was investigating why would they choose me the new man in the firm to talk to what do i know ive seen no signs of any criminal acts all the files i work on are clean but someone is bugging you even the car tarrance said mitch this is amazing why would a law firm do that ive no idea i feel much better now that ive told you from now on ill tell you everything i didnt tell you sooner because i kept hoping it would all go away and theres more to tell you he told her about eddie lomax and the five dead lawyers and how he suspected that none of their deaths was quite what it seemed to be i feel weak abby we have to be careful we must continue to live as if we suspect nothing this is unreal mitch i cant believe im sitting here listening to you saying all this do you expect me to live in a house where everythings bugged do you have a better idea yeah lets hire this eddie lomax to inspect our house ive thought of that but what if he finds something think about it what if we know for sure that the house is bugged what then what if he breaks one of the bugs then whoever put them there will know that we know and that could be dangerous youre right anyway youre hardly home for me to talk to theyll only hear me talking to myself a lot these days chapter eleven a professional job a day or two after christmas eddie lomax was called out on an urgent job a man calling himself al kilbury said that his wife was about to meet a man in a hotel in south memphis and that he needed lomax to take photographs he tempted him with an offer of generous payment they drove to the hotel together and waited in the car park another man silently opened the back door of the car and put three bullets into the back of lomaxs head it was a professional job the killer and the man calling himself al kilbury left together mitch found the bar near the airport where tammy had asked him to meet her he looked again at the letter she had pinned to the back door of his house dear mr mcdeere please meet me at ernies bar on winchester avenue late tonight its about eddie lomax very important tammy hemphill his secretary tammy arrived soon after he had ordered a beer thanks for coming she said whats the matter she looked round we need to talk but not here where do you suggest why dont we drive around well take my car in the car she took a long time to say what she wanted to say eventually it started to come out you heard about eddie she asked yes when did you last meet him a couple of weeks before christmas i thought so he didnt keep any file about the work he was doing for you there was a pause eddie and i were we were lovers my marriage isnt so great and my husband has other women friends anyway eddie told me a little about you and he said that lawyers from your firm kept dying so much for secrecy mitch thought anyway just before christmas he told me he thought he was being followed and that he thought it was connected to the work he was doing for you eddie was good at his job it wouldnt be easy to follow him they were professionals whoever they were as professional as the killer im frightened mitch can i call you mitch of course i havent been back to the office since his death they probably think i know whatever it is that he knew youre right not to take any chances mitch said we can disappear for a while my husband and i he works as a singer in nightclubs and he can always get work somewhere else that sounds like a good idea where will you go here and there she said theyve killed all those lawyers and theyve killed eddie and next they want you and me we need to keep in touch tammy mitch said but you cant talk to me on the phone and we shouldnt meet write to me once a week from wherever you are whats your mothers name doris fine sign your letters doris do they read your mail too probably doris probably chapter twelve denton voyles mitch flew into washington on the firms private jet devasher didnt want him to go chicago had given orders that mcdeere was not to leave memphis on firm business except with at least two partners but the firm had arranged months ago for mitch to go to this conference on taxes in washington devasher couldnt argue against it because as far as he knew tarrance had only met mitch that one time and mitch had immediately reported it so mitch seemed to be a loyal member of the firm his first morning at the conference surrounded by strangers a man whispered harbison fbi and passed him a note the note read dear mr mcdeere i would like to speak to you for a few minutes during lunch please follow grant harbisons instructions thank you for your cooperation fdenton voyles voyles was the almost legendary boss of the fbi harbison arranged a meeting in the mens room he went first and mitch followed after twenty minutes what does voyles want he asked something important its not my job to tell you said harbison when the conference breaks for lunch youll find a taxi number outside the hotel it will take you to the meeting be careful two of the boys from memphis followed you here theyre in the bedroom next to you in the hotel mitch followed his instructions the driver of the taxi spoke to others constantly on his radio when he was certain that no one was following them he stopped acting like a tour guide and took mitch directly to his meeting with voyles in another hotel tarrance was waiting in the hotel room after a few minutes voyles walked in with another agent voyles offered his hand and mitch stood up to shake it thank you for coming voyles said this is very important to us mitch breathed deeply sir do you have any idea how confused and frightened i am i really need an explanation whats happening mitch what im about to tell you will certainly shock you you wont want to believe it but its all true and with your help we can save your life mitch waited no lawyer has ever left your firm alive voyles went on three have tried and they were killed two others were about to leave and they died last summer when a lawyer joins bendini lambert locke he never leaves unless he retires and keeps his mouth shut and by the time they retire they are part of it all and cannot talk the firm has a major surveillance operation on the fifth floor your house car and phones are bugged your desk and office are bugged almost every word you speak is heard and recorded on the fifth floor they follow you and sometimes your wife you see mitch the firm is not what it seems it is not owned by the partners it is part of a very large and very illegal business the firm of bendini lambert locke is owned by the morolto crime family in chicago the mafia i dont believe it mitch said frozen with fear his voice was weak voyles smiled yes you do mitch youve suspected something for some time thats why you talked to abanks in the caymans thats why you hired that investigator and got him killed by those boys on the fifth floor you know the firm is rotten mitch mitch rested his head in his hands and stared at the floor as far as we can see voyles said about a quarter of the firms clients and businesses are legal there are some very good lawyers in the firm doing tax work for rich clients its a very good cover most of the files youve worked on so far are ok thats how they operate they bring in a new man throw money at him buy the car and house take him to the caymans and put him to work on their legal clients then after five or six years when the money is really good when you and your family have become completely used to this rich way of living they tell the truth by then you cant get out even if you want to theyll kill your wife or one of your children they dont care so you stay you cant leave if you stay you make a million dollars and retire young with your family safe if you try to leave your picture will hang in the firstfloor library you mean that every partner mitch couldnt finish yes they all know and they all do what theyre told we suspect that most of the associates know as well we dont think the wives do we really want these people we could destroy the morolto family we could arrest hundreds of them how do they help the moroltos mitch asked to be honest voyles said we dont know everything weve only been watching them for about seven years and very little information gets out but heres an example a partner takes several million dollars in dirty money to the caymans on the firms private jet mitch thought of all the journeys the partners kept making to the caymans voyles continued his story then the same partner or one of the others forms a legal company back in the states to buy some land perhaps the money is wired through from the caymans to whats the name of that bank in st louis with whom the firm does a lot of business commercial guaranty thats the one the mafia own it so the money arrives back in the states and is used legally suddenly dirty money is clean thats why bendini was sent down there in locke grew up working for the moroltos hes a criminal first and a lawyer second lambert is the perfect cover for the firm he looks and sounds like everyones idea of a lawyer but the next time you see him in the office mitch remember that hes a killer what about the secretaries and support staff good question we think some of them are part of it too but some of them dont know anything thats how they operate as two firms at once a lot of the people there really are doing legal business but hodge told tarrance that theres a group of support staff who work only for the main partners of the firm they probably do all their legal work so that the partners are free to do the moroltos dirty business if you know so much why dont you just go in there and arrest them all asked mitch we need evidence voyles said thats where you come in we want you to photocopy files bank records all those documents which we cant reach from the outside but you can we need the names of all the staff we need to know who works on which files we need all the information you can give us about every part of bendini lambert locke and then eventually well want you to appear in court and be a witness our most important witness you must decide whether or not youll cooperate mitch tell us soon if you decide not to help us well find someone else who will sooner or later and well put you in prison along with the rest of them if you choose to help us we can negotiate a price and then well look after you send you and your wife anywhere in the world you want to go but the mafia never forgets mitch said ive heard stories of witnesses hidden by the fbi whose car suddenly explodes you people are capable of mistakes one day in ten years time one of you will talk to the wrong person if i help you ill always live in fear ill never be able to practice law again abby and i will have to change our faces and become mr and mrs ordinary in nowheretown its true mitch voyles said they never forget but i promise you we will look after you and your wife we have about two thousand witnesses living all over the country under new names with new homes and new jobs now you had better get back to your hotel tarrance will make contact with you soon chapter thirteen shopping for shoes abby met him at the airport and in the bar he told her everything that had happened she was frightened and close to tears but neither of them could see any way out they couldnt just run away and they couldnt do nothing even while they were talking mitch saw a tall fairhaired man with a moustache at the bar whom he remembered from the hotel in washington they were following him all the time tarrance didnt wait long a week after mitch returned to memphis about the same time that doris got in contact tarrance met him as he was walking back from a meeting and suggested they turn into a shoe shop together to get off the street he started to say that it was time for mitch to decide what to do but he suddenly stopped what is it mitch demanded i just saw someone walk by the shop and look in at us listen carefully mitch well walk out together and as soon as were outside you push me away and shout at me then run in the direction of the office mitch did exactly as tarrance suggested as soon as he got back to the bendini building he went to avery tollesons office and reported that the same fbi agent had contacted him again by the time they got to lockes office lambert and mcknight were there as well he pretended to be frightened and upset and demanded to know why the fbi had now contacted him twice lambert told him the same story as before mitch hardly heard him he watched his lips moving and thought of kozinski and hodge and their families then locke asked him what had happened today tarrance pushed me into the shoe shop i tried to run away but tarrance followed me and grabbed me i pushed him away and ran back here thats all that happened what shall i do nothing mitch said lambert just stay away from this tarrance if he even looks at you report it to us immediately thats what he did said avery mitch tried to look as pitiful as possible you can go mitch lambert said hes lying im sure hes lying devasher said they were all in devashers office what did your man see asked locke something slightly different but at the same time very different you know he says mcdeere and tarrance walked together into the shoe shop he didnt see tarrance grab mcdeere theyre in the shop for a couple of minutes our man walks by and looks inside next minute theyre fighting on the street something isnt right i tell you the partners thought for a while finally oliver lambert said look devasher its possible that mcdeere is telling the truth and that your man got the wrong signals you dont know of any contact since last august no but we cant watch anybody absolutely all the time we didnt know about those other two until it was almost too late but because you dont know of any recent contact you shouldnt doubt what mcdeeres saying im not sure said devasher i think mcdeere and i should have a little talk about what lambert asked nervously just leave it to me if you fools were in charge of security wed all be in prison by now lazarov is getting really worried but he thinks he can get someone in the fbi to talk then well know whether mcdeere is lying mitch was alone in his office late that night when a short fat man walked in my names devasher he said what can i do for you mitch asked you can listen for a while im in charge of security for the firm why does the firm need security mitch asked bendini was crazy about security anyway we believe the fbi are trying to get a man inside the firm to help in their investigations of some of our clients its important that you tell us whenever they attempt to make contact with you yes i already know that suddenly devasher was smiling evilly i brought something with me to show you he said something that will keep you honest he reached inside his jacket and pulled out an envelope mitch opened it nervously inside were four photographs black and white very clear on the beach the girl oh my god who took these mitch shouted at him what difference does that make mitch tore the photographs up and let the pieces fall on to his desk weve got plenty more upstairs devasher said calmly we dont want to use them but if we catch you talking to mr tarrance or some other fbi agent well send them to your wife how would you like that mitch the next time you and tarrance decide to shop for shoes think about us mitch because well be watching chapter fourteen two black briefcases so you want to rent a small office the agent said as they rode up in the lift he was admiring the tight jeans on the blonde she smiled and nodded the lift stopped and they got out he showed her the small two room office she liked it they negotiated a price a good price for even a small office on the ninth floor of the famous cotton shipping building she signed the forms doris greenwood by noon the next day the furniture was in place there was a knock at the door who is it she asked its your photocopier a voice answered she unlocked the door and opened it two men wheeled in a big machine and she pointed them towards the spare second room its a big copier for such a small office one of them remarked this is the most modern machine weve got it does ninety copies a minute she smiled and said it would do fine and signed the documents after they had gone she locked the door behind them and walked to the window she looked north along front street a quarter of a mile away on the opposite side the bendini building was visible on a tuesday morning mitchs secretary checked that he had everything for his meeting with frank mulholland in fifteen minutes mitch sitting at his desk pointed at a large black briefcase he finished signing the letters on the desk in front of him picked up the briefcase and a thin document case and left the building he checked that the briefcase was in his right hand and the document case in his left that was the signal on the ninth floor of the cotton shipping building tammy moved away from the window put on her coat and left the office mitch entered the building and went straight to the lifts mulhollands office was on the seventh floor mitch pushed the button he was not alone in the lift but he didnt think they had followed him here he put the briefcase down on the floor by his foot tammy got into the lift on the fourth floor she had brought with her exactly the same kind of briefcase that mitch had she didnt look at mitch but stood next to him and put her briefcase down on the floor next to his on the seventh floor mitch picked up her briefcase and left the lift on the ninth floor tammy picked up his briefcase and went to her office the briefcase was full of files from bendini lambert locke tammy locked the door behind her there were seven thick files she laid them on the table next to the copier she took the papers out of the first file and put them into the copier she pushed the print button and watched the machine make two perfect copies of every page mitchs meeting with mulholland went well they shook hands at the end and arranged another meeting next week the lift stopped on the fifth floor and tammy walked in it was empty except for mitch when the door closed he said any problems no two copies are locked away how long did it take thirty minutes the lift stopped on the fourth floor and she picked up the empty briefcase midday tomorrow she asked yes he replied the door opened and she disappeared on to the fourth floor he rode alone down to the ground floor and walked with a briefcase in each hand looking just as a lawyer should back to his office chapter fiftheen secret talks a week later mitch was having lunch with the partners in their fifth floor diningroom each year every associate member was invited twice throughout lunch mitch knew that he was being watched very closely they were looking for any signs that he was a less keen member of the firm than he used to be so he forced himself to smile and to eat the food they offered him it was impossible for him to forget the pictures of him and the girl in the sand had they all seen the pictures had they passed them around this table oliver lambert had never been so charming he told stories about past members of the firm congratulated mitch on the hours he was working and the amount of money he was earning the firm and said he deserved the holiday he was taking next week you and your wife are off to the caymans i hear royce mcknight said youll love it there do you dive asked lambert no but we plan to do plenty of swimming mitch said if you want to learn to dive lambert went on theres a man called adrian bench who has an excellent diving school on the north end of the island its worth a visit in other words stay away from abanks mitch thought thanks ill remember that he said but be careful mitch lambert said it brings back memories of marty and joe the partners looked down sadly at their plates mitch felt sick they had killed marty and joe for doing exactly what he was doing he wanted two million from the fbi there were a couple of other things he wanted too at the same time that mitch was having lunch with the partners tammy greenwood hemphill parked her dirty brown volkswagen behind the shiny peugeot in the school car park she left the engine running she got out of the car pulled a key from her pocket opened the back of the peugeot and took the heavy black briefcase out then she drove away in her own car at a small window in the teachers lounge abby drank coffee and stared through the trees into the car park she smiled and checked her watch twelvethirty as planned tammy drove back to her office no one followed her no one knew of her existence there were nine files this time he had said there would eventually be about forty she copied them all on the way back to the school she took all the copied files to the small storage room she had rented in her name at three oclock in the morning mitch got quietly out of bed and got dressed without a word he kissed abby who was awake and left the house he had a meeting at an allnight cafe twentyfive miles out of town at this time of night no one would follow him tarrance and he completed their negotiations they agreed on two million dollars i want a million now and a million later mitch said im already copying all my files no lawyer is allowed to do that as soon as i give them to you its the end of my career so when i give them to you i want the first million well discuss the details later how are you going to get the files to us tarrance asked you cant just walk around with them thats right mitch said when i hear that the first million has gone where i want it to go then ill give you the key to a storage room somewhere in the memphis area and the second million tarrance asked when you and i and voyles decide that ive given you enough documents to make the arrests you want then i get half after i appear in court as a witness for the last time i get the other half agreed tarrance said and theres one other thing i want tarrance yeah i want my brother ray out of brushy mountain prison thats ridiculous mitch we cant do that you can find a way if you cant do it by bending the rules then you can help him escape but you can do it the fbi can do anything remember ill see what i can do tarrance said helplessly but voyles isnt going to like it tell him that he doesnt get to see anything not a single file unless he promises to get my brother out not even a file on one of my clean clients i dont know why you want those files anyway because when weve got them tarrance said weve got you actually youre probably already working with criminal clients without knowing it it makes it easier for the firm to persuade you later to do whatever they say because theyll tell you that youve already done enough to go to prison chapter sixteen no kiss at eight oclock on the morning after mitch and abby returned from the caymans oliver lambert and nathan locke were allowed through the metal door on the fifth floor they went to devashers office i talked to lazarov yesterday in las vegas hes still worried he wants you to make sure that any associates who dont know about our real business here work only on clean files ok what about mcdeere lambert asked he had a wonderful week with his wife they stayed in the other house of course you should see her in a string bikini we took some pictures just for fun i didnt come here to look at pictures locke said angrily all right all right they spent a whole day with our friend abanks we dont know what they talked about whenever we got someone close to them they were only talking about fishing or something but i dont like it at all what can they talk about said lambert of course theyll talk about hodge and kozinski but theres no harm in that they cant find anything out can they no devasher admitted but i still dont like it i know mcdeere tells lies i know he lied about that shoe shop and chicago is worried so im worried thats my job as long as the fbi are around ill be worried it was very unusual for wives to appear at the bendini building abby arrived there unexpectedly the receptionist phoned up to mitchs office and his secretary came down to explain that mitch was in a meeting hes always in a meeting abby replied get him out of it she waited in mitchs office he was on the third floor in averys office helping him prepare for another visit to the caymans probably taking cash for the moroltos mitch thought his secretary found him there and told him about abby he walked down to his office where abby was walking up and down mitch i have to go and see my parents she said my father just called me at school my mothers ill shes got to have an operation tomorrow im sorry mitch said he didnt touch her she wasnt crying ive told the school ill be away for a while she said how long i dont know mitch we need some time away from each other i think it will be good for both of us lets talk about it youre always too busy to talk ive been trying to talk to you for six months but you cant hear me ill be back i promise i just dont know when i love you mitch he watched her open the door there was no kiss on the fifth floor an engineer pushed the emergency button for vashers office he came immediately and put headphones on he listened when did this happen two minutes ago in his office second floor shes leaving him isnt she hell shes our best lever what good are those photographs if shes leaving him anyway abby started for kentucky but didnt arrive there she made sure that she wasnt being followed and then went to nashville airport from there she flew to the caymans avery finished his business at the royal bank of montreal and after changing his clothes made his way to rumheads bar just after he arrived tammy nervously entered the crowd and sat at the bar she was wearing a bikini which hardly covered her body she was forty but twenty pairs of hungry eyes followed her to the bar where she ordered a soft drink and lit a cigarette she went over to averys table and asked if she could sit down he couldnt believe his luck of all the men in the bar she had picked him im avery tolleson from memphis nice to meet you im libby what brings you here avery asked just looking for fun she said with a suggestive look in her eyes for three hours they dined drank and danced each time a little more closely she got him drunk at ten oclock she led him from the bar to the firms beach house where he was staying he attacked her at the front door and they kissed long and deeply when they were inside she suggested that they should have one more drink he left the room to go to the washroom she took a small plastic packet from her bag and dropped some sleepingpowder into his drink mitch had told her it was enough to put him to sleep for ten hours when he returned she watched closely as he swallowed his drink he was too drunk to taste a thing within minutes he was in a deep sleep she pushed him off the chair and pulled him into the bedroom she laid him on the bed and took his clothes off she kissed him goodnight in his jacket pocket she found two keyrings with eleven keys on them downstairs in the hall between the kitchen and the sitting room she found the mysterious metal door which mitch had noticed when he stayed in this house with avery last year from the arrangement of the upstairs rooms mitch guessed that there was a small room behind the door she opened the door waited a full ten minutes for any alarm and then turned on the light inside the room were twelve cupboards for files a desk and three large briefcases she checked that avery was still deeply asleep then she went back downstairs grabbed the three briefcases turned off the lights and left through the front door it was a short walk across the car park to where the neighbouring hotel started she was sweating from the weight of the briefcases by the time she reached room and knocked on the door abby opened the door any problems she asked no tammy put the briefcases on the bed and went to get a coke where is he in bed i think weve got until six in the morning there are a hell of a lot of files in that room well be lucky to finish by six room was a single hotel room all the furniture had been pushed against the walls to make room for the photocopier abby had rented tammy began to photocopy the files from the briefcases while abby went out in her car and had the keys copied by a man she had found earlier when she came back she continued with the photocopying while tammy went back to the beach house she filled two suitcases with files from the cupboards by the time she got back to the hotel abby had finished with the briefcases and tammy took them back her arms soon ached from carrying the suitcases full of files from one place to the other they managed to copy the files from ten of the cupboards before avery showed any signs of beginning to wake up she left the files they were copying with abby went back to the beach house locked the metal door and returned the keys then she took off her bikini top got into bed beside him and waited avery finally woke up a few minutes after nine he felt terrible he was late for an appointment hello big boy tammy said you were wonderful avery tried to remember something about last night he failed was i he said yeah the best she said he began to believe her listen he said i have to take a shower and then go to work shall we meet tonight at the bar ill be there lover she said he went off to the shower she slid across the bed to the phone and called abby hes in the shower are you ok yeah he couldnt do it if he had to does he suspect anything i dont think so hes in pain how long will you be about ten or fifteen minutes ok hurry they put their phones down under the roof a recorder witched itself off and was ready for the next phone call chapter seventeen tarry ross while avery was at work the two women finished the last two cupboards of files they had a mountain of photocopied pieces of paper by twothirty in the afternoon it was all in boxes in a storage room in georgetown over the next few days tammy flew in and out of the caymans and carried the papers to a oneroom apartment in brentwood near nashville there she started the long job of listing and describing all the contents mitch had told her it was urgent tarrance was surprised when abby came to the meeting instead of mitch but she was no less efficient she gave him the instructions for wiring the first million dollars to a bank in freeport in the bahamas and when do we get the files tarrance asked as soon as we hear the moneys in freeport well send you a key to a storage room somewhere in memphis any questions yes are you making progress in getting the dirty files she smiled we already have most of what we need by the time we finish well have ten thousand dirty files for you tarrance was excited where are they not with the clean files i promise you but you have them yes would you like to see a couple of course you can as soon as ray is out of prison tarry ross was known to the palumbo family as alfred the fewer people who knew his real name the better then his employers the fbi would never hear about his profitable extra work the palumbo family decided to help the morolto family lazarov told them he wanted some information out of the fbi the palumbos said they would do it for half a million lazarov agreed and vinnie cozzo from the palumbo family met ross make it quick cozzo ross said nervously did you ever hear of the bendini firm in memphis cozzo asked no the rule was always to say no at first and always make them wait that way the price went up of course hed heard of bendini lambert locke vinnie went on theres someone down there named mitchell mcdeere who works for this bendini firm we want to know if hes been talking to your people we think hes selling information to the fbi we just want to know if were right you know thats all ross listened with a straight face though it wasnt easy he knew everything about mcdeere he knew that mcdeere had met tarrance half a dozen times now he knew that tomorrow mcdeere was suddenly going to get a million dollars ill see what i can do he said how much two hundred thousand in cash ross said in amazement yeah you can see were real serious about this can you do it yes when give me two weeks chapter eighteen fitting the pieces together in the weeks before the end of the tax year everyone in the firm was especially busy with no wife to go home to mitch worked later than anyone else besides he had extra work to do one night at three in the morning he unlocked averys office on the fourth floor with one of the keys abby had given him he remembered a lot of the names of the files on tammys list he unlocked the file cupboards and found what he was looking for he carried the papers over to the photocopier near averys office every file in the firm had a number and none of the copiers in the building would start until they were programmed with a file number mitch programmed the machine with the number of an innocent file which was sitting on his desk downstairs and copied all pieces of paper he returned this file to averys office and came back with another one he programmed in a different number that night he used eighteen file numbers from his own files and three he borrowed from lamar quins files a wire led from the copier through a hole in the wall and down the inside of a cupboard where it joined wires from three other copiers on the fourth floor this new larger wire ran down to the third floor where a computer recorded every copy made within the firm so that they could bill the proper client an innocentlooking grey wire ran from this computer up through the fourth floor to the fifth where another computer recorded the same information and added the details of which machine was used to make the copies devasher was trying to fit the pieces together something was wrong but he couldnt work out what it was he voiced his thoughts to lambert and locke his wife leaves saying her mothers got to have an operation and that shes tired of him right but from the conversations weve recorded things werent that bad between them and why cant we find a hospital thats heard of maxine sutherland weve checked every hospital in kentucky indiana and tennessee doesnt that seem odd to you not really lambert said people often use hospitals on the other side of the country if thats where the specialist doctor is and her parents are rich people theyd find the best medical help wherever it was locke nodded and agreed how much has he talked to her she calls about once a day all they talk about is her mother and his work and stuff like that hasnt she mentioned the name of the hospital asked locke not once sometimes i think its a trick to get her out of town to protect her i cant believe that lambert said theres no proof of that devasher looked angrily at them and walked nervously up and down behind his desk about ten days ago someone made a lot of unusual copies on the fourth floor at three oclock in the morning at the time only mcdeere and scott kimble were in the building neither of them has any business on the fourth floor twentyone file numbers were used three belong to lamar quins files and the other eighteen all belong to mcdeeres files none belong to kimble the copier used was the one nearest to averys office and mcdeere works closely with avery who do you think made the copies how many just over two thousand which files his own tax clients at this time of year that seems fine doesnt it but five days later his secretary used the same eighteen file numbers to make three hundred copies it seems to me that three hundred copies is what youd expect for tax clients at this time of year but two thousand locke and lambert were listening closely now so what was he copying devasher continued i dont know but averys got cupboards in his office where the real files are kept he couldnt copy those files lambert said what else was he copying ollie if he and tarrance are talking what else would he want from averys office how could he get averys keys locke asked thats the question isnt it devasher said avery says he keeps them with him all the time he also says that when he was on the caymans three weeks ago he slept alone both nights but hes lying listen to this he played them the recorded phone conversation between tammy and abby who are those women locke demanded we dont know the one in his house must be someone he brought home from a bar but why is she calling a friend its too much to think that these women took his keys and managed to copy them in the middle of the night without his knowing anything about it and that they are friends of mcdeeres i agree said lambert what about all the secret files in the beach house asked locke ive thought about that nat lets say she had the keys though thats unlikely and lets say she opened the room and found the files whats she going to do with them in the middle of the night with avery asleep upstairs she could read them i dont think so there are too many of them she could be working for the fbi no definitely not devasher said shes no professional no professional would make a phone call like that i can only think that she and her friend were after his wallet and something went wrong locke and lambert agreed but weve got to be safe devasher said i want all the locks changed on the third and fourth floors and in the beach house i want everyone on grand cayman who can copy keys questioned and averys a risk i want him to leave for a while pretend hes ill or something and has to take time off work on saturday mitch went to visit ray in prison by talking in spanish and when the guards were nowhere near them mitch warned him to be ready to escape in a few days time when he got back to memphis he parked his bmw in the centre of town the fairhaired man with a moustache whose name was aaron rimmer called devasher hes only gone shopping he said ill stay with the car until he comes back for it mitch walked into a shop and used a pay phone to call for a taxi to meet him at the side entrance in ten minutes the taxi took him to the apartment at brentwood he knocked on the door who is it a nervous female voice asked from inside he heard the voice and felt weak barry abanks he said abby opened the door and rushed into his arms after an hour on the bed the pain of loneliness was forgotten they walked through the small apartment holding hands and kissing mitch saw for the first time the enormous amounts of paper he had seen tammys notes and lists but not the actual papers one day soon he would spend hours here studying the papers and preparing his evidence chapter nineteen averys illness on monday morning mitchs secretary told him that lambert wanted to see him but dont forget that youre due at mulhollands office in the cotton shipping building soon she added up in lamberts

tomorrow next day the hunt got closer the police were looking for a man who had attacked a woman in the perdido beach hilton when ray mcdeeres picture appeared in the papers as an escaped murderer the hotel clerk connected him with the attack and told the police that he was with a woman called rachel james the victim of the attack karen adair supported by her boyfriend aaron rimmer agreed that the criminal was ray mcdeere then the clerk remembered that rachel james was driving a white cutlass the police began to search for the car it took seventeen trips from the apartment to the van with all the boxes then mitch sat in the apartment and wrote down instructions for tammy he also told her that there was a million dollars waiting for her in her bank he spoke to abby at the holiday hotel in panama city beach she told him about the police hunt for ray which was in all the newspapers wheres ray now on the beach trying to brown his face ive told him everything hes also had a haircut good idea abby you must cut your hair and color it blonde but first you must get out of there just walk out make it look as if youre going for a walk on the beach but a mile east along the beach is a small hotel called the blue tide sign in there as jackie nagel ill be there soon dont worry there are so many hotels and buildings along the beach there that itll take them a year to search them all twelve hours later the three of them were together chapter twenty three panama city beach joey morolto flew down with forty of his men he settled himself in the sandpiper hotel the first thing he did was get all the available partners and associates from memphis to come to alabama these people knew mcdeere they could recognize him three miles along the beach f denton voyles and tarrance were sitting in their hotel waiting for news they had sixty fbi agents and hundreds of local cops searching for the car the white cutlass was found at nine in the morning in the car park of an apartment building in panama city beach voyles immediately moved all his men down there a local cop phoned that nice mr rimmer to tell him the news so that he and his pretty girlfriend would feel better mr rimmer called lazarov at the sandpiper rimmer and lazarov immediately moved all their men down to panama city beach it took only a few minutes for the van to become hot news the man who had rented it to mitch was reading his morning paper and he remembered the name mcdeere he looked through his records and phoned the police a short while later voyles and tarrance got the news they realized that the van must be for carrying the files at nine mitch called tammy she had the new documents and passports mitch told her to send them to sam fortune at the blue tide hotel and gave her the address he told her to make sure they arrived the next day finally he told her to leave nashville drive to knoxville and call him from there by midday all the roads to the coast around panama city beach were closed by the police lazarov and morolto were in the best western hotel while their men were out searching at four in the afternoon a clerk in the holiday hotel told the police that abby mcdeere was probably the woman who had paid cash for two rooms for three nights but hadnt really used either of them at a police car stopped in the car park of a cheap hotel and found the van mitch had rented it was empty andy patrick had first gone to prison for four months when he was nineteen since then he had committed plenty of minor crimes he hated violence he hated cops a cop had once beaten him so badly that he lost one eye six months ago he found himself in panama city beach and got a job as a clerk at the blue tide hotel around nine on friday night he was watching tv when the cop walked in were looking for some people said the cop and laid pictures on the counter seen any of them andy studied the pictures he thought he recognized the one of mitchell y mcdeere his criminals mind began to work i havent seen them he said ill tell you if i do theyre dangerous said the cop youre the dangerous one andy thought as soon as the cop had left andy went and knocked on the door of room he could see the red lights of police cars passing on the road behind the hotel whos there a womans voice said the manager andy replied mitch opened the door andy could see he was nervous what is it he asked the police were just here andy explained they showed me some pictures i said i couldnt recognize them do you know what i mean they said one of these people had been in prison ive been in prison too and i think everyone should escape am i making myself clear yes mitch said whats your name andy andy ill give you a thousand dollars now and another thousand tomorrow if youre still unable to recognize any of the faces in the pictures five thousand a day andy said ok and ill give you another five thousand to bring me a small packet that will arrive tomorrow morning good andy went back to his counter back in the room mitch said i think our luck has just changed for the better chapter twenty four on the floor among the boxes why here lazarov asked why did they choose panama city beach theyre trapped here the cops have got the whole place covered there are only about sixty of our men and the cops have got hundreds so the chances are that theyll find them before we do morolto nodded so weve got to improve our chances leave that to me devasher said but why here its good for them that there are a lot of small hotels but we can still send our people to search them room by room itll take time but we can do it the water morolto suddenly shouted theyre going to try to escape by sea in the dark that makes sense to me devasher said so where are our boats morolto said lazarov jumped from his seat and began shouting orders down the phone he wanted his men to hire every available boat and stay out at sea waiting devasher gave his own orders to rimmer and his men rimmer drove up to tallahassee and phoned the police from there listen he said excitedly i just saw those three people youre after theyre driving a green ford van theyre going south five minutes later fat tony verkler did exactly the same from a few miles further south within a couple of hours nearly all the local cops had returned to their stations and all the fbi agents were travelling south mitch abby and ray watched the news on tv now that the police search had moved away from panama city beach it was more dangerous for them the police only wanted to arrest them moroltos men wanted to kill them early the next morning mitch sat back down on the floor among all the boxes he nodded at abby who was operating the camera he continued giving evidence after sixteen hours he had nearly finished with the help of tammys lists he told the court where they could find nine hundred million dollars of mafia money in banks he then explained how the whole system worked and who the most important figures were for six hours he explained the various methods the moroltos and their lawyers used to turn dirty money into clean he knew that the evidence was incomplete but when the fbi had these films they could easily get permission to search the whole bendini building and all its computer records at andy patrick received the envelope addressed to sam fortune he started to take it over to room but stopped when he saw two men knocking at the doors to the rooms he went back to the reception desk and phoned room mr fortune i think you should know there are two men coming your way theyre knocking on all the doors are they cops i dont think so they didnt come and see me first thanks well switch the lights off and not answer the door theyll think the rooms empty what about the packet its here ok can you bring it over as soon as its safe yeah in room they admired the new documents and passports the doctor certainly knew his work we have to celebrate ray said besides im going crazy in here im going to get us some beers ray no mitch said theres no need to take chances but ray wasnt listening he stayed close to the walls until he reached the end of the hotel there was a row of shops next to the hotel he waited until he was sure no one was looking and then went into the supermarket in the car park in front of the shops lamar quin saw ray enter the shop the way the man moved was familiar he walked over to the shop and went inside he took a coke and waited to pay for it until he came face to face with the man it wasnt mitch mcdeere but he looked just like him it was ray it had to be the face was darker than his prison photograph and he was wearing sunglasses but this was definitely a mcdeere hows it going lamar said to the man fine you even the voice was similar lamar paid for his drink and returned to the car park he calmly put the coke in his car then he went to the next shop to continue his search for the mcdeeres chapter twenty five the pier the dan russell pier was the one which was furthest west of the three piers on panama city beach it was about half a mile east of the blue tide at eleventhirty abby left room and began walking east along the beach five minutes later mitch left while abby was dressed to look like a tourist mitch was dressed all in black so was ray who left five minutes after mitch locking the door behind him at midnight abby stood at the end of the pier mitch sat on a chair at the beach end of the pier ray was standing on the sand about fifty yards away abby hid as much of her torch as possible in her coat and pointed it out to sea she switched it on and off on and off there was no reply she tried again again there was no reply from the corner of his eye mitch saw someone jump on to the pier and walk quickly towards abby it was rimmer mitch was up and running silently after him rimmer walked up behind abby and called her name she turned round and started to scream rimmer jumped at her and at the same time mitch dived head first into his legs all three fell down on to the hard surface of the pier rimmer hit mitch hard in the eye and reached for his gun he never found it ray charged into him and hit him again and again until he was unconscious switch on the torch again abby ray said as he unwrapped the rope from his waist she turned out to sea and did as he said what are you going to do mitch whispered watching ray and the rope we can either shoot him or drown him ray said we have to do one or the other oh my god said abby dont fire the gun mitch whispered i agree ray said he twisted the rope around rimmers neck and tightened it rimmer didnt move after three minutes ray slid the body at the end of the rope down into the water abanks was late but he found a way through the small boats which were waiting out at sea none of moroltos men even saw him come and none of them saw him go with his three new passengers at six in the morning tammy phoned tarrance just as mitch had said she should you can have the files now wayne she said theyre in room blue tide hotel panama city beach the clerk is called andy and hell let you into the room be careful with the files wayne weve taken a lot of time and trouble getting them all neat for you and youll find sixteen hours of film there too i have just one question tarrance said tiredly where is he by now said tammy theyre on a plane to south america ive got to go goodbye the boat abanks had bought them was perfect with it and the money they could spend the rest of their lives sailing in luxury among the thousands of islands in the west indies they could have homes on two or three of the smaller ones like little cayman where no one ever came abanks taught them all he knew about boating and about the islands they knew from newspapers that the firm and the morolto family were finished fiftyone present and past members of the firm were arrested and the morolto family trials would go on for years the memphis newspapers listed the names of all the arrested lawyers as mitch read their names he saw their faces he almost felt sorry for some of them and he pitied their wives and children what a waste of talent i love you mitch abby was standing behind him well be ok as long as were together we can handle anything i never really wanted to be a lawyer anyway mitch said i always wanted to be a sailor the end
