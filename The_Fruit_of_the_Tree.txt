the fruit of the tree book i the fruit of the tree i in the surgical ward of the hope hospital at hanaford a nurse was bending over a young man whose bandaged right hand and arm lay stretched along the bed his head stirred uneasily and slipping her arm behind him she effected a professional readjustment of the pillows is that better as she leaned over he lifted his anxious bewildered eyes deepsunk under ridges of suffering i dont spose theres any kind of a show for me is there he asked pointing with his free hand the stained seamed hand of the mechanic to the inert bundle on the quilt her only immediate answer was to wipe the dampness from his forehead then she said well talk about that tomorrow why not now because dr disbrow cant tell till the inflammation goes down will it go down by tomorrow it will begin to if you dont excite yourself and keep up the fever excite myself i theres four of em at home well then there are four reasons for keeping quiet she rejoined she did not use in speaking the soothing inflection of her trade she seemed to disdain to cajole or trick the sufferer her full young voice kept its cool note of authority her sympathy revealing itself only in the expert touch of her hands and the constant vigilance of her dark steady eyes this vigilance softened to pity as the patient turned his head away with a groan his free left hand continued to travel the sheet clasping and unclasping itself in contortions of feverish unrest it was as though all the anguish of his mutilation found expression in that lonely hand left without work in the world now that its mate was useless the nurse felt a touch on her shoulder and rose to face the matron a sharpfeatured woman with a soft intonation this is mr amherst miss brent the assistant manager from the mills he wishes to see dillon john amhersts step was singularly noiseless the nurse sensitive by nature and training to all physical characteristics was struck at once by the contrast between his alert face and figure and the silent way in which he moved she noticed too that the same contrast was repeated in the face itself its spare energetic outline with the high nose and compressed lips of the mover of men being curiously modified by the veiled inward gaze of the grey eyes he turned on her it was one of the interests of justine brents crowded yet lonely life to attempt a rapid mental classification of the persons she met but the contradictions in amhersts face baffled her and she murmured inwardly i dont know as she drew aside to let him approach the bed he stood by her in silence his hands clasped behind him his eyes on the injured man who lay motionless as if sunk in a lethargy the matron at the call of another nurse had minced away down the ward committing amherst with a glance to miss brent and the two remained alone by the bed after a pause amherst moved toward the window beyond the empty cot adjoining dillons one of the white screens used to isolate dying patients had been placed against this cot which was the last at that end of the ward and the space beyond formed a secluded corner where a few words could be exchanged out of reach of the eyes in the other beds is he asleep amherst asked as miss brent joined him miss brent glanced at him again his voice betokened not merely education but something different and deeper the familiar habit of gentle speech and his shabby clothes carefully brushed but illcut and worn along the seams sat on him easily and with the same difference the morphine has made him drowsy she answered the wounds were dressed about an hour ago and the doctor gave him a hypodermic the wounds how many are there besides the hand his arm is badly torn up to the elbow amherst listened with bent head and frowning brow what do you think of the case she hesitated dr disbrow hasnt said and its not your business to he smiled slightly i know hospital etiquette but i have a particular reason for asking he broke off and looked at her again his veiled gaze sharpening to a glance of concentrated attention youre not one of the regular nurses are you your dress seems to be of a different colour she smiled at the seems to be which denoted a tardy and imperfect apprehension of the difference between darkblue linen and white no i happened to be staying at hanaford and hearing that they were in want of a surgical nurse i offered my help amherst nodded so much the better is there any place where i can say two words to you i could hardly leave the ward now unless mrs ogan comes back i dont care to have you call mrs ogan he interposed quickly when do you go off duty she looked at him in surprise if what you want to ask about is anything connected with the management of things here you know were not supposed to talk of our patients outside of the hospital i know but i am going to ask you to break through the rule in that poor fellows behalf a protest wavered on her lip but he held her eyes steadily with a glint of goodhumour behind his determination when do you go off duty at six ill wait at the corner of south street and walk a little way with you let me put my case and if youre not convinced you can refuse to answer very well she said without farther hesitation and amherst with a slight nod of farewell passed through the door near which they had been standing ii when justine brent emerged from the hope hospital the october dusk had fallen and the wide suburban street was almost dark except when the illuminated bulk of an electric car flashed by under the maples she crossed the tracks and approached the narrower thoroughfare where amherst awaited her he hung back a moment and she was amused to see that he failed to identify the uniformed nurse with the girl in her trim dark dress soberly complete in all its accessories who advanced to him smiling under her little veil thank you he said as he turned and walked beside her is this your way i am staying in oak street but its just as short to go by maplewood avenue yes and quieter for a few yards they walked on in silence their long steps falling naturally into time though amherst was somewhat taller than his companion at length he said i suppose you know nothing about the relation between hope hospital and the westmore mills only that the hospital was endowed by one of the westmore family yes an old miss hope a greataunt of westmores but there is more than that between them all kinds of subterranean passages he paused and began again for instance dr disbrow married the sister of our managers wife your chief at the mills yes he said with a slight grimace so you see if truscomb the manager thinks one of the millhands is only slightly injured its natural that his brotherinlaw dr disbrow should take an optimistic view of the case natural i dont know dont you think its natural that a man should be influenced by his wife not where his professional honour is concerned amherst smiled that sounds very young if youll excuse my saying so well i wont go on to insinuate that truscomb being high in favour with the westmores and the westmores having a lien on the hospital disbrows position there is also bound up with his taking more or less the same view as truscombs miss brent had paused abruptly on the deserted pavement no dont go on if you want me to think well of you she flashed out amherst met the thrust composedly perceiving as she turned to face him that what she resented was not so much his insinuation against his superiors as his allusion to the youthfulness of her sentiments she was in fact as he now noticed still young enough to dislike being excused for her youth in her severe uniform of blue linen her dusky skin darkened by the nurses cap and by the pale background of the hospital walls she had seemed older more competent and experienced but he now saw how fresh was the pale curve of her cheek and how smooth the brow clasped in close waves of hair i began at the wrong end he acknowledged but let me put dillons case before you dismiss me she softened it is only because of my interest in that poor fellow that i am here because you think he needs help and that you can help him but she held back once more please tell me about him first she said walking on amherst met the request with another question i wonder how much you know about factory life oh next to nothing just what ive managed to pick up in these two days at the hospital he glanced at her small determined profile under its dark roll of hair and said half to himself that might be a good deal she took no notice of this and he went on well i wont try to put the general situation before you though dillons accident is really the result of it he works in the carding room and on the day of the accident his card stopped suddenly and he put his hand behind him to get a tool he needed out of his trouserpocket he reached back a little too far and the card behind him caught his hand in its million of diamondpointed wires truscomb and the overseer of the room maintain that the accident was due to his own carelessness but the hands say that it was caused by the fact of the cards being too near together and that just such an accident was bound to happen sooner or later miss brent drew an eager breath and what do you say that theyre right the cardingroom is shamefully overcrowded dillon hasnt been in it long he worked his way up at the mills from being a bobbinboy and he hadnt yet learned how cautious a man must be in there the cards are so close to each other that even the old hands run narrow risks and it takes the cleverest operative some time to learn that he must calculate every movement to a fraction of an inch but why do they crowd the rooms in that way to get the maximum of profit out of the minimum of floorspace it costs more to increase the floorspace than to maim an operative now and then i see go on she murmured thats the first point here is the second dr disbrow told truscomb this morning that dillons hand would certainly be saved and that he might get back to work in a couple of months if the company would present him with an artificial finger or two miss brent faced him with a flush of indignation mr amherst who gave you this version of dr disbrows report the manager himself verbally no he showed me disbrows letter for a moment or two they walked on silently through the quiet street then she said in a voice still stirred with feeling as i told you this afternoon dr disbrow has said nothing in my hearing and mrs ogan oh mrs ogan her voice broke in a ripple of irony mrs ogan feels it to be such a beautiful dispensation my dear that owing to a death that very morning in the surgical ward we happened to have a bed ready for the poor man within three hours of the accident she had exchanged her deep throattones for a high reedy note which perfectly simulated the matrons ladylike inflections amherst at the change turned on her with a boyish burst of laughter she joined in it and for a moment they were blent in that closest of unions the discovery of a common fund of humour she was the first to grow grave that three hours delay didnt help matters how is it there is no emergency hospital at the mills amherst laughed again but in a different key thats part of the larger question which we havent time for now he waited a moment and then added youve not yet given me your own impression of dillons case you shall have it if you saw that letter dillon will certainly lose his hand and probably the whole arm she spoke with a thrilling of her slight frame that transformed the dispassionate professional into a girl shaken with indignant pity amherst stood still before her good god never anything but useless lumber never and he wont die alas he has a consumptive wife and three children she ruined her health swallowing cottondust at the factory amherst continued so she told me yesterday he turned in surprise youve had a talk with her i went out to westmore last night i was haunted by her face when she came to the hospital she looks forty but she told me she was only twentysix miss brent paused to steady her voice its the curse of my trade that its always tempting me to interfere in cases where i can do no possible good the fact is im not fit to be a nurse i shall live and die a wretched sentimentalist she ended with an angry dash at the tears on her veil her companion walked on in silence till she had regained her composure then he said what did you think of westmore i think its one of the worst places i ever saw and i am not unused to slums it looks so dead the slums of big cities are much more cheerful he made no answer and after a moment she asked does the cottondust always affect the lungs its likely to where there is the least phthisical tendency but of course the harm could be immensely reduced by taking up the old rough floors which hold the dust and by thorough cleanliness and ventilation what does the company do in such cases where an operative breaks down at twentyfive the company says there was a phthisical tendency and will they give nothing in return for the two lives they have taken they will probably pay for dillons care at the hospital and they have taken the wife back as a scrubber to clean those uncleanable floors shes not fit for it she must work fit for it or not and there is less strain in scrubbing than in bending over the looms or cards the pay is lower of course but shes very grateful for being taken back at all now that shes no longer a firstclass worker miss brents face glowed with a fine wrath she cant possibly stand more than two or three months of it without breaking down well you see theyve told her that in less than that time her husband will be at work again and what will the company do for them when the wife is a hopeless invalid and the husband a cripple amherst again uttered the dry laugh with which he had met her suggestion of an emergency hospital i know what i should do if i could get anywhere near dillon give him an overdose of morphine and let the widow collect his lifeinsurance and make a fresh start she looked at him curiously should you i wonder if i saw the suffering as you see it and knew the circumstances as i know them i believe i should feel justified he broke off in your work dont you ever feel tempted to set a poor devil free she mused one mightbut perhaps the professional instinct to save would always come first to save what when all the good of life is gone i daresay she sighed poor dillon would do it himself if he could when he realizes that all the good is gone yes but he cant do it himself and its the irony of such cases that his employers after ruining his life will do all they can to patch up the ruins but that at least ought to count in their favour perhaps if he paused as though reluctant to lay himself open once more to the charge of uncharitableness and suddenly she exclaimed looking about her i didnt notice we had walked so far down maplewood avenue they had turned a few minutes previously into the wide thoroughfare crowning the high ground which is covered by the residential quarter of hanaford here the spacious houses withdrawn behind shrubberies and lawns revealed in their silhouettes every form of architectural experiment from the symmetrical prerevolutionary structure with its classic portico and clipped boxborders to the latest outbreak in boulders and moorish tiles amherst followed his companions glance with surprise we have gone a block or two out of our way i always forget where i am when im talking about anything that interests me miss brent looked at her watch my friends dont dine till seven and i can get home in time by taking a grove street car she said if you dont mind walking a little farther you can take a liberty street car instead they run oftener and you will get home just as soon she made a gesture of assent and as they walked on he continued i havent yet explained why i am so anxious to get an unbiassed opinion of dillons case she looked at him in surprise what youve told me about dr disbrow and your manager is surely enough well hardly considering that i am truscombs subordinate i shouldnt have committed a breach of professional etiquette or asked you to do so if i hadnt a hope of bettering things but i have and that is why ive held on at westmore for the last few months instead of getting out of it altogether im glad of that she said quickly the owner of the mills young richard westmore died last winter he went on and my hope its no more is that the new broom may sweep a little cleaner who is the new broom westmore left everything to his widow and she is coming here tomorrow to look into the management of the mills coming she doesnt live here then at hanaford heaven forbid its an anomaly nowadays for the employer to live near the employed the westmores have always lived in new york and i believe they have a big place on long island well at any rate she is coming and that ought to be a good sign did she never show any interest in the mills during her husbands life not as far as i know ive been at westmore three years and shes not been seen there in my time she is very young and westmore himself didnt care it was a case of inherited money he drew the dividends and truscomb did the rest miss brent reflected i dont know much about the constitution of companies but i suppose mrs westmore doesnt unite all the offices in her own person is there no one to stand between truscomb and the operatives oh the company on paper shows the usual official hierarchy richard westmore of course was president and since his death the former treasurer halford gaines has replaced him and his son westmore gaines has been appointed treasurer you can see by the names that its all in the family halford gaines married a miss westmore and represents the clan at hanaford leads society and keeps up the social credit of the name as treasurer mr halford gaines kept strictly to his special business and always refused to interfere between truscomb and the operatives as president he will probably follow the same policy the more so as it fits in with his inherited respect for the status quo and his blissful ignorance of economics and the new treasurer young gaines is there no hope of his breaking away from the family tradition westy gaines has a better head than his father but he hates hanaford and the mills and his chief object in life is to be taken for a new yorker so far he hasnt been here much except for the quarterly meetings and his routine work is done by another cousin you perceive that westmore is a nest of nepotism miss brents work among the poor had developed her interest in social problems and she followed these details attentively well the outlook is not encouraging but perhaps mrs westmores coming will make a change i suppose she has more power than any one she might have if she chose to exert it for her husband was really the whole company the official cousins hold only a few shares apiece perhaps then her visit will open her eyes who knows but poor dillons case may help others prove a beautiful dispensation as mrs ogan would say it does come terribly pat as an illustration of some of the abuses i want to have remedied the difficulty will be to get the ladys ear thats her house were coming to by the way an electric streetlamp irradiated the leafless trees and stone gateposts of the building before them though gardens extended behind it the house stood so near the pavement that only two short flights of steps intervened between the gateposts and the portico light shone from every window of the pompous rusticated faр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р

two carriages at the door the lamplight showed every detail of dress and countenance in the party which consisted of two men one slightly lame with a long white moustache and a distinguished nose the other short lean and professional and of two ladies and their laden attendants why that must be her party arriving miss brent exclaimed and as she spoke the younger of the two ladies turning back to her maid exposed to the glare of the electric light a fair pale face shadowed by the projection of her widows veil is that mrs westmore miss brent whispered and as amherst muttered i suppose so ive never seen her she continued excitedly she looks so like do you know what her name was before she married he drew his brows together in a hopeless effort of remembrance i dont know i must have heard but i never can recall peoples names thats bad for a leader of men she said mockingly and he answered as though touched on a sore point i mean people who dont count i never forget an operatives name or face one can never tell who may be going to count she rejoined sententiously he dwelt on this in silence while they walked on catching as they passed a glimpse of the redcarpeted westmore hall on which the glass doors were just being closed at length he roused himself to ask does mrs westmore look like some one you know i fancied so a girl who was at the sacred heart in paris with me but isnt this my corner she exclaimed as they turned into another street down which a laden car was descending its approach left them time for no more than a hurried handclasp and when miss brent had been absorbed into the packed interior her companion as his habit was stood for a while where she had left him gazing at some indefinite point in space then waking to a sudden consciousness of his surroundings he walked off toward the centre of the town at the junction of two business streets he met an empty car marked westmore and springing into it seated himself in a corner and drew out a pocket shakespeare he read on indifferent to his surroundings till the car left the asphalt streets and illuminated shopfronts for a grey intermediate region of mud and macadam then he pocketed his volume and sat looking out into the gloom the houses grew less frequent with darker gaps of night between and the rare streetlamps shone on cracked pavements crooked telegraphpoles hoardings tapestried with patentmedicine posters and all the mean desolation of an american industrial suburb farther on there came a weedgrown field or two then a row of operatives houses the showy gables of the eldorado roadhouse the only building in westmore on which fresh paint was freely lavished then the company store the machine shops and other outbuildings the vast forbidding bulk of the factories looming above the riverbend and the sudden neatness of the managers turf and privet hedges the scene was so familiar to amherst that he had lost the habit of comparison and his absorption in the moral and material needs of the workers sometimes made him forget the outward setting of their lives but tonight he recalled the nurses comment it looks so dead and the phrase roused him to a fresh perception of the scene with sudden disgust he saw the sordidness of it all the poor monotonous houses the trampled grassbanks the lean dogs prowling in refuseheaps the reflection of a crooked gaslamp in a stagnant loop of the river and he asked himself how it was possible to put any sense of moral beauty into lives bounded forever by the low horizon of the factory there is a fortuitous ugliness that has life and hope in it the ugliness of overcrowded city streets of the rush and drive of packed activities but this outspread meanness of the suburban working colony uncircumscribed by any pressure of surrounding life and sunk into blank acceptance of its isolation its banishment from beauty and variety and surprise seemed to amherst the very negation of hope and life shes right he mused its dead stone dead there isnt a drop of wholesome blood left in it the moosuc river valley in the hollow of which for that rivers sake the westmore mills had been planted lingered in the memory of preindustrial hanaford as the pleasantest suburb of the town here beyond a region of orchards and farmhouses several leading citizens had placed above the riverbank their prim woodcut residences with porticoes and terraced lawns and from the chief of these hopewood brought into the westmore family by the miss hope who had married an earlier westmore the grim millvillage had been carved the pillared residences had after this inevitably fallen to base uses but the old house at hopewood in its wooded grounds remained neglected but intact beyond the first bend of the river deserted as a dwelling but held in anticipation of rising values when the inevitable growth of westmore should increase the demand for small building lots whenever amhersts eyes were refreshed by the hanging foliage above the roofs of westmore he longed to convert the abandoned countryseat into a park and playground for the millhands but he knew that the company counted on the gradual sale of hopewood as a source of profit no the milltown would not grow beautiful as it grew larger rather in obedience to the grim law of industrial prosperity it would soon lose its one lingering grace and spread out in unmitigated ugliness devouring green fields and shaded slopes like some insectplague consuming the land the conditions were familiar enough to amherst and their apparent inevitableness mocked the hopes he had based on mrs westmores arrival where every stone is piled on another through the whole stupid structure of selfishness and egotism how can one be pulled out without making the whole thing topple and whatever theyre blind to they always see that he mused reaching up for the strap of the car he walked a few yards beyond the managers house and turned down a side street lined with scattered cottages approaching one of these by a gravelled path he pushed open the door and entered a sittingroom where a greenshaded lamp shone pleasantly on bookshelves and a crowded writingtable a brisk little woman in black laying down the evening paper as she rose lifted her hands to his tall shoulders well mother he said stooping to her kiss youre late john she smiled back at him not reproachfully but with affection she was a wonderfully compact and active creature with face so young and hair so white that she looked as unreal as a stage mother till a close view revealed the fine lines that experience had drawn about her mouth and eyes the eyes themselves brightly black and glancing had none of the veiled depths of her sons gaze their look was outward on a world which had dealt her hard blows and few favours but in which her interest was still fresh amused and unabated amherst glanced at his watch never mind duplain will be later still i had to go into hanaford and he is replacing me at the office so much the better dear we can have a minute to ourselves sit down and tell me what kept you she picked up her knitting as she spoke having the kind of hands that find repose in ceaseless small activities her son could not remember a time when he had not seen those small hands in motion shaping garments darning rents repairing furniture exploring the inner economy of clocks i make a sort of ragcarpet of the odd minutes she had once explained to a friend who wondered at her turning to her needlework in the moments interval between other tasks amherst threw himself wearily into a chair i was trying to find out something about dillons case he said his mother turned a quick glance toward the door rose to close it and reseated herself well i managed to have a talk with his nurse when she went off duty this evening the nurse i wonder you could get her to speak luckily shes not the regular incumbent but a volunteer who happened to be here on a visit as it was i had some difficulty in making her talk till i told her of disbrows letter mrs amherst lifted her bright glance from the needles hes very bad then hopelessly maimed she shivered and cast down her eyes do you suppose she really knows she struck me as quite competent to judge a volunteer you say here on a visit what is her name he raised his head with a vague look i never thought of asking her mrs amherst laughed how like you did she say with whom she was staying i think she said in oak street but she didnt mention any name mrs amherst wrinkled her brows thoughtfully i wonder if shes not the thin dark girl i saw the other day with mrs harry dressel was she tall and rather handsome i dont know murmured amherst indifferently as a rule he was humorously resigned to his mothers habit of deserting the general for the particular and following some irrelevant thread of association in utter disregard of the main issue but tonight preoccupied with his subject and incapable of conceiving how anyone else could be unaffected by it he resented her indifference as a sign of incurable frivolity how she can live close to such suffering and forget it was his thought then with a movement of selfreproach he remembered that the work flying through her fingers was to take shape as a garment for one of the infant dillons she takes her pity out in action like that quiet nurse who was as cool as a drummajor till she took off her uniform and then his face softened at the recollection of the girls outbreak much as he admired in theory the woman who kept a calm exterior in emergencies he had all a mans desire to know that the springs of feeling lay close to the unruffled surface mrs amherst had risen and crossed over to his chair she leaned on it a moment pushing the tossed brown hair from his forehead john have you considered what you mean to do next he threw back his head to meet her gaze about this dillon case she continued how are all these investigations going to help you their eyes rested on each other for a moment then he said coldly you are afraid i am going to lose my place she flushed like a girl and murmured its not the kind of place i ever wanted to see you in i know it he returned in a gentler tone clasping one of the hands on his chairback i ought to have followed a profession like my grandfather but my fathers blood was too strong in me i should never have been content as anything but a workingman how can you call your father a workingman he had a genius for mechanics and if he had lived he would have been as great in his way as any statesman or lawyer amherst smiled greater to my thinking but he gave me his hardworking hands without the genius to create with them i wish i had inherited more from him or less but i must make the best of what i am rather than try to be somebody else he laid her hand caressingly against his cheek its hard on you mother but you must bear with me i have never complained john but now youve chosen your work its natural that i should want you to stick to it he rose with an impatient gesture never fear i could easily get another job what if truscomb blacklisted you do you forget that scotch overseer who was here when we came and whom truscomb hounded out of the trade i remember him said amherst grimly but i have an idea i am going to do the hounding this time his mother sighed but her reply was cut short by the noisy opening of the outer door amherst seemed to hear the sound with relief theres duplain he said going into the passage but on the threshold he encountered not the young alsatian overseer who boarded with them but a small boy who said breathlessly mr truscomb wants you to come down bimeby this evening to the office no hes sick abed the blood rushed to amhersts face and he had to press his lips close to check an exclamation say ill come as soon as ive had supper he said the boy vanished and amherst turned back to the sittingroom truscombs ill he has sent for me and i saw mrs westmore arriving tonight have supper mother we wont wait for duplain his face still glowed with excitement and his eyes were dark with the concentration of his inward vision oh john john mrs amherst sighed crossing the passage to the kitchen iii at the managers door amherst was met by mrs truscomb a large flushed woman in a soiled wrapper and diamond earrings mr truscombs very sick he ought not to see you the doctor thinks she began dr disbrow at this point emerged from the sittingroom he was a pale man with a beard of mixed greyanddrab and a voice of the same indeterminate quality good evening mr amherst truscomb is pretty poorly on the edge of pneumonia im afraid as he seems anxious to see you i think youd better go up for two minutes not more please he paused and went on with a smile you wont excite him of course nothing unpleasant hes worried himself sick over that wretched dillon mrs truscomb interposed draping her wrapper majestically about an indignant bosom thats it puts too much heart into his work but well have dillon all right before long the physician genially declared mrs truscomb with a reluctant gesture led amherst up the handsomely carpeted stairs to the room where her husband lay a prey to the cares of office she ushered the young man in and withdrew to the next room where he heard her coughing at intervals as if to remind him that he was under observation the manager of the westmore mills was not the type of man that amhersts comments on his superior suggested as he sat propped against the pillows with a brickred flush on his cheekbones he seemed at first glance to belong to the innumerable army of american business men the sallow undersized lacklustre drudges who have never lifted their heads from the ledger even his eye now bright with fever was dull and noncommittal in daily life and perhaps only the ramifications of his wrinkles could have revealed what particular ambitions had seamed his soul good evening amherst im down with a confounded cold im sorry to hear it the young man forced himself to say cant get my breath thats the trouble truscomb paused and gasped ive just heard that mrs westmore is here and i want you to go round tomorrow morning he had to break off once more yes sir said amherst his heart leaping neednt see her ask for her father mr langhope tell him what the doctor says ill be on my legs in a day or two ask em to wait till i can take em over the mills he shot one of his fugitive glances at his assistant and held up a bony hand wait a minute on your way there stop and notify mr gaines he was to meet them here you understand yes sir said amherst and at that moment mrs truscomb appeared on the threshold i must ask you to come now mr amherst she began haughtily but a glance from her husband reduced her to a heaving pink nonentity hold on amherst i hear youve been in to hanaford did you go to the hospital ezra his wife murmured he looked through her yes said amherst truscombs face seemed to grow smaller and dryer he transferred his look from his wife to his assistant all right youll just bear in mind that its disbrows business to report dillons case to mrs westmore youre to confine yourself to my message is that clear perfectly clear goodnight amherst answered as he turned to follow mrs truscomb that same evening four persons were seated under the bronze chandelier in the red satin drawingroom of the westmore mansion one of the four the young lady in widows weeds whose face had arrested miss brents attention that afternoon rose from a massively upholstered sofa and drifted over to the fireplace near which her father sat didnt i tell you it was awful father she sighed leaning despondently against the high carved mantelpiece surmounted by a bronze clock in the form of an obelisk mr langhope who sat smoking with one faultlesslyclad leg crossed on the other and his ebony stick reposing against the arm of his chair raised his clear ironical eyes to her face as an archр в

like to come here and dig there were no lamps in the room and the numerous gasjets of the chandelier shed their lights impartially on ponderously framed canvases of the bay of naples and the hudson in autumn on carrara busts and bronze indians on velvet pedestals all this murmured mr langhope is getting to be as rare as the giant sequoias in another fifty years we shall have collectors fighting for that bay of naples bessy westmore turned from him impatiently when she felt deeply on any subject her fathers flippancy annoyed her you can see maria she said seating herself beside the other lady of the party why i couldnt possibly live here mrs eustace ansell immediately after dinner had bent her slender back above the velvetcovered writingtable where an inkstand of vienna ormolu offered its empty cup to her pen being habitually charged with a voluminous correspondence she had foreseen this contingency and met it by despatching her maid for her own writingcase which was now outspread before her in all its complex neatness but at bessys appeal she wiped her pen and turned a sympathetic gaze on her companion mrs ansells face drew all its charm from its adaptability it was a different face to each speaker now kindling with irony now gently maternal now charged with abstract meditation and few paused to reflect that in each case it was merely the mirror held up to some one elses view of life it needs doing over she admitted following the widows melancholy glance about the room but you are a spoilt child to complain think of having a house of your own to come to instead of having to put up at the hanaford hotel mrs westmores attention was arrested by the first part of the reply doing over why in the world should i do it over no one could expect me to come here now could they mr tredegar she exclaimed transferring her appeal to the fourth member of the party mr tredegar the family lawyer who had deemed it his duty to accompany the widow on her visit of inspection was strolling up and down the room with short pompous steps a cigar between his lips and his arms behind him he cocked his sparrowlike head scanned the offending apartment and terminated his survey by resting his eyes on mrs westmores charming petulant face it all depends he replied axiomatically how large an income you require mr tredegar uttered this remark with the air of one who pronounces on an important point in law his lightest observation seemed a decision handed down from the bench to which he had never ascended he restored the cigar to his lips and sought approval in mrs ansells expressive eye ah thats it bessy youve that to remember the older lady murmured as if struck by the profundity of the remark mrs westmore made an impatient gesture weve always had money enough dick was perfectly satisfied her voice trembled a little on her husbands name and you dont know what the place is like by daylight and the people who come to call of course you neednt see any one now dear mrs ansell reminded her except the halford gaineses i am sure theyre bad enough juliana gaines will say my dear is that the way widows veils are worn in new york this autumn and halford will insist on our going to one of those awful family dinners all madeira and terrapin its too early for terrapin mrs ansell smiled consolingly but bessy had reverted to her argument besides what difference would my coming here make i shall never understand anything about business she declared mr tredegar pondered and once more removed his cigar the necessity has never arisen but now that you find yourself in almost sole control of a large property mr langhope laughed gently apply yourself bessy bring your masterly intellect to bear on the industrial problem mrs ansell restored the innumerable implements to her writingcase and laid her arm with a caressing gesture on mrs westmores shoulder dont tease her shes tired and she misses the baby i shall get a telegram tomorrow morning exclaimed the young mother brightening of course you will cicely has just eaten two boiled eggs and a bowl of porridge and is bearing up wonderfully she drew mrs westmore persuasively to her feet but the widow refused to relinquish her hold on her grievance you all think im extravagant and careless about money she broke out addressing the room in general from the shelter of mrs ansells embrace but i know one thing if i had my way i should begin to economize by selling this horrible house instead of leaving it shut up from one years end to another her father looked up proposals of retrenchment always struck him as businesslike when they did not affect his own expenditure what do you think of that eh tredegar the eminent lawyer drew in his thin lips from the point of view of policy i think unfavourably of it he pronounced bessys face clouded and mrs ansell argued gently really its too late to look so far into the future remember my dear that we are due at the mills tomorrow at ten the reminder that she must rise early had the effect of hastening mrs westmores withdrawal and the two ladies after an exchange of goodnights left the men to their cigars mr langhope was the first to speak bessys as hopelessly vague about business as i am tredegar why the deuce westmore left her everything outright but he was only a heedless boy himself yes the way he allowed things to go its a wonder there was anything to leave this truscomb must be an able fellow devoted to dicks interests ive always understood he makes the mills pay well at any rate and thats not so easy nowadays but on general principles its as well he should see that we mean to look into everything thoroughly of course halford gaines will never be more than a good figurehead but truscomb must be made to understand that mrs westmore intends to interest herself personally in the business oh by all means of course mr langhope assented his light smile stiffening into a yawn at the mere suggestion he rose with an effort supporting himself on his stick i think ill turn in myself theres not a readable book in that godforsaken library and i believe maria ansell has gone off with my volume of loti the next morning when amherst presented himself at the westmore door he had decided to follow his chiefs instructions to the letter and ask for mr langhope only the decision had cost him a struggle for his heart was big with its purpose but though he knew that he must soon place himself in open opposition to truscomb he recognized the prudence of deferring the declaration of war as long as possible on his round of the mills that morning he had paused in the room where mrs dillon knelt beside her mop and pail and had found her to his surprise comparatively reassured and cheerful dr disbrow she told him had been in the previous evening and had told her to take heart about jim and left her enough money to get along for a week and a wonderful new coughmixture that hed put up for her special amherst found it difficult to listen calmly with the nurses words still in his ears and the sight before him of mrs dillons lean shoulderblades travelling painfully up and down with the sweep of the mop i dont suppose that cost truscomb ten dollars he said to himself as the lift lowered him to the factory door but another voice argued that he had no right to accuse disbrow of acting as his brotherinlaws agent when the gift to mrs dillon might have been prompted by his own kindness of heart and what prompted the lie about her husband well perhaps hes an incurable optimist he summed up springing into the hanaford car by the time he reached mrs westmores door his wrath had subsided and he felt that he had himself well in hand he had taken unusual pains with his appearance that morning or rather his mother learning of the errand on which truscomb had sent him had laid out his carefullybrushed sunday clothes and adjusted his tie with skilful fingers youd really be handsome johnny if you were only a little vainer she said pushing him away to survey the result and when he stared at her repeating i never heard that vanity made a man betterlooking she responded gaily oh up to a certain point because it teaches him how to use what hes got so remember she charged him as he smiled and took up his hat that youre going to see a pretty young woman and that youre not a hundred years old yourself ill try to he answered humouring her but as ive been forbidden to ask for her i am afraid your efforts will be wasted the servant to whom he gave his message showed him into the library with a request that he should wait and there to his surprise he found not the whitemoustached gentleman whom he had guessed the night before to be mr langhope but a young lady in deep black who turned on him a look of not unfriendly enquiry it was not bessys habit to anticipate the clock but her distaste for her surroundings and the impatience to have done with the tedious duties awaiting her had sent her downstairs before the rest of the party her life had been so free from tiresome obligations that she had but a small stock of patience to meet them with and already after a night at hanaford she was pining to get back to the comforts of her own countryhouse the soft rut of her daily habits the funny chatter of her little girl the long stride of her irish hunter across the hempstead plains to everything in short that made it conceivably worth while to get up in the morning the servant who ushered in amherst thinking the room empty had not mentioned his name and for a moment he and his hostess examined each other in silence bessy puzzled at the unannounced appearance of a goodlooking young man who might have been some one she had met and forgotten while amherst felt his selfpossession slipping away into the depths of a pair of eyes so darklashed and deeply blue that his only thought was one of wonder at his previous indifference to womens eyes mrs westmore he asked restored to selfcommand by the perception that his longedfor opportunity was at hand and bessy his voice confirming the inference she had drawn from his appearance replied with a smile i am mrs westmore but if you have come to see me i ought to tell you that in a moment i shall be obliged to go out to our mills i have a business appointment with our manager but if she broke off gracefully waiting for him to insert his explanation i have come from the manager i am john amherst your assistant manager he added as the mention of his name apparently conveyed no enlightenment mrs westmores face changed and she let slip a murmur of surprise that would certainly have flattered amhersts mother if she could have heard it but it had an opposite effect on the young man who inwardly accused himself of having tried to disguise his trade by not putting on his everyday clothes how stupid of me i took you for i had no idea i didnt expect mr truscomb here his employer faltered in embarrassment then their eyes met and both smiled mr truscomb sent me to tell you that he is ill and will not be able to show you the mills today i didnt mean to ask for you i was told to give the message to mr langhope amherst scrupulously explained trying to repress the sudden note of joy in his voice he was subject to the unobservant mans acute flashes of vision and mrs westmores beauty was like a blinding light abruptly turned on eyes subdued to obscurity as he spoke his glance passed from her face to her hair and remained caught in its meshes he had never seen such hair it did not seem to grow in the usual orderly way but bubbled up all over her head in independent clusters of brightness breaking about the brow the temples the nape into little irrelevant waves and eddies of light with dusky hollows of softness where the hand might plunge it takes but the throb of a nerve to carry such a complex impression from the eye to the mind but the object of the throb had perhaps felt the electric flash of its passage for her colour rose while amherst spoke ah here is my father now she said with a vague accent of relief as mr langhopes stick was heard tapping its way across the hall when he entered accompanied by mrs ansell his sharp glance of surprise at her visitor told her that he was as much misled as herself and gave her a sense of being agreeably justified in her blunder if father thinks youre a gentleman her shining eyes seemed to say as she explained this is mr amherst father mr truscomb has sent him mr amherst langhope with extended hand echoed affably but vaguely and it became clear that neither mrs westmore nor her father had ever before heard the name of their assistant manager the discovery stung amherst to a somewhat unreasoning resentment and while he was trying to subordinate this sentiment to the larger feelings with which he had entered the house mrs ansell turning her eyes on him said gently your name is unusual i had a friend named lucy warne who married a very clever man a mechanical genius amhersts face cleared my father was a genius and my mother is lucy warne he said won by the soft look and the persuasive voice what a delightful coincidence we were girls together at albany you must remember judge warne she said turning to mr langhope who twirling his white moustache murmured a shade less cordially of course of course delightful most interesting amherst did not notice the difference his perceptions were already enveloped in the caress that emanated from mrs ansells voice and smile and he only asked himself vaguely if it were possible that this graceful woman with her sunny autumnal air could really be his mothers contemporary but the question brought an instant reaction of bitterness poverty is the only thing that makes people old nowadays he reflected painfully conscious of his own share in the hardships his mother had endured and when mrs ansell went on i must go and see her you must let me take her by surprise he said stiffly we live out at the mills a long way from here oh were going there this morning she rejoined unrebuffed by what she probably took for a mere social awkwardness while mrs westmore interposed but maria mr truscomb is ill and has sent mr amherst to say that we are not to come yes so gaines has just telephoned its most unfortunate mr langhope grumbled he too was already beginning to chafe at the uncongenial exile of hanaford and he shared his daughters desire to despatch the tiresome business before them mr tredegar had meanwhile appeared and when amherst had been named to him and had received his olympian nod bessy anxiously imparted her difficulty but how ill is mr truscomb do you think he can take us over the mills tomorrow she appealed to amherst im afraid not i am sure he cant he has a touch of bronchitis this announcement was met by a general outcry in which sympathy for the manager was not the predominating note mrs ansell saved the situation by breathing feelingly poor man and after a decent echo of the phrase and a doubtful glance at her father mrs westmore said if its bronchitis he may be ill for days and what in the world are we to do pack up and come back later suggested mr langhope briskly but while bessy sighed oh that dreadful journey mr tredegar interposed with authority one moment langhope please mr amherst is mrs westmore expected at the mills yes i believe they know she is coming then i think my dear that to go back to new york without showing yourself would under the circumstances be er an error in judgment good lord tredegar you dont expect to keep us kicking our heels here for days her father ejaculated i can certainly not afford to employ mine in that manner for even a fraction of a day rejoined the lawyer always acutely resentful of the suggestion that he had a disengaged moment but meanwhile father bessy interposed with an eagerly flushing cheek dont you see that the only thing for us to do is to go over the mills now at once with mr amherst mr langhope stared he was always adventurously ready to unmake plans but it flustered him to be called on to remake them eh what now at once but gaines was to have gone with us and how on earth are we to get at him he telephoned me that as the visit was given up he should ride out to his farm oh never mind or at least all the better his daughter urged we can see the mills just as well without him and we shall get on so much more quickly well well what do you say tredegar murmured mr langhope allured by her last argument and bessy clasping her hands summed up enthusiastically and i shall understand so much better without a lot of people trying to explain to me at once her sudden enthusiasm surprised no one for even mrs ansell expert as she was in the interpreting of tones set it down to the natural desire to have done as quickly as might be with hanaford mrs westmore has left her little girl at home she said to amherst with a smile intended to counteract the possible illeffect of the impression but amherst suspected no slight in his employers eagerness to visit westmore his overmastering thought was one of joy as the fulness of his opportunity broke on him to show her the mills himself to bring her face to face with her people unhampered by truscombs jealous vigilance and truscombs false explanations to see the angel of pity stir the depths of those unfathomable eyes when they rested perhaps for the first time on suffering that it was in their power to smile away as easily as they had smiled away his own distrust all this the wonderful moment had brought him and thoughts and arguments thronged so hot on his lips that he kept silence fearing lest he should say too much iv john amherst was no onesided idealist he felt keenly the growing complexity of the relation between employer and worker the seeming hopelessness of permanently harmonizing their claims the recurring necessity of fresh compromises and adjustments he hated rant demagogy the rash formulating of emotional theories and his contempt for bad logic and subjective judgments led him to regard with distrust the panaceas offered for the cure of economic evils but his heart ached for the bitter throes with which the human machine moves on he felt the menace of industrial conditions when viewed collectively their poignancy when studied in the individual lives of the toilers among whom his lot was cast and clearly as he saw the need of a philosophic survey of the question he was sure that only through sympathy with its personal human side could a solution be reached the disappearance of the old familiar contact between master and man seemed to him one of the great wrongs of the new industrial situation that the breach must be farther widened by the ultimate substitution of the stockcompany for the individual employer a fact obvious to any student of economic tendencies presented to amhersts mind one of the most painful problems in the scheme of social readjustment but it was characteristic of him to dwell rather on the removal of immediate difficulties than in the contemplation of those to come and while the individual employer was still to be reckoned with the main thing was to bring him closer to his workers till he entered personally into their hardships and aspirations till he learned what they wanted and why they wanted it amherst believed that no mere lawmaking however enlightened could create a wholesome relation between the two this feeling was uppermost as he sat with mrs westmore in the carriage which was carrying them to the mills he had meant to take the trolley back to westmore but at a murmured word from mr tredegar bessy had offered him a seat at her side leaving others to follow this culmination of his hopes the unlookedfor chance of a halfhour alone with her left amherst oppressed with the swiftness of the minutes he had so much to say so much to prepare her for yet how begin while he was in utter ignorance of her character and her point of view and while her lovely nearness left him so little chance of perceiving anything except itself but he was not often the victim of his sensations and presently there emerged out of the very consciousness of her grace and her completeness a clearer sense of the conditions which in a measure had gone to produce them her dress could not have hung in such subtle folds her white chin have nestled in such rich depths of fur the pearls in her ears have given back the light from such pure curves if thin shoulders in shapeless gingham had not bent day in day out above the bobbins and carders and weary ears throbbed even at night with the tumult of the looms amherst however felt no sensational resentment at the contrast he had lived too much with ugliness and want not to believe in human natures abiding need of their opposite he was glad there was room for such beauty in the world and sure that its purpose was an ameliorating one if only it could be used as a beautiful spirit would use it the carriage had turned into one of the nondescript thoroughfares half incipient street half decaying lane which dismally linked the millvillage to hanaford bessy looked out on the ruts the hoardings the starved trees dangling their palsied leaves in the radiant october light then she sighed what a good day for a gallop amherst felt a momentary chill but the naturalness of the exclamation disarmed him and the words called up thrilling memories of his own college days when he had ridden his grandfathers horses in the famous hunting valley not a hundred miles from hanaford bessy met his smile with a glow of understanding you like riding too im sure i used to but i havent been in the saddle for years factory managers dont keep hunters he said laughing her murmur of embarrassment showed that she took this as an apologetic allusion to his reduced condition and in his haste to correct this impression he added if i regretted anything in my other life it would certainly be a gallop on a day like this but i chose my trade deliberately and ive never been sorry for my choice he had hardly spoken when he felt the inappropriateness of this avowal but her prompt response showed him a moment later that it was after all the straightest way to his end you find the work interesting im sure it must be youll think me very ignorant my husband and i came here so seldomi feel as if i ought to know so much more about it she explained at last the note for which he waited had been struck wont you try to now youre here theres so much worth knowing he broke out impetuously mrs westmore coloured but rather with surprise than displeasure im very stupid ive no head for business but i will try to she said its not business that i mean its the personal relation just the thing the business point of view leaves out financially i dont suppose your mills could be better run but there are over seven hundred women working in them and theres so much to be done just for them and their children he caught a faint hint of withdrawal in her tone i have always understood that mr truscomb did everything amherst flushed but he was beyond caring for the personal rebuff do you leave it to your little girls nurses to do everything for her he asked her surprise seemed about to verge on annoyance he saw the preliminary ruffling of the woman who is put to the trouble of defending her dignity really i dont see she began with distant politeness then her face changed and melted and again her blood spoke for her before her lips i am glad you told me that mr amherst of course i want to do whatever i can i should like you to point out everything amhersts resolve had been taken while she spoke he would point out everything would stretch his opportunity to its limit all thoughts of personal prudence were flung to the winds her blush and tone had routed the waiting policy he would declare war on truscomb at once and take the chance of dismissal at least before he went he would have brought this exquisite creature face to face with the wrongs from which her luxuries were drawn and set in motion the regenerating impulses of indignation and pity he did not stop to weigh the permanent advantage of this course his only feeling was that the chance would never again be given him that if he let her go away back to her usual life with eyes unopened and heart untouched there would be no hope of her ever returning it was far better that he should leave for good and that she should come back as come back she must more and more often if once she could be made to feel the crying need of her presence but where was he to begin how give her even a glimpse of the packed and intricate situation mrs westmore he said theres no time to say much now but before we get to the mills i want to ask you a favour if as you go through them you see anything that seems to need explaining will you let me come and tell you about it tonight i say tonight he added meeting her look of enquiry because later tomorrow even i might not have the chance there are some things a good many in the management of the mills that mr truscomb doesnt see as i do i dont mean business questions wages and dividends and so on those are out of my province i speak merely in the line of my own work my care of the hands and what i believe they need and dont get under the present system naturally if mr truscomb were well i shouldnt have had this chance of putting the case to you but since its come my way i must seize it and take the consequences even as he spoke by a swift reaction of thought those consequences rose before him in all their seriousness it was not only or chiefly that he feared to lose his place though he knew his mother had not spoken lightly in instancing the case of the foreman whom truscomb to gratify a personal spite had for months kept out of a job in his trade and there were special reasons why amherst should heed her warning in adopting a manual trade instead of one of the gentlemanly professions which the men of her family had always followed he had not only disappointed her hopes and to a great extent thrown away the benefits of the education she had pinched herself to give him but had disturbed all the habits of her life by removing her from her normal surroundings to the depressing exile of a factorysettlement however much he blamed himself for exacting this sacrifice it had been made so cheerfully that the consciousness of it never clouded his life with his mother but her selfeffacement made him the more alive to his own obligations and having placed her in a difficult situation he had always been careful not to increase its difficulties by any imprudence in his conduct toward his employers yet grave as these considerations were they were really less potent than his personal desire to remain at westmore lightly as he had just resolved to risk the chance of dismissal all his future was bound up in the hope of retaining his place his heart was in the work at westmore and the fear of not being able to get other employment was a small factor in his intense desire to keep his post what he really wanted was to speak out and yet escape the consequences by some miraculous reversal of probability to retain his position and yet effect truscombs removal the idea was so fantastic that he felt it merely as a quickening of all his activities a tremendous pressure of will along undetermined lines he had no wish to take the managers place but his dream was to see truscomb superseded by a man of the new school in sympathy with the awakening social movement a man sufficiently practical to run the mills successfully yet imaginative enough to regard that task as the least of his duties he saw the promise of such a man in louis duplain the overseer who boarded with mrs amherst a young fellow of alsatian extraction a millhand from childhood who had worked at his trade in europe as well as in america and who united with more manual skill and a greater nearness to the workmans standpoint all amhersts enthusiasm for the experiments in social betterment that were making in some of the english and continental factories his strongest wish was to see such a man as duplain in control at westmore before he himself turned to the larger work which he had begun to see before him as the sequel to his factorytraining all these thoughts swept through him in the instants pause before mrs westmore responding to his last appeal said with a graceful eagerness yes you must come tonight i want to hear all you can tell me and if there is anything wrong you must show me how i can make it better ill show her and truscomb shant turn me out for it was the vow he passionately registered as the carriage drew up at the officedoor of the main building how this impossible result was to be achieved he had no farther time to consider for in another moment the rest of the party had entered the factory with them and speech was followed up in the roar of the machinery amhersts zeal for his cause was always quickened by the sight of the mills in action he loved the work itself as much as he hated the conditions under which it was done and he longed to see on the operatives faces something of the ardour that lit up his own when he entered the workrooms it was this passion for machinery that at school had turned him from his books at college had drawn him to the courses least in the line of his destined profession and it always seized on him afresh when he was face to face with the monstrous energies of the mills it was not only the sense of power that thrilled him he felt a beauty in the ordered activity of the whole intricate organism in the rhythm of dancing bobbins and revolving cards the swift continuous outpour of doublers and ribbonlaps the steady ripple of the long plyframes the terrible gnashing play of the looms all these varying subordinate motions gathered up into the throb of the great engines which fed the giants arteries and were in turn ruled by the invisible action of quick thought and obedient hands always produced in amherst a responsive rush of life he knew this sensation was too specialized to affect his companions but he expected mrs westmore to be all the more alive to the other side the dark side of monotonous human toil of the banquet of flesh and blood and brain perpetually served up to the monster whose insatiable jaws the looms so grimly typified truscomb as he had told her was a good manager from the profittaking standpoint since it was profitable to keep the machinery in order he maintained throughout the factory a high standard of mechanical supervision except where one or two favoured overseers for truscomb was given to favoritism shirked the duties of their departments but it was of the essence of truscombs policy and not the least of the qualities which made him a paying manager that he saved money scrupulously where its outlay would not have resulted in larger earnings to keep the floors scrubbed the cottondust swept up the rooms freshly whitewashed and wellventilated far from adding the smallest fraction to the quarterly dividends would have deducted from them the slight cost of this additional labour and truscomb therefore economized on scrubbers sweepers and windowwashers and on all expenses connected with improved ventilation and other hygienic precautions though the whole factory was overcrowded the newest buildings were more carefully planned and had the usual sanitary improvements but the old mills had been left in their original state and even those most recently built were fast lapsing into squalor it was no wonder therefore that workers imprisoned within such walls should reflect their long hours of deadening toil in dull eyes and anр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср

skins and in the dreary lassitude with which they bent to their tasks surely amherst argued mrs westmore must feel this must feel it all the more keenly coming from an atmosphere so different from a life where as he instinctively divined all was in harmony with her own graceful person but a deep disappointment awaited him he was still under the spell of their last moments in the carriage when her face and voice had promised so much when she had seemed so deeply if vaguely stirred by his appeal but as they passed from one resounding room to the other from the dull throb of the cardingroom the groan of the plyframes the long steady pound of the slashers back to the angry shriek of the fierce unappeasable looms the light faded from her eyes and she looked merely bewildered and stunned amherst hardened to the din of the factory could not measure its effect on nerves accustomed to the subdued sounds and spacious stillnesses which are the last refinement of luxury habit had made him unconscious of that malicious multiplication and subdivision of noise that kept every point of consciousness vibrating to a different note so that while one set of nerves was torn as with pincers by the dominant scream of the looms others were thrilled with a separate pain by the ceaseless accompaniment of drumming hissing grating and crashing that shook the great building amherst felt this tumult only as part of the atmosphere of the mills and to ears trained like his own he could make his voice heard without difficulty but his attempts at speech were unintelligible to mrs westmore and her companions and after vainly trying to communicate with him by signs they hurried on as if to escape as quickly as possible from the pursuing whirlwind amherst could not allow for the depressing effect of this enforced silence he did not see that if bessy could have questioned him the currents of sympathy might have remained open between them whereas compelled to walk in silence through interminable ranks of meaningless machines to which the human workers seemed mere automatic appendages she lost all perception of what the scene meant he had forgotten too that the swift apprehension of suffering in others is as much the result of training as the immediate perception of beauty both perceptions may be inborn but if they are not they can be developed only through the discipline of experience that girl in the hospital would have seen it all he reflected as the vision of miss brents small incisive profile rose before him but the next moment he caught the light on mrs westmores hair as she bent above a card and the paler image faded like a late moon in the sunrise meanwhile mrs ansell seeing that the detailed inspection of the buildings was as trying to mr langhopes lameness as to his daughters nerves had proposed to turn back with him and drive to mrs amhersts where he might leave her to call while the others were completing their rounds it was one of mrs ansells gifts to detect the first symptoms of ennui in her companions and produce a remedy as patly as old ladies whisk out a scentbottle or a coughlozenge and mr langhopes look of relief showed the timeliness of her suggestion amherst was too preoccupied to wonder how his mother would take this visit but he welcomed mr langhopes departure hoping that the withdrawal of his ironic smile would leave his daughter open to gentler influences mr tredegar meanwhile was projecting his dry glance over the scene trying to converse by signs with the overseers of the different rooms and pausing now and then to contemplate not so much the workers themselves as the special tasks which engaged them how these spectators of the partys progress were affected by mrs westmores appearance even amherst for all his sympathy with their views could not detect they knew that she was the new owner that a disproportionate amount of the result of their toil would in future pass through her hands spread carpets for her steps and hang a setting of beauty about her eyes but the knowledge seemed to produce no special interest in her personality a change of employer was not likely to make any change in their lot their welfare would probably continue to depend on truscombs favour the men hardly raised their heads as mrs westmore passed the women stared but with curiosity rather than interest and amherst could not tell whether their sullenness reacted on mrs westmore or whether they were unconsciously chilled by her indifference the result was the same the distance between them seemed to increase instead of diminishing and he smiled ironically to think of the form his appeal had taken if you see anything that seems to need explaining why she saw nothing nothing but the greasy floor under her feet the cottondust in her eyes the dizzy incomprehensible whirring of innumerable belts and wheels once out of it all she would make haste to forget the dreary scene without pausing to ask for any explanation of its dreariness in the intensity of his disappointment he sought a pretext to cut short the tour of the buildings that he might remove his eyes from the face he had so vainly watched for any sign of awakening and then as he despaired of it the change came they had entered the principal cardingroom and were halfway down its long central passage when mr tredegar who led the procession paused before one of the cards whats that he asked pointing to a ragged strip of black cloth tied conspicuously to the frame of the card the overseer of the room a florid young man with dissipated eyes who at amhersts signal had attached himself to the party stopped short and turned a furious glance on the surrounding operatives what in hell its the first i seen of it he exclaimed making an ineffectual attempt to snatch the mourning emblem from its place at the same instant the midday whistle boomed through the building and at the signal the machinery stopped and silence fell on the mills the more distant workers at once left their posts to catch up the hats and coats heaped untidily in the corners but those nearer by attracted by the commotion around the card stood spellbound fixing the visitors with a dull stare amherst had reddened to the roots of his hair he knew in a flash what the token signified and the sight stirred his pity but it also jarred on his strong sense of discipline and he turned sternly to the operatives what does this mean there was a short silence then one of the hands a thin bent man with mystic eyes raised his head and spoke we done that for dillon he said amhersts glance swept the crowded faces but dillon was not killed he exclaimed while the overseer drawing out his penknife ripped off the cloth and tossed it contemptuously into a heap of cottonrefuse at his feet might better ha been came from another hand and a deep thats so of corroboration ran through the knot of workers amherst felt a touch on his arm and met mrs westmores eyes what has happened what do they mean she asked in a startled voice there was an accident here two days ago a man got caught in the card behind him and his right hand was badly crushed mr tredegar intervened with his dry note of command how serious is the accident how did it happen he enquired through the mans own carelessness ask the manager the overseer interposed before amherst could answer a deep murmur of dissent ran through the crowd but amherst without noticing the overseers reply said to mr tredegar hes at the hope hospital he will lose his hand and probably the whole arm he had not meant to add this last phrase however strongly his sympathies were aroused it was against his rule at such a time to say anything which might inflame the quick passions of the workers he had meant to make light of the accident and dismiss the operatives with a sharp word of reproof but mrs westmores face was close to his he saw the pity in her eyes and feared if he checked its expression that he might never again have the chance of calling it forth his right arm how terrible but then he will never be able to work again she exclaimed in all the horror of a first confrontation with the inexorable fate of the poor her eyes turned from amherst and rested on the faces pressing about her there were many womens faces among them the faces of fagged middleage and of sallow sedentary girlhood for the first time mrs westmore seemed to feel the bond of blood between herself and these dim creatures of the underworld as amherst watched her the lovely miracle was wrought her pallour gave way to a quick rush of colour her eyes widened like a frightened childs and two tears rose and rolled slowly down her face oh why wasnt i told is he married has he children what does it matter whose fault it was she cried her questions pouring out disconnectedly on a wave of anger and compassion it warnt his fault the cards are too close itll happen again hes got three kids at home broke from the operatives and suddenly a voice exclaimed heres his wife now and the crowd divided to make way for mrs dillon who passing through the farther end of the room had been waylaid and dragged toward the group she hung back shrinking from the murderous machine which she beheld for the first time since her husbands accident then she saw amherst guessed the identity of the lady at his side and flushed up to her haggard forehead mrs dillon had been goodlooking in her earlier youth and sufficient prettiness lingered in her hollowcheeked face to show how much more had been sacrificed to sickness and unwholesome toil oh maam maam it warnt jims fault there aint a steadier man living the cards is too crowded she sobbed out some of the other women began to cry a wave of sympathy ran through the circle and mrs westmore moved forward with an answering exclamation you poor creatureyou poor creature she opened her arms to mrs dillon and the scrubbers sobs were buried on her employers breast i will go to the hospital i will come and see you i will see that everything is done bessy reiterated but why are you here how is it that you have had to leave your children she freed herself to turn a reproachful glance on amherst you dont mean to tell me that at such a time you keep the poor woman at work mrs dillon has not been working here lately amherst answered the manager took her back today at her own request that she might earn something while her husband was in hospital mrs westmores eyes shone indignantly earn something but surely she met a silencing look from mr tredegar who had stepped between mrs dillon and herself my dear child no one doubts none of these good people doubt that you will look into the case and do all you can to alleviate it but let me suggest that this is hardly the place she turned from him with an appealing glance at amherst i think the latter said as their eyes met that you had better let me dismiss the hands they have only an hour at midday she signed her assent and he turned to the operatives and said quietly you have heard mrs westmores promise now take yourselves off and give her a clear way to the stairs they dropped back and mr tredegar drew bessys arm through his but as he began to move away she turned and laid her hand on mrs dillons shoulder you must not stay here you must go back to the children i will make it right with mr truscomb she said in a reassuring whisper then through her tears she smiled a farewell at the lingering knot of operatives and followed her companions to the door in silence they descended the many stairs and crossed the shabby unfenced grassplot between the mills and the managers office it was not till they reached the carriage that mrs westmore spoke but maria is waiting for us we must call for her she said rousing herself and as amherst opened the carriagedoor she added you will show us the way you will drive with us during the drive bessy remained silent as if reabsorbed in the distress of the scene she had just witnessed and amherst found himself automatically answering mr tredegars questions while his own mind had no room for anything but the sense of her tremulous lips and of her eyes enlarged by tears he had been too much engrossed in the momentous issues of her visit to the mills to remember that she had promised to call at his mothers for mrs ansell but now that they were on their way thither he found himself wishing that the visit might have been avoided he was too proud of his mother to feel any doubt of the impression she would produce but what would mrs westmore think of their way of living of the cheap jauntiness of the cottage and the smell of cooking penetrating all its thin partitions duplain too would be coming in for dinner and amherst in spite of his liking for the young overseer became conscious of a rather overbearing freedom in his manner the kind of misplaced ease which the newmade american affects as the readiest sign of equality all these trifles usually nonexistent or supremely indifferent to amherst now assumed a sudden importance behind which he detected the uneasy desire that mrs westmore should not regard him as less of her own class than his connections and his bringingup entitled him to be thought in a flash he saw what he had forfeited by his choice of a calling equal contact with the little circle of people who gave life its crowning grace and facility and the next moment he was blushing at this reversal of his standards and wondering almost contemptuously what could be the nature of the woman whose mere presence could produce such a change but there was no struggling against her influence and as the night before he had looked at westmore with the nurses eyes so he now found himself seeing his house as it must appear to mrs westmore he noticed the shabby yellow paint of the palings the neglected garden of their neighbour the weeks wash flaunting itself indecently through the denuded shrubs about the kitchen porch and as he admitted his companions to the narrow passage he was assailed by the expected whiff of boiled dinner with which the steam of washtubs was intimately mingled duplain was in the passage he had just come out of the kitchen and the fact that he had been washing his hands in the sink was made evident by his rolledback shirtsleeves and by the shiny redness of the knuckles he was running through his stiff black hair hallo john he said in his aggressive voice which rose abruptly at sight of amhersts companions and at the same moment the frowsy maidofallwork crimson from stooping over the kitchen stove thrust her head out to call after him see here mr duplain dont you leave your cravat laying round in my dough v mrs westmore stayed just long enough not to break in too abruptly on the flow of her friends reminiscences and to impress herself on mrs amhersts delighted eyes as an embodiment of tactfulness and grace looking sympathetically about the little room which with its books its casts its photographs of memorable pictures seemed after all a not incongruous setting to her charms so that when she rose to go saying as her hand met amhersts tonight then you must tell me all about those poor dillons he had the sense of having penetrated so far into her intimacy that a new westmore must inevitably result from their next meeting say john the boss is a looker duplain commented across the dinnertable with the slangy grossness he sometimes affected but amherst left it to his mother to look a quiet rebuke feeling himself too aloof from such contacts to resent them he had to rouse himself with an effort to take in the overseers next observation there was another lady at the office this morning duplain went on while the two men lit their cigars in the porch asking after you tried to get me to show her over the mills when i said you were busy asking after me what did she look like well her face was kinder white and small with an awful lot of black hair fitting close to it said she came from hope hospital amherst looked up did you show her over he asked with sudden interest duplain laughed slangily what me and have truscomb get on to it and turn me down howd i know she wasnt a yellow reporter amherst uttered an impatient exclamation i wish to heaven a yellow reporter would go through these mills and show them up in headlines a yard high he regretted not having seen the nurse again he felt sure she would have been interested in the working of the mills and quick to notice the signs of discouragement and illhealth in the workers faces but a moment later his regret was dispelled by the thought of his visit to mrs westmore the afternoon hours dragged slowly by in the office where he was bound to his desk by truscombs continued absence but at length the evening whistle blew the clerks in the outer room caught their hats from the rack duplain presented himself with the days report and the two men were free to walk home two hours later amherst was mounting mrs westmores steps and his hand was on the bell when the door opened and dr disbrow came out the physician drew back as if surprised and slightly disconcerted but his smile promptly effaced all signs of vexation and he held his hand out affably a fine evening mr amherst im glad to say i have been able to bring mrs westmore an excellent report of both patients mr truscomb i mean and poor dillon this mild weather is all in their favour and i hope my brotherinlaw will be about in a day or two he passed on with a nod amherst was once more shown into the library where he had found mrs westmore that morning but on this occasion it was mr tredegar who rose to meet him and curtly waved him to a seat at a respectful distance from his own amherst at once felt a change of atmosphere and it was easy to guess that the lowering of temperature was due to dr disbrows recent visit the thought roused the young mans combative instincts and caused him to say as mr tredegar continued to survey him in silence from the depths of a capacious easychair i understood from mrs westmore that she wished to see me this evening it was the wrong note and he knew it but he had been unable to conceal his sense of the vague current of opposition in the air quite so i believe she asked you to come mr tredegar assented laying his hands together vertically and surveying amherst above the acute angle formed by his parched fingertips as he leaned back small dry dictatorial in the careless finish of his evening dress and pearlstudded shirtfront his appearance put the finishing touch to amhersts irritation he felt the incongruousness of his rough clothes in this atmosphere of afterdinner ease the mud on his walkingboots the clinging cottondust which seemed to have entered into the very pores of the skin and again his annoyance escaped in his voice perhaps i have come too early he began but mr tredegar interposed with glacial amenity no i believe you are exactly on time but mrs westmore is unexpectedly detained the fact is mr and mrs halford gaines are dining with her and she has delegated to me the duty of hearing what you have to say amherst hesitated his impulse was to exclaim there is no duty about it but a moments thought showed the folly of thus throwing up the game with the prospect of truscombs being about again in a day or two it might well be that this was his last chance of reaching mrs westmores ear and he was bound to put his case while he could irrespective of personal feeling but his disappointment was too keen to be denied and after a pause he said could i not speak with mrs westmore later mr tredegars cool survey deepened to a frown the young mans importunity was really out of proportion to what he signified mrs westmore has asked me to replace her he said putting his previous statement more concisely then i am not to see her at all amherst exclaimed and the lawyer replied indifferently i am afraid not as she leaves tomorrow mr tredegar was in his element when refusing a favour not that he was by nature unkind he was indeed capable of a cold beneficence but to deny what it was in his power to accord was the readiest way of proclaiming his authority that power of loosing and binding which made him regard himself as almost consecrated to his office having sacrificed to this principle he felt free to add as a gratuitous concession to politeness you are perhaps not aware that i am mrs westmores lawyer and one of the executors under her husbands will he dropped this negligently as though conscious of the absurdity of presenting his credentials to a subordinate but his manner no longer incensed amherst it merely strengthened his resolve to sink all sense of affront in the supreme effort of obtaining a hearing with that stuffed canary to advise her he reflected theres no hope for her unless i can assert myself now and the unconscious wording of his thought expressed his inward sense that bessy westmore stood in greater need of help than her workpeople still he hesitated hardly knowing how to begin to mr tredegar he was no more than an underling without authority to speak in his superiors absence and the lack of an official warrant which he could have disregarded in appealing to mrs westmore made it hard for him to find a good opening in addressing her representative he saw too from mr tredegars protracted silence that the latter counted on the effect of this embarrassment and was resolved not to minimize it by giving him a lead and this had the effect of increasing his caution he looked up and met the lawyers eye mrs westmore he began asked me to let her know something about the condition of the people at the mills mr tredegar raised his hand excuse me he said i understood from mrs westmore that it was you who asked her permission to call this evening and set forth certain grievances on the part of the operatives amherst reddened i did ask her yes but i dont in any sense represent the operatives i simply wanted to say a word for them mr tredegar folded his hands again and crossed one lean little leg over the other bringing into his line of vision the glossy tip of a patentleather pump which he studied for a moment in silence does mr truscomb know of your intention he then enquired no sir amherst answered energetically glad that he had forced the lawyer out of his passive tactics i am here on my own responsibility and in direct opposition to my own interests he continued with a slight smile i know that my proceeding is quite out of order and that i have personally everything to lose by it and in a larger way probably very little to gain but i thought mrs westmores attention ought to be called to certain conditions at the mills and no one else seemed likely to speak of them may i ask why you assume that mr truscomb will not do so when he has the opportunity amherst could not repress a smile because it is owing to mr truscomb that they exist the real object of your visit then said mr tredegar speaking with deliberation is er an underhand attack on your managers methods amhersts face darkened but he kept his temper i see nothing especially underhand in my course except the other interposed ironically that you have waited to speak till mr truscomb was not in a position to defend himself i never had the chance before it was at mrs westmores own suggestion that i took her over the mills and feeling as i do i should have thought it cowardly to shirk the chance of pointing out to her the conditions there mr tredegar mused his eyes still bent on his gentlyoscillating foot whenever a sufficient pressure from without parted the fog of selfcomplacency in which he moved he had a shrewd enough outlook on men and motives and it may be that the vigorous ring of amhersts answer had effected this momentary clearing of the air at any rate his next words were spoken in a more accessible tone to what conditions do you refer to the conditions under which the millhands work and live to the whole management of the mills in fact in relation to the people employed that is a large question pardon my possible ignorance mr tredegar paused to make sure that his hearer took in the full irony of this but surely in this state there are liability and inspection laws for the protection of the operatives there are such laws yes but most of them are either a dead letter or else so easily evaded that no employer thinks of conforming to them no employer then your specific charge against the westmore mills is part of a general arraignment of all employers of labour by no means sir i only meant that where the hands are well treated it is due rather to the personal goodwill of the employer than to any fear of the law and in what respect do you think the westmore hands unfairly treated amherst paused to measure his words the question as you say is a large one he rejoined it has its roots in the way the business is organized in the traditional attitude of the company toward the operatives i hoped that mrs westmore might return to the mills might visit some of the people in their houses seeing their way of living it might have occurred to her to ask a reason for it and one enquiry would have led to another she spoke this morning of going to the hospital to see dillon she did go to the hospital i went with her but as dillon was sleeping and as the matron told us he was much better a piece of news which i am happy to say dr disbrow has just confirmed she did not go up to the ward amherst was silent and mr tredegar pursued i gather from your bringing up dillons case that for some reason you consider it typical of the defects you find in mr truscombs management suppose therefore we drop generalizations and confine ourselves to the particular instance what wrong in your view has been done the dillons he turned as he spoke to extract a cigar from the box at his elbow let me offer you one mr amherst we shall talk more comfortably he suggested with distant affability but amherst with a gesture of refusal plunged into his exposition of the dillon case he tried to put the facts succinctly presenting them in their bare ugliness without emotional drapery setting forth dillons good record for sobriety and skill dwelling on the fact that his wifes illhealth was the result of perfectly remediable conditions in the workrooms and giving his reasons for the belief that the accident had been caused not by dillons carelessness but by the overcrowding of the cardingroom mr tredegar listened attentively though the cloud of cigarsmoke between himself and amherst masked from the latter his possible changes of expression when he removed his cigar his face looked smaller than ever as though desiccated by the fumes of the tobacco have you ever called mr gainess attention to these matters no that would have been useless he has always refused to discuss the condition of the mills with any one but the manager hm that would seem to prove that mr gaines who lives here sees as much reason for trusting truscombs judgment as mr westmore who delegated his authority from a distance amherst did not take this up and after a pause mr tredegar went on you

much slighter than it ought to be to serve your purpose dr disbrow has just told us that he will probably get off with the loss of a finger and i need hardly say that whatever may have been dillons own share in causing the accident and as to this as you admit opinions differ mrs westmore will assume all the expenses of his nursing besides making a liberal gift to his wife mr tredegar laid down his cigar and drew forth a silvermounted notecase here in fact he continued is a cheque which she asks you to transmit and which as i think you will agree ought to silence on your part as well as mrs dillons any criticism of mrs westmores dealings with her operatives the blood rose to amhersts forehead and he just restrained himself from pushing back the cheque which mr tredegar had laid on the table between them there is no question of criticizing mrs westmores dealings with her operatives as far as i know she has had none as yet he rejoined unable to control his voice as completely as his hand and the proof of it is the impunity with which her agents deceive her in this case for instance of dillons injury dr disbrow who is mr truscombs brotherinlaw and apt to be influenced by his views assures you that the man will get off with the loss of a finger but some one equally competent to speak told me last night that he would lose not only his hand but his arm amhersts voice had swelled to a deep note of anger and with his tossed hair and eyes darkening under furrowed brows he presented an image of revolutionary violence which deepened the disdain on mr tredegars lip some one equally competent to speak are you prepared to name this anonymous authority amherst hesitated no i shall have to ask you to take my word for it he returned with a shade of embarrassment ah mr tredegar murmured giving to the expressive syllable its utmost measure of decent exultation amherst quivered under the thin lash and broke out it is all you have required of dr disbrow but at this point mr tredegar rose to his feet my dear sir your resorting to such arguments convinces me that nothing is to be gained by prolonging our talk i will not even take up your insinuations against two of the most respected men in the community such charges reflect only on those who make them amherst whose flame of anger had subsided with the sudden sense of its futility received this in silence and the lawyer reassured continued with a touch of condescension my only specific charge from mrs westmore was to hand you this cheque but in spite of what has passed i take it upon myself to add in her behalf that your conduct of today will not be allowed to weigh against your record at the mills and that the extraordinary charges you have seen fit to bring against your superiors will if not repeated simply be ignored when the next morning at about ten mrs eustace ansell joined herself to the two gentlemen who still lingered over a desultory breakfast in mrs westmores diningroom she responded to their greeting with less than her usual vivacity illustration no i shall have to ask you to take my word for it it was one of mrs ansells arts to bring to the breakfasttable just the right shade of sprightliness a warmth subdued by discretion as the early sunlight is tempered by the lingering coolness of night she was in short as fresh as temperate as the hour yet without the concomitant chill which too often marks its human atmosphere rather her soft effulgence dissipated the morning frosts opening pinched spirits to a promise of midday warmth but on this occasion a mist of uncertainty hung on her smile and veiled the glance which she turned on the contents of the heavy silver dishes successively presented to her notice when at the conclusion of this ceremony the servants had withdrawn she continued for a moment to stir her tea in silence while her glance travelled from mr tredegar sunk in his morning mail to mr langhope who leaned back resignedly in his chair trying to solace himself with hanaford banner till midday should bring him a sight of the metropolitan press i suppose you know she said suddenly that bessy has telegraphed for cicely and made her arrangements to stay here another week mr langhopes stick slipped to the floor with the sudden displacement of his whole lounging person and mr tredegar removing his tortoiseshell readingglasses put them hastily into their case as though to declare for instant departure my dear maria mr langhope gasped while she rose and restored his stick she considers it then her duty to wait and see truscomb the lawyer asked and mrs ansell regaining her seat murmured discreetly she puts it so yes my dear maria mr langhope repeated helplessly tossing aside his paper and drawing his chair up to the table but it would be perfectly easy to return it is quite unnecessary to wait here for his recovery mr tredegar pursued as though setting forth a fact which had not hitherto presented itself to the more limited intelligence of his hearers mr langhope emitted a short laugh and mrs ansell answered gently she says she detests the long journey mr tredegar rose and gathered up his letters with a gesture of annoyance in that case if i had been notified earlier of this decision i might have caught the morning train he interrupted himself glancing resentfully at his watch oh dont leave us tredegar mr langhope entreated well reason with her well persuade her to go back by the threeforty mrs ansell smiled she telegraphed at seven cicely and the governess are already on their way at seven but my dear friend why on earth didnt you tell us i didnt know till a few minutes ago bessy called me in as i was coming down ah mr langhope murmured meeting her eyes for a fraction of a second in the encounter she appeared to communicate something more than she had spoken for as he stooped to pick up his paper he said more easily my dear tredegar if were in a box theres no reason why we should force you into it too ring for ropes and well look up a train for you mr tredegar appeared slightly ruffled at this prompt acquiescence in his threatened departure of course if i had been notified in advance i might have arranged to postpone my engagements another day but in any case it is quite out of the question that i should return in a week and quite unnecessary he added snapping his lips shut as though he were closing his last portmanteau oh quite quite mr langhope assented it isnt in fact in the least necessary for any of us either to stay on now or to return truscomb could come to long island when he recovers and answer any questions we may have to put but if bessy has sent for the child we must of course put off going for today at least i must he added sighing and though i know its out of the question to exact such a sacrifice from you i have a faint hope that our delightful friend here with the altruistic spirit of her sex oh i shall enjoy it my maid is unpacking mrs ansell gaily affirmed and mr tredegar shrugging his shoulders said curtly in that case i will ring for the timetable when he had withdrawn to consult it in the seclusion of the library and mrs ansell affecting a sudden desire for a second cup of tea had reseated herself to await the replenishment of the kettle mr langhope exchanged his own chair for a place at her side now what on earth does this mean he asked lighting a cigarette in response to her slight nod of consent mrs ansells gaze lost itself in the depths of the empty teapot a number of things or any one of them she said at length extending her arm toward the teacaddy for instance he rejoined following appreciatively the movements of her long slim hands she raised her head and met his eyes for instance it may mean dont resent the suggestion that you and mr tredegar were not quite welladvised in persuading her not to see mr amherst yesterday evening mr langhope uttered an exclamation of surprise but my dear maria in the name of reasonwhy after the doctors visit after his coming here last night at truscombs request to put the actual facts before her should she have gone over the whole business again with this interfering young fellow how in fact could she have done so he added after vainly waiting for her reply without putting a sort of slight on truscomb who is after all the only person entitled to speak with authority mrs ansell received his outburst in silence and the butler reappearing with the kettle and fresh toast gave her the chance to prolong her pause for a full minute when the door had closed on him she said judged by reason your arguments are unanswerable but when it comes to a question of feeling feeling what kind of feeling you dont mean to suggest anything so preposterous as that bessy she made a gesture of smiling protest i confess it is to be regretted that his mother is a lady and that he looks you must have noticed it so amazingly like the portraits of the young schiller but i only meant that bessy forms all her opinions emotionally and that she must have been very strongly affected by the scene mr tredegar described to us ah mr langhope interjected replying first to her parenthesis how a woman of your good sense stumbled on that idea of hunting up the mother but mrs ansell answered with a slight grimace my dear henry if you could see the house they live in youd think i had been providentially guided there and reverting to the main issue he went on fretfully but why after hearing the true version of the facts should bessy still be influenced by that sensational scene even if it was not as tredegar suspects cooked up expressly to take her in she must see that the hospital doctor is after all as likely as any one to know how the accident really happened and how seriously the fellow is hurt theres the point why should bessy believe dr disbrow rather than mr amherst for the best of reasons because disbrow has nothing to gain by distorting the facts whereas this young amherst as tredegar pointed out has the very obvious desire to give truscomb a bad name and shove himself into his place mrs ansell contemplatively turned the rings upon her fingers from what i saw of amherst im inclined to think that if that is his object he is too clever to have shown his hand so soon but if you are right was there not all the more reason for letting bessy see him and find out as soon as possible what he was aiming at if one could have trusted her to find out but you credit my poor child with more penetration than ive ever seen in her perhaps youve looked for it at the wrong time and about the wrong things bessy has the penetration of the heart the heart you make mine jump when you use such expressions oh i use this one in a general sense but i want to help you to keep it from acquiring a more restricted significance restricted to the young man himself mrs ansells expressive hands seemed to commit the question to fate all i ask you to consider for the present is that bessy is quite unoccupied and excessively bored bored why she has everything on earth she can want the ideal state for producing boredom the only atmosphere in which it really thrives and besides to be humanly inconsistent theres just one thing she hasnt got well mr langhope groaned fortifying himself with a second cigarette an occupation for that rudimentary little organ the mention of which makes you jump there you go again good heavens maria do you want to encourage her to fall in love not with a man just at present but with a hobby an interest by all means if she doesnt the man will take the place of the interest theres a vacuum to be filled and human nature abhors a vacuum mr langhope shrugged his shoulders i dont follow you she adored her husband his friends fine smile was like a magnifying glass silently applied to the gross stupidity of his remark oh i dont say it was a great passion but they got on perfectly he corrected himself so perfectly that you must expect her to want a little storm and stress for a change the mere fact that you and mr tredegar objected to her seeing mr amherst last night has roused the spirit of opposition in her a year ago she hadnt any spirit of opposition there was nothing for her to oppose poor dick made her life so preposterously easy my ingenuous friend do you still think thats any reason the fact is bessy wasnt awake she wasnt even born then she is now and you know the infants first conscious joy is to smash things it will be rather an expensive joy if the mills are the first thing she smashes oh i imagine the mills are pretty substantial i should i own mrs ansell smiled not object to seeing her try her teeth on them which in terms of practical conduct means that i advise you not to disapprove of her staying on or of her investigating the young mans charges you must remember that another peculiarity of the infant mind is to tire soonest of the toy that no one tries to take away from it que diable but suppose truscomb turns rusty at this very unusual form of procedure perhaps you dont quite know how completely he represents the prosperity of the mills all the more reason mrs ansell persisted rising at the sound of mr tredegars approach for dont you perceive my poor distracted friend that if truscomb turns rusty as he undoubtedly will the inevitable result will be his managers dismissal and that thereafter there will presumably be peace in warsaw ah you divinely wicked woman cried mr langhope snatching at an appreciative pressure of her hand as the lawyer reappeared in the doorway vi before daylight that same morning amherst dressing by the gasflame above his cheap washstand strove to bring some order into his angry thoughts it humbled him to feel his purpose tossing rudderless on unruly waves of emotion yet strive as he would he could not regain a hold on it the events of the last twentyfour hours had been too rapid and unexpected for him to preserve his usual clear feeling of mastery and he had besides to reckon with the first complete surprise of his senses his way of life had excluded him from all contact with the subtler feminine influences and the primitive side of the relation left his imagination untouched he was therefore the more assailable by those refined forms of the ancient spell that lurk in delicacy of feeling interpreted by loveliness of face by his own choice he had cut himself off from all possibility of such communion had accepted complete abstinence for that part of his nature which might have offered a refuge from the stern prose of his daily task but his personal indifference to his surroundings deliberately encouraged as a defiance to the attractions of the life he had renounced proved no defence against this appeal rather the meanness of his surroundings combined with his inherited refinement of taste to deepen the effect of bessys charm as he reviewed the incidents of the past hours a reaction of selfderision came to his aid what was this exquisite opportunity from which he had cut himself off what to reduce the question to a personal issue had mrs westmore said or done that on the part of a plain woman would have quickened his pulses by the least fraction of a second why it was only the old story of the length of cleopatras nose because her eyes were a heavenly vehicle for sympathy because her voice was pitched to thrill the tender chords he had been deluded into thinking that she understood and responded to his appeal and her own emotions had been wrought upon by means as cheap it was only the obvious theatrical side of the incident that had affected her if dillons wife had been old and ugly would she have been clasped to her employers bosom a more expert knowledge of the sex would have told amherst that such ready sympathy is likely to be followed by as prompt a reaction of indifference luckily mrs westmores course had served as a corrective for his lack of experience she had even as it appeared been at some pains to hasten the process of disillusionment this timely discipline left him blushing at his own insincerity for he now saw that he had risked his future not because of his zeal for the welfare of the millhands but because mrs westmores look was like sunshine on his frozen senses and because he was resolved at any cost to arrest her attention to associate himself with her by the only means in his power well he deserved to fail with such an end in view and the futility of his scheme was matched by the vanity of his purpose in the cold light of disenchantment it seemed as though he had tried to build an impregnable fortress out of nursery blocks how could he have foreseen anything but failure for so preposterous an attempt his breach of discipline would of course be reported at once to mr gaines and truscomb and the manager already jealous of his assistants popularity with the hands which was a tacit criticism of his own methods would promptly seize the pretext to be rid of him amherst was aware that only his technical efficiency and his knack of getting the maximum of work out of the operatives had secured him from truscombs animosity from the outset there had been small sympathy between the two but the scarcity of competent and hardworking assistants had made truscomb endure him for what he was worth to the mills now however his own folly had put the match to the managers smouldering dislike and he saw himself in consequence discharged and blacklisted and perhaps roaming for months in quest of a job he knew the efficiency of that farreaching system of defamation whereby the employers of labour pursue and punish the subordinate who incurs their displeasure in the case of a mere operative this secret persecution often worked complete ruin and even to a man of amhersts worth it opened the dispiriting prospect of a long struggle for rehabilitation deep down he suffered most at the thought that his blow for the operatives had failed but on the surface it was the manner of his failure that exasperated him for it seemed to prove him unfit for the very work to which he was drawn that yearning to help the world forward that in some natures sets the measure to which the personal adventure must keep step amherst had hitherto felt himself secured by his insight and selfcontrol from the emotional errors besetting the way of the enthusiast and behold he had stumbled into the first sentimental trap in his path and tricked his eyes with a christmaschromo vision of lovely woman dispensing coals and blankets luckily though such wounds to his selfconfidence cut deep he could apply to them the antiseptic of an unfailing humour and before he had finished dressing the picture of his wide schemes of social reform contracting to a blueeyed philanthropy of cheques and groceries had provoked a reaction of laughter perhaps the laughter came too soon and rang too loud to be true to the core but at any rate it healed the edges of his hurt and gave him a sound surface of composure but he could not laugh away the thought of the trials to which his intemperance had probably exposed his mother and when at the breakfasttable from which duplain had already departed she broke into praise of their visitor it was like a burning irritant on his wound what a face john of course i dont often see people of that kind now the words falling from her too simply to be reproachful wrung him for that all the more but im sure that kind of soft loveliness is rare everywhere like a sweet summer morning with the mist on it the gaines girls now are my idea of the modern type very handsome of course but you see just how handsome the first minute i like a story that keeps one wondering till the end it was very kind of maria ansell mrs amherst wandered happily on to come and hunt me out yesterday and i enjoyed our quiet talk about old times but what i liked best was seeing mrs westmore and oh john if she came to live here what a benediction to the mills amherst was silent moved most of all by the unimpaired simplicity of heart with which his mother could take up past relations and open her meagre life to the high visitations of grace and fashion without a tinge of selfconsciousness or apology i shall never be as genuine as that he thought remembering how he had wished to have mrs westmore know that he was of her own class how mixed our passions are and how elastic must be the word that would cover any one of them amhersts at that moment were all stained with the deep wound to his selflove the discolouration he carried in his eye made the millvillage seem more than commonly cheerless and ugly as he walked over to the office after breakfast beyond the grim roofline of the factories a dazzle of rays sent upward from banked white clouds the promise of another brilliant day and he reflected that mrs westmore would soon be speeding home to the joy of a gallop over the plains far different was the task that awaited him yet it gave him a pang to think that he might be performing it for the last time in spite of mr tredegars assurances he was certain that the report of his conduct must by this time have reached the president and been transmitted to truscomb the latter was better that morning and the next day he would doubtless call his rebellious assistant to account amherst meanwhile took up his routine with a dull heart even should his offense be condoned his occupation presented in itself little future to a man without money or powerful connections money he had spurned the thought of it in choosing his work yet he now saw that without its aid he was powerless to accomplish the object to which his personal desires had been sacrificed his love of his craft had gradually been merged in the larger love for his fellowworkers and in the resulting desire to lift and widen their lot he had once fancied that this end might be attained by an internal revolution in the management of the westmore mills that he might succeed in creating an industrial objectlesson conspicuous enough to point the way to wiser lawmaking and juster relations between the classes but the last hours experiences had shown him how vain it was to assault singlehanded the strong barrier between money and labour and how his own dash at the breach had only thrust him farther back into the obscure ranks of the stragglers it was after all only through politics that he could return successfully to the attack and financial independence was the needful preliminary to a political career if he had stuck to the law he might by this time have been nearer his goal but then the gold might not have mattered since it was only by living among the workers that he had learned to care for their fate and rather than have forfeited that poignant yet mighty vision of the onward groping of the mass rather than have missed the widening of his own nature that had come through sharing their hopes and pains he would still have turned from the easier way have chosen the deeper initiation rather than the readier attainment but this philosophic view of the situation was a mere thread of light on the farthest verge of his sky much nearer were the clouds of immediate care amid which his own folly and his mothers possible suffering from it loomed darkest and these considerations made him resolve that if his insubordination were overlooked he would swallow the affront of a pardon and continue for the present in the mechanical performance of his duties he had just brought himself to this leaden state of acquiescence when one of the clerks in the outer office thrust his head in to say a lady asking for you and looking up amherst beheld bessy westmore she came in alone with an air of high selfpossession in marked contrast to her timidity and indecision of the previous day amherst thought she looked taller more majestic so readily may the upward slant of a soft chin the firmer line of yielding brows add a cubit to the outward woman her aspect was so commanding that he fancied she had come to express her disapproval of his conduct to rebuke him for lack of respect to mr tredegar but a moment later it became clear even to his inexperienced perceptions that it was not to himself that her challenge was directed she advanced toward the seat he had moved forward but in her absorption forgot to seat herself and stood with her clasped hands resting on the back of the chair i have come back to talk to you she began in her sweet voice with its occasional quick lift of appeal i knew that in mr truscombs absence it would be hard for you to leave the mills and there are one or two things i want you to explain before i go away some of the things for instance that you spoke to mr tredegar about last night amhersts feeling of constraint returned im afraid i expressed myself badly i may have annoyed him he began she smiled this away as though irrelevant to the main issue perhaps you dont quite understand each other but i am sure you can make it clear to me she sank into the chair resting one arm on the edge of the desk behind which he had resumed his place that is the reason why i came alone she continued i never can understand when a lot of people are trying to tell me a thing all at once and i dont suppose i care as much as a man would a lawyer especially about the forms that ought to be observed all i want is to find out what is wrong and how to remedy it her blue eyes met amhersts in a look that flowed like warmth about his heart how should he have doubted that her feelings were as exquisite as her means of expressing them the iron bands of distrust were loosened from his spirit and he blushed for his cheap scepticism of the morning in a woman so evidently nurtured in dependence whose views had been formed and her actions directed by the most conventional influences the mere fact of coming alone to westmore in open defiance of her advisers bespoke a persistence of purpose that put his doubts to shame it will make a great difference to the people here if you interest yourself in them he rejoined i tried to explain to mr tredegar that i had no wish to criticise the business management of the mills even if there had been any excuse for my doing so but that i was sure the condition of the operatives could be very much improved without permanent harm to the business by any one who felt a personal sympathy for them and in the end i believe such sympathy produces better work and so benefits the employer materially she listened with her gentle look of trust as though committing to him with the good faith of a child her ignorance her credulity her little rudimentary convictions and her little tentative aspirations relying on him not to abuse or misdirect them in the boundless supremacy of his masculine understanding that is just what i want you to explain to me she said but first i should like to know more about the poor man who was hurt i meant to see his wife yesterday but mr gaines told me she would be at work till six and it would have been difficult to go after that i did go to the hospital but the man was sleeping is dillon his name and the matron told us he was much better dr disbrow came in the evening and said the same thing told us it was all a false report about his having been so badly hurt and that mr truscomb was very much annoyed when he heard of your having said before the operatives that dillon would lose his arm amherst smiled ah mr truscomb heard that well hes right to be annoyed i ought not to have said it when i did but unfortunately i am not the only one to be punished the operative who tied on the black cloth was dismissed this morning mrs westmore flamed up dismissed for that oh how unjust how cruel you must look at both sides of the case said amherst finding it much easier to remain temperate in the glow he had kindled than if he had had to force his own heat into frozen veins of course any act of insubordination must be reprimanded but i think a reprimand would have been enough it gave him an undeniable throb of pleasure to find that she was not to be checked by such arguments but he shall be put back i wont have any one discharged for such a reason you must find him for me at once you must tell him once more amherst gently restrained her if youll forgive my saying so i think it is better to let him go and take his chance of getting work elsewhere if he were taken back he might be made to suffer as things are organized here the hands are very much at the mercy of the overseers and the overseer in that room would be likely to make it uncomfortable for a hand who had so openly defied him with a heavy sigh she bent her puzzled brows on him how complicated it is i wonder if i shall ever understand it all you dont think dillons accident was his own fault then certainly not there are too many cards in that room i pointed out the fact to mr truscomb when the new machines were set up three years ago an operative may be ever so expert with his fingers and yet not learn to measure his ordinary movements quite as accurately as if he were an automaton and that is what a man must do to be safe in the cardingroom she sighed again the more you tell me the more difficult it all seems why is the cardingroom so overcrowded to make it pay better amherst returned bluntly and the colour flushed her sensitive skin he thought she was about to punish him for his plainspeaking but she went on after a pause what you say is dreadful each thing seems to lead back to another and i feel so ignorant of it all she hesitated again and then said turning her bluest glance on him i am going to be quite frank with you mr amherst mr tredegar repeated to me what you said to him last night and i think he was annoyed that you were unwilling to give any proof of the charges you made charges ah amherst exclaimed with a start of recollection he means my refusing to say who told me that dr disbrow was not telling the truth about dillon yes he said that was a very grave accusation to make and that no one should have made it without being able to give proof that is quite true theoretically but in this case it would be easy for you or mr tredegar to find out whether i was right but mr tredegar said you refused to say who told you i was bound to as it happened but i am not bound to prevent your trying to get the same information ah she murmured understandingly and a sudden thought striking him he went on with a glance at the clock if you really wish to judge for yourself why not go to the hospital now i shall be free in five minutes and could go with you if you wish it amherst had remembered the nurses cry of recognition when she saw mrs westmores face under the streetlamp and it immediately occurred to him that if the two women had really known each other mrs westmore would have no difficulty in obtaining the information she wanted while even if they met as strangers the darkeyed girls perspicacity might still be trusted to come to their aid it remained only to be seen how mrs westmore would take his suggestion but some instinct was already telling him that the highhanded method was the one she really preferred to the hospital now i should like it of all things she exclaimed rising with what seemed an almost childish zest in the adventure of course that is the best way of finding out i ought to have insisted on seeing dillon yesterday but i begin to think the matron didnt want me to amherst left this inference to work itself out in her mind contenting himself as they drove back to hanaford with answering her questions about dillons family the ages of his children and his wifes health her enquiries he noticed did not extend from the particular to the general her curiosity as yet was too purely personal and emotional to lead to any larger consideration of the question but this larger view might grow out of the investigation of dillons case and meanwhile amhersts own purposes were momentarily lost in the sweet confusion of feeling her near him of seeing the exquisite grain of her skin the way her lashes grew out of a dusky line on the edge of the white lids the way her hair stealing in spirals of light from brow to ear wavered off into a fruity down on the edge of the cheek at the hospital they were protestingly admitted by mrs ogan though the official visitors hour was not till the afternoon and beside the sufferers bed amherst saw again that sudden flowering of compassion which seemed the key to his companions beauty as though her lips had been formed for consolation and her hands for tender offices it was clear enough that dillon still sunk in a torpor broken by feverish tossings was making no perceptible progress toward recovery and mrs ogan was reduced to murmuring some technical explanation about the state of the wound while bessy hung above him with reassuring murmurs as to his wifes fate and promises that the children should be cared for amherst had noticed on entering that a new nurse a gaping young woman instantly lost in the study of mrs westmores toilet had replaced the darkeyed attendant of the day before and supposing that the latter was temporarily off duty he asked mrs ogan if she might be seen the matrons face was a picture of genteel perplexity the other nurse our regular surgical nurse miss golden is ill miss hibbs here is replacing her for the present she indicated the gaping damsel then as amherst persisted ah she wondered negligently do you mean the young lady you saw here yesterday certainly i had forgotten miss brent was merely a er temporary substitute i believe she was recommended to dr disbrow by one of his patients but we found her quite unsuitable in fact unfitted and the doctor discharged her this morning mrs westmore had drawn near and while the matron delivered her explanation with an uneasy sorting and shifting of words a quick signal of intelligence passed between her hearers you see amhersts eyes exclaimed i see they have sent her away because she told you bessys flashed back in wrath and his answering look did not deny her inference do you know where she has gone amherst enquired but mrs ogan permitting her brows a faint lift of surprise replied that she had no idea of miss brents movements beyond having heard that she was to leave hanaford immediately in the carriage bessy exclaimed it was the nurse of course if we could only find her brent did mrs ogan say her name was brent do you know the name yes at least but it couldnt of course be the girl i knew miss brent saw you the night you arrived and thought she recognized you she said you and she had been at some school or convent together the sacred heart then it is justine brent i heard they had lost their money i havent seen her for years but how strange that she should be a hospital nurse and why is she at hanaford i wonder she was here only on a visit she didnt tell me where she lived she said she heard that a surgical nurse was wanted at the hospital and volunteered her services im afraid she got small thanks for them do you really think they sent her away for talking to you how do you suppose they found out i waited for her last night when she left the hospital and i suppose mrs ogan or one of the doctors saw us it was thoughtless of me amherst exclaimed with compunction i wish i had seen her poor justine we were the greatest friends at the convent she was the ringleader in all our mischief i never saw any one so quick and clever i suppose her fun is all gone now for a moment mrs westmores mind continued to linger among her memories then she reverted to the question of the dillons and of what might best be done for them if miss brents fears should be realized as the carriage neared her door she turned to her companion with extended hand thank you so much mr amherst i am glad you suggested that mr truscomb should find some work for dillon about the office but i must talk to you about this again can you come in this evening vii amherst could never afterward regain a detailed impression of the weeks that followed they lived in his memory chiefly as exponents of the unforeseen nothing he had looked for having come to pass in the way or at the time expected while the whole movement of life was like the noonday flow of a river in which the separate ripples of brightness are all merged in one blinding glitter his recurring conferences with mrs westmore formed as it were the small surprising kernel of fact about which sensations gathered and grew with the swift ripening of a magicians fruit that she should remain on at hanaford to look into the condition of the mills did not in itself seem surprising to amherst for his short phase of doubt had been succeeded by an abundant inflow of faith in her intentions it satisfied his inner craving for harmony that her face and spirit should after all so corroborate and complete each other that it needed no moral sophistry to adjust her acts to her appearance her words to the promise of her smile but her immediate confidence in him her resolve to support him in his avowed insubordination to ignore with the royal license of her sex all that was irregular and inexpedient in asking his guidance while the whole official strength of the company darkened the background with a gathering storm of disapproval this sense of being the glove flung by her hand in the face of convention quickened astonishingly the flow of amhersts sensations it was as though a mountainclimber braced to the strain of a hard ascent should suddenly see the way break into roses and level itself in a path for his feet on his second visit he found the two ladies together and mrs ansells smile of approval seemed to cast a social sanction on the episode to classify it as comfortably usual and unimportant he could see that her friends manner put bessy at ease helping her to ask her own questions and to reflect on his suggestions with less bewilderment and more selfconfidence mrs ansell had the faculty of restoring to her the belief in her reasoning powers that her father could dissolve in a monosyllable the talk on this occasion had turned mainly on the future of the dillon family on the best means of compensating for the accident and incidentally on the care of the young children of the millcolony though amherst did not believe in the extremer forms of industrial paternalism he was yet of opinion that where married women were employed the employer should care for their children he had been gradually and somewhat reluctantly brought to this conviction by the many instances of unavoidable neglect and suffering among the children of the womenworkers at westmore and mrs westmore took up the scheme with all the ardour of her young motherliness quivering at the thought of hungry or ailing children while her cicely leaning a silken head against her lifted puzzled eyes to her face on the larger problems of the case it was less easy to fix bessys attention but amherst was far from being one of the extreme theorists who reject temporary remedies lest they defer the day of general renewal and since he looked on every gain in the material condition of the millhands as a step in their moral growth he was quite willing to hold back his fundamental plans while he discussed the establishment of a nursery and of a nightschool for the boys in the mills the third time he called he found mr langhope and mr halford gaines of the company the president of the westmore mills was a trim middlesized man whose high pink varnish of good living would have turned to purple could he have known mr langhopes opinion of his jewelled shirtfront and the padded shoulders of his eveningcoat happily he had no inkling of these views and was fortified in his command of the situation by an unimpaired confidence in his own appearance while mr langhope discreetly withdrawn behind a veil of cigarsmoke let his silence play like a fine criticism over the various phases of the discussion it was a surprise to amherst to find himself in mr gainess presence the president secluded in his high office seldom visited the mills and when there showed no consciousness of any presence lower than truscombs and amhersts first thought was that in the managers enforced absence he was to be called to account by the head of the firm but he was affably welcomed by mr gaines who made it clear that his ostensible purpose in coming was to hear amhersts views as to the proposed nightschools and nursery these were pointedly alluded to as mrs westmores projects and the young man was made to feel that he was merely called in as a temporary adviser in truscombs absence this was in fact the position amherst preferred to take and he scrupulously restricted himself to the answering of questions letting mrs westmore unfold his plans as though they had been her own it is much better he reflected that they should all think so and she too for truscomb will be on his legs again in a day or two and then my hours will be numbered meanwhile he was surprised to find mr gaines oddly amenable to the proposed innovations which he appeared to regard as new fashions in millmanagement to be adopted for the same cogent reasons as a new cut in coattails of course we want to be uptodate theres no reason why the westmore mills shouldnt do as well by their people as any mills in the country he affirmed in the tone of the entertainer accustomed to say i want the thing done handsomely but he seemed even less conscious than mrs westmore that each particular wrong could be traced back to a radical vice in the system he appeared to think that every murmur of assent to her proposals passed the sponge once for all over the difficulty propounded as though a problem in algebra should be solved by wiping it off the blackboard my dear bessy we all owe you a debt of gratitude for coming here and bringing so to speak a fresh eye to bear on the subject if ive been perhaps a little too exclusively absorbed in making the mills profitable my friend langhope will i believe not be the first to er cast a stone at me mr gaines who was the soul of delicacy stumbled a little over the awkward associations connected with this figure but picking himself up hastened on to affirm and in that respect i think we can challenge comparison with any industry in the state but i am the first to admit that there may be another side a side that it takes a woman a mother to see for instance he threw in jocosely i flatter myself that i know how to order a good dinner but i always leave the flowers to my wife and if youll permit me to say so he went on encouraged by the felicity of his image i believe it will produce a most pleasing effect not only on the operatives themselves but on the whole of hanaford on our own set of people especially to have you come here and interest yourself in the er philanthropic side of the work bessy coloured a little she blushed easily and was perhaps not overdiscriminating as to the quality of praise received but under her ripple of pleasure a stronger feeling stirred and she said hastily i am afraid i never should have thought of these things if mr amherst had not pointed them out to me mr gaines met this blandly very gratifying to mr amherst to have you put it in that way and i am sure we all appreciate his valuable hints truscomb himself could not have been more helpful though his larger experience will no doubt be useful later on in developing and er modifying your plans it was difficult to reconcile this large view of the moral issue with the existence of abuses which made the management of the westmore mills as unpleasantly notorious in one section of the community as it was agreeably notable in another but amherst was impartial enough to see that mr gaines was unconscious of the incongruities of the situation he left the reconciling of incompatibles to truscomb with the simple faith of the believer committing a like task to his maker it was in the managers mind that the dark processes of adjustment took place mr gaines cultivated the convenient and popular idea that by ignoring wrongs one is not so much condoning as actually denying their existence and in pursuance of this belief he devoutly abstained from studying the conditions at westmore a farther surprise awaited amherst when truscomb reappeared in the office the manager was always a man of few words and for the first days his intercourse with his assistant was restricted to asking questions and issuing orders soon afterward it became known that dillons arm was to be amputated and that afternoon truscomb was summoned to see mrs westmore when he returned he sent for amherst and the young man felt sure that his hour had come he was at dinner when the message reached him and he knew from the tightening of his mothers lips that she too interpreted it in the same way he was glad that duplains presence kept her from speaking her fears and he thanked her inwardly for the smile with which she watched him go that evening when he returned the smile was still at its post but it dropped away wearily as he said with his hands on her shoulders dont worry mother i dont know exactly whats happening but were not blacklisted yet mrs amherst had immediately taken up her work letting her nervous tension find its usual escape through her fingertips her needles flagged as she lifted her eyes to his something is happening then she murmured oh a number of things evidently but though im in the heart of them i cant yet make out how they are going to affect me his mothers glance twinkled in time with the flash of her needles theres always a safe place in the heart of a storm she said shrewdly and amherst rejoined with a laugh well if its truscombs heart i dont know that its particularly safe for me tell me just what he said john she begged making no attempt to carry the pleasantry farther though its possibilities still seemed to flicker about her lip and amherst proceeded to recount his talk with the manager truscomb it appeared had made no allusion to dillon his avowed purpose in summoning his assistant had been to discuss with the latter the question of the proposed nursery and schools mrs westmore at amhersts suggestion had presented these projects as her own but the question of a site having come up she had mentioned to truscomb his assistants proposal that the company should buy for the purpose the notorious eldorado the roadhouse in question had always been one of the most destructive influences in the millcolony and amherst had made one or two indirect attempts to have the building converted to other uses but the persistent opposition he encountered gave colour to the popular report that the manager took a high toll from the landlord it therefore at once occurred to amherst to suggest the purchase of the property to mrs westmore and he was not surprised to find that truscombs opposition to the scheme centred in the choice of the building but even at this point the manager betrayed no open resistance he seemed tacitly to admit amhersts right to discuss the proposed plans and even to be consulted concerning the choice of a site he was ready with a dozen good reasons against the purchase of the roadhouse but here also he proceeded with a discretion unexampled in his dealings with his subordinates he acknowledged the harm done by the dancehall but objected that he could not conscientiously advise the company to pay the extortionate price at which it was held and reminded amherst that if that particular source of offense were removed others would inevitably spring up to replace it marshalling the usual temporizing arguments of tolerance and expediency with no marked change from his usual tone till just as the interview was ending he asked with a sudden drop to conciliation if the assistant manager had anything to complain of in the treatment he received this came as such a surprise to amherst that before he had collected himself he found truscomb ambiguously but unmistakably offering him with the practised indirection of the man accustomed to cover his share in such transactions a substantial consideration for dropping the matter of the roadhouse it was incredible yet it had really happened the allpowerful truscomb who held westmore in the hollow of his hand had stooped to bribing his assistant because he was afraid to deal with him in a more summary manner amhersts leap of anger at the offer was curbed by the instant perception of its cause he had no time to search for a reason he could only rally himself to meet the unintelligible with a composure as abysmal as truscombs and his voice still rang with the wonder of the incident as he retailed it to his mother think of what it means mother for a young woman like mrs westmore without any experience or any habit of authority to come here and at the first glimpse of injustice to be so revolted that she finds the courage and cleverness to put her little hand to the machine and reverse the engines for its nothing less that shes done oh i know therell be a reaction the pendulums sure to swing back but youll see it wont swing as far of course i shall go in the end but truscomb may go too jove if i could pull him down on me like whatshisname and the pillars of the temple he had risen and was measuring the little sittingroom with his long strides his head flung back and his eyes dark with the inward look his mother had not always cared to see there but now her own glance seemed to have caught a ray from his and the knitting flowed from her hands like the thread of fate as she sat silent letting him exhale his hopes and his wonder and murmuring only when he dropped again to the chair at her side you wont go johnny you wont go mrs westmore lingered on for over two weeks and during that time amherst was able in various directions to develop her interest in the millworkers his own schemes involved a complete readjustment of the relation between the company and the hands the suppression of the obsolete company store and tenements which had so long sapped the thrift and ambition of the workers the transformation of the hopewood grounds into a park and athletic field and the division of its remaining acres into building lots for the millhands the establishing of a library a dispensary and emergency hospital and various other centres of humanizing influence but he refrained from letting her see that his present suggestion was only a part of this larger plan lest her growing sympathy should be checked he had in his mother an example of the mind accessible only to concrete impressions the mind which could die for the particular instance yet remain serenely indifferent to its causes to mrs amherst her sons work had been interesting simply because it was his work remove his presence from westmore and the whole industrial problem became to her as nonexistent as stardust to the naked eye and in bessy westmore he divined a nature of the same quality divined but no longer criticized it was not that concentration on the personal issue just the compensating grace of her sex did it not offer a warm tint of human inconsistency to eyes chilled by contemplating life in the mass it pleased amherst for the moment to class himself with the impersonal student of social problems though in truth his interest in them had its source in an imagination as open as bessys to the pathos of the personal appeal but if he had the same sensitiveness how inferior were his means of expressing it again and again during their talks he had the feeling which had come to him when she bent over dillons bed that her exquisite lines were in some mystical sense the visible flowering of her nature that they had taken shape in response to the inward motions of the heart to a young man ruled by high enthusiasms there can be no more dazzling adventure than to work this miracle in the tender creature who yields her mind to his to see as it were the blossoming of the spiritual seed in forms of heightened loveliness the bluer beam of the eye the richer curve of the lip all the physical currents of life quickening under the breath of a kindled thought it did not occur to him that any other emotion had effected the change he perceived bessy westmore had in full measure that gift of unconscious hypocrisy which enables a woman to make the man in whom she is interested believe that she enters into all his thoughts she had more than this the gift of selfdeception supreme happiness of the unreflecting nature whereby she was able to believe herself solely engrossed in the subjects they discussed to regard him as the mere spokesman of important ideas thus saving their intercourse from present constraint and from the awkward contemplation of future contingencies so in obedience to the ancient sorcery of life these two groped for and found each other in regions seemingly so remote from the accredited domain of romance that it would have been as a great surprise to them to learn whither they had strayed as to see the arid streets of westmore suddenly bursting into leaf with mrs westmores departure amherst for the first time became aware of a certain flatness in his life his daily task seemed dull and purposeless and he was galled by truscombs studied forbearance under which he suspected a quickly accumulating store of animosity he almost longed for some collision which would release the managers pentup resentment yet he dreaded increasingly any accident that might make his stay at westmore impossible it was on sundays when he was freed from his weekly task that he was most at the mercy of these opposing feelings they drove him forth on long solitary walks beyond the town walks ending most often in the deserted grounds of hopewood beautiful now in the ruined gold of october as he sat under the beechlimbs above the river watching its brown current sweep the willowroots of the banks he thought how this same current within its next short reach passed from wooded seclusion to the noise and pollution of the mills so his own life seemed to have passed once more from the tranced flow of the last weeks into its old channel of unillumined labour but other thoughts came to him too the vision of converting that melancholy pleasureground into an outlet for the cramped lives of the millworkers and he pictured the weedgrown lawns and paths thronged with holidaymakers and the slopes nearer the factories dotted with houses and gardens an unexpected event revived these hopes a few days before christmas it became known to hanaford that mrs westmore would return for the holidays cicely was drooping in town air and bessy had persuaded mr langhope that the bracing cold of hanaford would be better for the child than the milder atmosphere of long island they reappeared and brought with them a breath of holiday cheerfulness such as westmore had never known it had always been the rule at the mills to let the operatives take their pleasure as they saw fit and the eldorado and the hanaford saloons throve on this policy but mrs westmore arrived full of festal projects there was to be a giant christmas tree for the millchildren a supper on the same scale for the operatives and a bout of skating and coasting at hopewood for the older lads the band and bobbin boys in whom amherst had always felt a special interest the gaines ladies resolved to show themselves at home in the latest philanthropic fashions actively seconded bessys endeavours and for a week westmore basked under a sudden heatwave of beneficence the time had passed when amherst might have made light of such efforts with bessy westmore smiling up hollyladen from the foot of the ladder on which she kept him perched how could he question the efficacy of hanging the openingroom with christmas wreaths or the ultimate benefit of gorging the operatives with turkey and sheathing their offspring in red mittens it was just like the end of a storybook with a pretty moral and amherst was in the mood to be as much taken by the tinsel as the youngest millbaby held up to gape at the tree at the new year when mrs westmore left the negotiations for the purchase of the eldorado were well advanced and it was understood that on their completion she was to return for the opening of the nightschool and nursery suddenly however it became known that the proprietor of the roadhouse had decided not to sell amherst heard of the decision from duplain and at once foresaw the inevitable result that mrs westmores plan would be given up owing to the difficulty of finding another site mr gaines and truscomb had both discountenanced the erection of a special building for what was after all only a tentative enterprise among the purchasable houses in westmore no other was suited to the purpose and they had therefore a good excuse for advising bessy to defer her experiment almost at the same time however another piece of news changed the aspect of affairs a scandalous occurrence at the eldorado witnesses to which were unexpectedly forthcoming put it in amhersts power to threaten the landlord with exposure unless he should at once accept the companys offer and withdraw from westmore amherst had no long time to consider the best means of putting this threat into effect he knew it was not only idle to appeal to truscomb but essential to keep the facts from him till the deed was done yet how obtain the authority to act without him the seemingly insuperable difficulties of the situation whetted amhersts craving for a struggle he thought first of writing to mrs westmore but now that the spell of her presence was withdrawn he felt how hard it would be to make her understand the need of prompt and secret action and besides was it likely that at such short notice she could command the needful funds prudence opposed the attempt and on reflection he decided to appeal to mr gaines hoping that the flagrancy of the case would rouse the president from his usual attitude of indifference mr gaines was roused to the extent of showing a profound resentment against the cause of his disturbance he relieved his sense of responsibility by some didactic remarks on the vicious tendencies of the workingclasses and concluded with the reflection that the more you did for them the less thanks you got but when amherst showed an unwillingness to let the matter rest on this timehonoured aphorism the president retrenched himself behind ambiguities suggestions that they should await mrs westmores return and general considerations of a pessimistic nature tapering off into a gloomy view of the weather by god ill write to her amherst exclaimed as the gaines portals closed on him and all the way back to westmore he was busy marshalling his arguments and entreaties he wrote the letter that night but did not post it some unavowed distrust of her restrained him a distrust not of her heart but of her intelligence he felt that the whole future of westmore was at stake and decided to await the development of the next twentyfour hours the letter was still in his pocket when after dinner he was summoned to the office by truscomb that evening when he returned home he entered the little sittingroom without speaking his mother sat there alone in her usual place how many nights he had seen the lamplight slant at that particular angle across her fresh cheek and the fine wrinkles about her eyes he was going to add another wrinkle to the number now soon they would creep down and encroach upon the smoothness of the cheek she looked up and saw that his glance was turned to the crowded bookshelves behind her there must be nearly a thousand of them he said as their eyes met books yes with your fathers why were you thinking she started up suddenly and crossed over to him too many for wanderers he continued drawing her hands to his breast then as she clung to him weeping and trembling a little it had to be mother he said kissing her penitently where the fine wrinkles died into the cheek viii amhersts dismissal was not to take effect for a month and in the interval he addressed himself steadily to his task he went through the routine of the work numbly but his intercourse with the hands tugged at deep fibres of feelings he had always shared as far as his duties allowed in the cares and interests of their few free hours the hours when the automatic appendages of the giant machine became men and women again with desires and passions of their own under amhersts influence the mixed elements of the millcommunity had begun to crystallize into social groups his books had served as an improvised lendinglibrary he had organized a club a rudimentary orchestra and various other means of binding together the better spirits of the community with the older men the attractions of the eldorado and kindred inducements often worked against him but among the younger hands and especially the boys he had gained a personal ascendency that it was bitter to relinquish it was the severing of this tie that cost him most pain in the final days at westmore and after he had done what he could to console his mother and to put himself in the way of getting work elsewhere he tried to see what might be saved out of the ruins of the little polity he had built up he hoped his influence might at least persist in the form of an awakened instinct of fellowship and he gave every spare hour to strengthening the links he had tried to form the boys at any rate would be honestly sorry to have him go not indeed from the profounder reasons that affected him but because he had not only stood persistently between the overseers and themselves but had recognized their right to fun after workhours as well as their right to protection while they worked in the glow of mrs westmores christmas visitation an athletic club had been formed and leave obtained to use the hopewood grounds for saturday afternoon sports and thither amherst continued to conduct the boys after the mills closed at the weekend his last saturday had now come a shining afternoon of late february with a red sunset bending above frozen river and slopes of unruffled snow for an hour or more he had led the usual sports coasting down the steep descent from the house to the edge of the woods and skating and playing hockey on the rough riverice which eager hands kept clear after every snowstorm he always felt the contagion of these sports the glow of movement the tumult of young voices the sting of the winter air roused all the boyhood in his blood but today he had to force himself through his part in the performance to the very last as he now saw he had hoped for a sign in the heavens not the reversal of his own sentence for merely on disciplinary grounds he perceived that to be impossible but something pointing to a change in the management of the mills some proof that mrs westmores intervention had betokened more than a passing impulse of compassion surely she would not accept without question the abandonment of her favourite scheme and if she came back to put the question the answer would lay bare the whole situation so amhersts hopes had persuaded him but the day before he had heard that she was to sail for europe the report first announced in the papers had been confirmed by his mother who brought back from a visit to hanaford the news that mrs westmore was leaving at once for an indefinite period and that the hanaford house was to be closed irony would have been the readiest caustic for the wound inflicted but amherst for that very reason disdained it he would not taint his disappointment with mockery but would leave it among the unspoiled sadnesses of life he flung himself into the boys sports with his usual energy meaning that their last saturday with him should be their merriest but he went through his part mechanically and was glad when the sun began to dip toward the rim of the woods he was standing on the ice where the river widened just below the house when a jingle of bells broke on the still air and he saw a sleigh driven rapidly up the avenue amherst watched it in surprise who at that hour could be invading the winter solitude of hopewood the sleigh halted near the closed house and a muffled figure alighting alone began to move down the snowy slope toward the skaters in an instant he had torn off his skates and was bounding up the bank he would have known the figure anywhere known that lovely poise of the head the mixture of hesitancy and quickness in the light tread which even the snow could not impede halfway up the slope to the house they met and mrs westmore held out her hand face and lips as she stood above him glowed with her swift passage through the evening air and in the blaze of the sunset she seemed saturated with heavenly fires i drove out to find you they told me you were here i arrived this morning quite suddenly she broke off as though the encounter had checked her ardour instead of kindling it but he drew no discouragement from her tone i hoped you would come before i left i knew you would he exclaimed and at his last words her face clouded anxiously i didnt know you were leaving westmore till yesterday the day before i got a letter again she wavered perceptibly trusting her difficulty to him in the sweet way he had been trying to forget and he answered with recovered energy the great thing is that you should be here she shook her head at his optimism what can i do if you go you can give me a chance before i go to tell you a little about some of the loose ends i am leaving but why are you leaving them i dont understand is it inevitable inevitable he returned with an odd glow of satisfaction in the word and as her eyes besought him he added smiling ive been dismissed you see and from the managers standpoint i think i deserved it but the best part of my work neednt go with me and that is what i should like to speak to you about as assistant manager i can easily be replaced have been i understand already but among these boys here i should like to think that a little of me stayed and it will if youll let me tell you what ive been doing illustration halfway up the slope to the house they met she glanced away from him at the busy throng on the ice and at the other black cluster above the coastingslide how theyre enjoying it she murmured what a pity it was never done before and who will keep it up when youre gone you he answered meeting her eyes again and as she coloured a little under his look he went on quickly will you come over and look at the coasting the time is almost up one more slide and theyll be packing off to supper she nodded yes and they walked in silence over the white lawn crisscrossed with tramplings of happy feet to the ridge from which the coasters started on their run amhersts object in turning the talk had been to gain a moments respite he could not bear to waste his perfect hour in futile explanations he wanted to keep it undisturbed by any thought of the future and the same feeling seemed to possess his companion for she did not speak again till they reached the knoll where the boys were gathered a sled packed with them hung on the brink with a last shout it was off dipping down the incline with the long curved flight of a swallow flashing across the wide meadow at the base of the hill and tossed upward again by its own impetus till it vanished in the dark rim of wood on the opposite height the lads waiting on the knoll sang out for joy and bessy clapped her hands and joined with them what fun i wish id brought cicely ive not coasted for years she laughed out as the second detachment of boys heaped themselves on another sled and shot down amherst looked at her with a smile he saw that every other feeling had vanished in the exhilaration of watching the flight of the sleds she had forgotten why she had come forgotten her distress at his dismissal forgotten everything but the spell of the long white slope and the tingle of cold in her veins shall we go down should you like it he asked feeling no resentment under the heightened glow of his pulses oh do take me i shall love it her eyes shone like a childs she might have been a lovelier embodiment of the shouting boyhood about them the first band of coasters sled at heels had by this time already covered a third of the homeward stretch but amherst was too impatient to wait plunging down to the meadow he caught up the sledrope and raced back with the pack of rejoicing youth in his wake the sharp climb up the hill seemed to fill his lungs with flame his whole body burned with a strange intensity of life as he reached the top a distant bell rang across the fields from westmore and the boys began to snatch up their coats and mufflers be off with you ill look after the sleds amherst called to them as they dispersed then he turned for a moment to see that the skaters below were also heeding the summons a cold pallor lay on the riverbanks and on the low meadow beneath the knoll but the woodland opposite stood black against scarlet vapours that ravelled off in sheer light toward a sky hung with an icy moon amherst drew up the sled and held it steady while bessy seating herself tucked her furs close with little breaks of laughter then he placed himself in front ready he cried over his shoulder and ready she called back their craft quivered under them hanging an instant over the long stretch of whiteness below the level sun dazzled their eyes and the first plunge seemed to dash them down into darkness amherst heard a cry of glee behind him then all sounds were lost in the whistle of air humming by like the flight of a million arrows they had dropped below the sunset and were tearing through the clear nether twilight of the descent then with a bound the sled met the level and shot away across the meadow toward the opposite height it seemed to amherst as though his body had been left behind and only the spirit in him rode the wild blue currents of galloping air but as the sleds rush began to slacken with the strain of the last ascent he was recalled to himself by the touch of the breathing warmth at his back bessy had put out a hand to steady herself and as she leaned forward gripping his arm a flying end of her furs swept his face there was a delicious pang in being thus caught back to life and as the sled stopped and he sprang to his feet he still glowed with the sensation bessy too was under the spell in the dusk of the beechgrove where they had landed he could barely distinguish her features but her eyes shone on him and he heard her quick breathing as he stooped to help her to her feet oh how beautiful its the only thing better than a good gallop she leaned against a treebole panting a little and loosening her furs what a pity its too dark to begin again she sighed looking about her through the dim weaving of leafless boughs its not so dark in the open we might have one more he proposed but she shook her head seized by a new whim its so still and delicious in here did you hear the snow fall when that squirrel jumped across to the pine she tilted her head narrowing her lids as she peered upward there he is one gets used to the light look see his little eyes shining down at us as amherst looked where she pointed the squirrel leapt to another tree and they stole on after him through the hushed wood guided by his grey flashes in the dimness here and there in a break of the snow they trod on a bed of wet leaves that gave out a breath of hidden life or a hemlock twig dashed its spicy scent into their faces as they grew used to the twilight their eyes began to distinguish countless delicate gradations of tint cold mottlings of greyblack boles against the snow wet russets of drifted beechleaves a distant network of mauve twigs melting into the woodland haze and in the silence just such fine gradations of sound became audible the soft drop of loosened snowlumps a stir of startled wings the creak of a dead branch somewhere far off in darkness they walked on still in silence as though they had entered the glade of an enchanted forest and were powerless to turn back or to break the hush with a word they made no pretense of following the squirrel any longer he had flashed away to a high treetop from which his ironical chatter pattered down on their unheeding ears amhersts sensations were not of that highest order of happiness where mind and heart mingle their elements in the strong draught of life it was a languid fume that stole through him from the cup at his lips but after the sense of defeat and failure which the last weeks had brought the reaction was too exquisite to be analyzed all he asked of the moment was its immediate sweetness they had reached the brink of a rocky glen where a little brook still sent its thread of sound through mufflings of ice and huddled branches bessy stood still a moment bending her head to the sweet cold tinkle then she moved away and said slowly we must go back as they turned to retrace their steps a yellow line of light through the treetrunks showed them that they had not after all gone very deep into the wood a few minutes walk would restore them to the lingering daylight and on the farther side of the meadow stood the sleigh which was to carry bessy back to hanaford a sudden sense of the evanescence of the moment roused amherst from his absorption before the next change in the fading light he would be back again among the ugly realities of life did she too hate to return to them or why else did she walk so slowly why did she seem as much afraid as himself to break the silence that held them in its magic circle a dead pinebranch caught in the edge of her skirt and she stood still while amherst bent down to release her as she turned to help him he looked up with a smile the wood doesnt want to let you go he said she made no reply and he added rising but youll come back to it youll come back often i hope he could not see her face in the dimness but her voice trembled a little as she answered i will do what you tell me but i shall be alone against all the others they dont understand the simplicity the helplessness of the avowal appealed to him not as a weakness but as a grace he understood what she was really saying how can you desert me how can you put this great responsibility on me and then leave me to bear it alone and in the light of her unuttered appeal his action seemed almost like cruelty why had he opened her eyes to wrongs she had no strength to redress without his aid he could only answer as he walked beside her toward the edge of the wood you will not be alone in time you will make the others understand in time they will be with you ah you dont believe that she exclaimed pausing suddenly and speaking with an intensity of reproach that amazed him i hope it at any rate he rejoined pausing also and im sure that if you will come here oftener if youll really live among your people how can you say that when youre deserting them she broke in with a feminine excess of inconsequence that fairly dashed the words from his lips deserting them dont you understand i understand that youve made mr gaines and truscomb angry yes but if i should insist on your staying amherst felt the blood rush to his forehead no no its not possible he exclaimed with a vehemence addressed more to himself than to her then what will happen at the mills oh some one else will be found the new ideas are stirring everywhere and if youll only come back here and help my successor do you think they are likely to choose any one else with your ideas she interposed with unexpected acuteness and after a short silence he answered not immediately perhaps but in time in time there will be improvements as if the poor people could wait oh its cruel cruel of you to go her voice broke in a throb of entreaty that went to his inmost fibres you dont understand its impossible in the present state of things that i should do any good by staying then you refuse even if i were to insist on their asking you to stay you would still refuse she persisted yes i should still refuse she made no answer but moved a few steps nearer to the edge of the wood the meadow was just below them now and the sleigh in plain sight on the height beyond their steps made no sound on the sodden drifts underfoot and in the silence he thought he heard a catch in her breathing it was enough to make the brimming moment overflow he stood still before her and bent his head to hers bessy he said with sudden vehemence she did not speak or move but in the quickened state of his perceptions he became aware that she was silently weeping the gathering darkness under the trees enveloped them it absorbed her outline into the shadowy background of the wood from which her face emerged in a faint spot of pallor and the same obscurity seemed to envelop his faculties merging the hard facts of life in a blur of feeling in which the distinctest impression was the sweet sense of her tears bessy he exclaimed again and as he drew a step nearer he felt her yield to him and bury her sobs against his arm book ii ix but justine mrs harry dressel seated in the june freshness of her oak street drawingroom and harmonizing by her high lights and hard edges with the whiteandgold angularities of the best furniture cast a rebuking eye on her friend miss brent who stood arranging in a glass bowl the handful of roses she had just brought in from the garden mrs dressels intonation made it clear that the entrance of miss brent had been the signal for renewing an argument which the latter had perhaps left the room to escape when you were here three years ago justine i could understand your not wanting to go out because you were in mourning for your mother and besides youd volunteered for that bad surgical case in the hope hospital but now that youve come back for a rest and a change i cant imagine why you persist in shutting yourself up unless of course she concluded in a higher key of reproach its because you think so little of hanaford society justine brent putting the last rose in place turned from her task with a protesting gesture my dear effie who am i to think little of any society when i belong to none she passed a last light touch over the flowers and crossing the room brushed her friends hand with the same caressing gesture mrs dressel met it with an unrelenting turn of her plump shoulder murmuring oh if you take that tone and on miss brents gaily rejoining isnt it better than to have other people take it for me she replied with an air of affront that expressed itself in a ruffling of her whole pretty person if youll excuse my saying so justine the fact that you are staying with me would be enough to make you welcome anywhere in hanaford im sure of it dear so sure that my horrid pride rather resents being floated in on the high tide of such overwhelming credentials mrs dressel glanced up doubtfully at the dark face laughing down on her though she was president of the maplewood avenue bookclub and habitually figured in the society column of the banner as one of the intellectual leaders of hanaford there were moments when her selfconfidence trembled before justines light sallies it was absurd of course given the relative situations of the two and mrs dressel behind her friends back was quickly reassured by the thought that justine was only a hospital nurse who had to work for her living and had really never been anywhere but when miss brents verbal arrows were flying it seemed somehow of more immediate consequence that she was fairly wellconnected and lived in new york no one placed a higher value on the abstract qualities of wit and irony than mrs dressel the difficulty was that she never quite knew when justines retorts were loaded or when her own susceptibilities were the target aimed at and between her desire to appear to take the joke and the fear of being ridiculed without knowing it her pretty face often presented an interesting study in perplexity as usual she now took refuge in bringing the talk back to a personal issue i cant imagine she said why you wont go to the gainess gardenparty its always the most brilliant affair of the season and this year with the john amhersts here and all their party that fascinating mrs eustace ansell and mrs amhersts father old mr langhope who is quite as quick and clever as you are you certainly cant accuse us of being dull and provincial miss brent smiled as far as i can remember effie it is always you who accuse others of bringing that charge against hanaford for my part i know too little of it to have formed any opinion but whatever it may have to offer me i am painfully conscious of having at present nothing but your kind commendation to give in return mrs dressel rose impatiently how absurdly you talk youre a little thinner than usual and i dont like those dark lines under your eyes but westy gaines told me yesterday that he thought you handsomer than ever and that it was intensely becoming to some women to look overtired its lucky im one of that kind miss brent rejoined between a sigh and a laugh and theres every promise of my getting handsomer every day if somebody doesnt soon arrest the geometrical progression of my good looks by giving me the chance to take a years rest as she spoke she stretched her arms above her head with a gesture revealing the suppleness of her slim young frame but also its tenuity of structure the frailness of throat and shoulders and the play of bones in the delicate neck justine brent had one of those imponderable bodies that seem a mere pinch of matter shot through with light and colour though she did not flush easily auroral lights ran under her clear skin were lost in the shadows of her hair and broke again in her eyes and her voice seemed to shoot light too as though her smile flashed back from her words as they fell all her features being so fluid and changeful that the one solid thing about her was the massing of dense black hair which clasped her face like the noble metal of some antique bust mrs dressels face softened at the note of weariness in the girls voice are you very tired dear she asked drawing her down to a seat on the sofa yes and no not so much bodily perhaps as in spirit justine brent drew her brows together and stared moodily at the thin brown hands interwoven between mrs dressels plump fingers seated thus with hollowed shoulders and brooding head she might have figured a young sibyl bowed above some mystery of fate but the next moment her face inclining toward her friends cast off its shadows and resumed the look of a plaintive child the worst of it is that i dont look forward with any interest to taking up the old drudgery again of course that loss of interest may be merely physical i should call it so in a nervous patient no doubt but in myself it seems different it seems to go to the roots of the world you know it was always the imaginative side of my work that helped me over the ugly details the pity and beauty that disinfected the physical horror but now that feeling is lost and only the mortal disgust remains oh effie i dont want to be a ministering angel any more i want to be uncertain coy and hard to please i want something dazzling and unaccountable to happen to me something new and unlived and indescribable she snatched herself with a laugh from the bewildered effie and flinging up her arms again spun on a light heel across the polished floor well then murmured mrs dressel with gentle obstinacy i cant see why in the world you wont go to the gainess gardenparty and caught in the whirlwind of her friends incomprehensible mirth she still persisted as she ducked her blonde head to it if youll only let me lend you my dress with the irish lace youll look smarter than anybody there before her toilet mirror an hour later justine brent seemed in a way to fulfill mrs dressels prediction so mirrorlike herself she could no more help reflecting the happy effect of a bow or a feather than the subtler influence of word and look and her face and figure were so new to the advantages of dress that at fourandtwenty she still produced the effect of a young girl in her first good frock in mrs dressels festal raiment which her dark tints subdued to a quiet elegance she was like the golden core of a pale rose illuminating and scenting its petals three years of solitary life following on a youth of confidential intimacy with the mother she had lost had produced in her the quaint habit of halfloud soliloquy fine feathers justine she laughed back at her laughing image you look like a phoenix risen from your ashes but slip back into your own plumage and youll be no more than a little brown bird without a song the luxurious suggestions of her dress and the way her warm youth became it drew her back to memories of a childhood nestled in beauty and gentle ways before her handsome prodigal father had died and her mothers face had grown pinched in the long struggle with poverty but those memories were after all less dear to justine than the grey years following when growing up she had helped to clear a space in the wilderness for their tiny hearthfire when her own efforts had fed the flame and roofed it in from the weather a great heat kindled at that hearth had burned in her veins making her devour her work lighting and warming the long cold days and reddening the horizon through dark passages of revolt and failure and she felt all the more deeply the chill of reaction that set in with her mothers death she thought she had chosen her work as a nurse in a spirit of high disinterestedness but in the first hours of her bereavement it seemed as though only the personal aim had sustained her for a while after this her sick people became to her mere bundles of disintegrating matter and she shrank from physical pain with a distaste the deeper because mechanically she could not help working on to relieve it gradually her sound nature passed out of this morbid phase and she took up her task with deeper pity if less exalted ardour glad to do her part in the vast impersonal labour of easing the worlds misery but longing with all the warm instincts of youth for a special load to lift a single hand to clasp ah it was cruel to be alive to be young to bubble with springs of mirth and tenderness and folly and to live in perpetual contact with decay and pain to look persistently into the grey face of death without having lifted even a corner of lifes veil now and then when she felt her youth flame through the sheath of dullness which was gradually enclosing it she rebelled at the conditions that tied a spirit like hers to its monotonous task while others without a quiver of wings on their dull shoulders or a note of music in their hearts had the whole wide world to range through and saw in it no more than a frightful emptiness to be shut out with tight walls of habit a tap on the door announced mrs dressel garbed for conquest and bestowing on her brilliant person the last anxious touches of the artist reluctant to part from a masterpiece my dear how well you look i knew that dress would be becoming she exclaimed generously transferring her selfapproval to justine and adding as the latter moved toward her i wish westy gaines could see you now well he will presently miss brent rejoined ignoring the slight stress on the name mrs dressel continued to brood on her maternally justine i wish youd tell me you say you hate the life youre leading now but isnt there somebody who might give me another with lace dresses in it justines slight shrug might have seemed theatrical had it not been a part of the ceaseless dramatic play of her flexible person there might be perhapsonly im not sure she broke off whimsically not sure of what that this kind of dress might not always be a little tight on the shoulders tight on the shoulders what do you mean justine my clothes simply hang on you oh effie dear dont you remember the fable of the wings under the skin that sprout when one meets a pair of kindred shoulders and as mrs dressel bent on her a brow of unenlightenment well it doesnt matter i only meant that ive always been afraid good clothes might keep my wings from sprouting she turned back to the glass giving herself a last light touch such as she had bestowed on the roses and that reminds me she continued how about mr amhersts wings john amherst mrs dressel brightened into immediate attention why do you know him not as the owner of the westmore mills but i came across him as their assistant manager three years ago at the hope hospital and he was starting a very promising pair then i wonder if theyre doing as well under his new coat im not sure that i understand you when you talk poetry said mrs dressel with less interest but personally i cant say i like john amherst and he is certainly not worthy of such a lovely woman as mrs westmore of course she would never let any one see that shes not perfectly happy but im told he has given them all a great deal of trouble by interfering in the management of the mills and his manner is so cold and sarcastic the truth is i suppose hes never quite at ease in society her family have never been really reconciled to the marriage and westy gaines says ah westy gaines would justine interposed lightly but if mrs amherst is really the bessy langhope i used to know it must be rather a struggle for the wings mrs dressels flagging interest settled on the one glimpse of fact in this statement its such a coincidence that you should have known her too was she always so perfectly fascinating i wish i knew how she gives that look to her hair justine gathered up the lace sunshade and long gloves which her friend had lent her there was not much more that was genuine about her character that was her very own i mean than there is about my appearance at this moment she was always the dearest little chameleon in the world taking everybodys colour in the most flattering way and giving back i must say a most charming reflection if youll excuse the mixed metaphor but when one got her by herself with no reflections to catch one found she hadnt any particular colour of her own one of the girls used to say she ought to wear a tag because she was so easily mislaid now then im ready justine advanced to the door and mrs dressel followed her downstairs reflecting with pardonable complacency that one of the disadvantages of being clever was that it tempted one to say sarcastic things of other women than which she could imagine no more crying social error during the drive to the gardenparty justines thoughts drawn to the past by the mention of bessy langhopes name reverted to the comic inconsequences of her own lot to that persistent irrelevance of incident that had once made her compare herself to an actor always playing his part before the wrong stagesetting was there not for instance a mocking incongruity in the fact that a creature so leaping with life should have for chief outlet the narrow mental channel of the excellent couple between whom she was now being borne to the gaines gardenparty all her friendships were the result of propinquity or of early association and fate had held her imprisoned in a circle of welltodo mediocrity peopled by just such figures as those of the kindly and prosperous dressels effie dressel the daughter of a cousin of mrs brents had obscurely but safely allied herself with the heavy blond young man who was to succeed his father as president of the union bank and who was already regarded by the solid business interests of hanaford as possessing talents likely to carry him far in the development of the paternal fortunes harry dressels honest countenance gave no evidence of peculiar astuteness and he was in fact rather the product of special conditions than of an irresistible bent he had the sound saxon love of games and the most interesting game he had ever been taught was business he was a simple domestic being and according to hanaford standards the most obvious obligation of the husband and father was to make his family richer if harry dressel had ever formulated his aims he might have said that he wanted to be the man whom hanaford most respected and that was only another way of saying the richest man in hanaford effie embraced his creed with a zeal facilitated by such evidence of its soundness as a growing income and the early prospects of a carriage her motherinlaw a kind old lady with a simple unquestioning love of money had told her on her wedding day that harrys one object would always be to make his family proud of him and the recent purchase of the victoria in which justine and the dressels were now seated was regarded by the family as a striking fulfillment of this prophecy in the course of her hospital work justine had of necessity run across far different types but from the connections thus offered she was often held back by the subtler shades of taste that civilize human intercourse her world in short had been chiefly peopled by the dull or the crude and hemmed in between the two she had created for herself an inner kingdom where the fastidiousness she had to set aside in her outward relations recovered its full sway there must be actual beings worthy of admission to this secret precinct but hitherto they had not come her way and the sense that they were somewhere just out of reach still gave an edge of youthful curiosity to each encounter with a new group of people certainly mrs gainess gardenparty seemed an unlikely field for the exercise of such curiosity justines few glimpses of hanaford society had revealed it as rather a dull thick body with a surface stimulated only by illadvised references to the life of larger capitals and the concentrated essence of social hanaford was of course to be found at the gaines entertainments it presented itself however in the rich june afternoon on the long shadows of the wellkept lawn and among the paths of the rosegarden in its most amiable aspect and to justine wearied by habitual contact with ugliness and suffering there was pure delight in the verdant setting of the picture and in the light harmonious tints of the figures peopling it if the company was dull it was at least decorative and poverty misery and dirt were shut out by the placid unconsciousness of the guests as securely as by the leafy barriers of the garden x ah mrs dressel we were on the lookout for you waiting for the curtain to rise your friend miss brent juliana mrs dressels friend miss brent near the brilliantlystriped marquee that formed the axis of the gaines gardenparties mr halford gaines a few paces from his wife and daughters stood radiating a royal welcome on the stream of visitors pouring across the lawn it was only to eyes perverted by a different social perspective that there could be any doubt as to the importance of the gaines entertainments to hanaford itself they were epochmaking and if any rebellious spirit had cherished a doubt of the fact it would have been quelled by the official majesty of mr gainess frockcoat and the comprehensive cordiality of his manner there were moments when new york hung like a disquieting cloud on the social horizon of mrs gaines and her daughters but to halford gaines hanaford was all in all as an exponent of the popular and patriotic goodenoughforme theory he stood in high favour at the hanaford club where a tookeen consciousness of the metropolis was alternately combated by easy allusion and studied omission and where the unsettled fancies of youth were chastened and steadied by the reflection that if hanaford was good enough for halford gaines it must offer opportunities commensurate with the largest ideas of life never did mr gainess manner bear richer witness to what could be extracted from hanaford than when he was in the act of applying to it the powerful pressure of his hospitality the resultant essence was so bubbling with social exhilaration that to its producer at any rate its somewhat mixed ingredients were lost in one highly flavoured draught under ordinary circumstances no one discriminated more keenly than mr gaines between different shades of social importance but any one who was entertained by him was momentarily ennobled by the fact and not all the anxious telegraphy of his wife and daughters could for instance recall to him that the striking young woman in mrs dressels wake was only some obscure protр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср ррірсрўср в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв

seen our roses oh there are other roses in hanaford miss brent i dont mean to imply that no one else attempts them but unless you can afford to give carte blanche to your man and mine happens to be something of a specialistwell if youll come with me ill let them speak for themselves i always say that if people want to know what we can do they must come and see theyll never find out from me a more emphatic signal from his wife arrested mr gaines as he was in the act of leading miss brent away eh what the amhersts and mrs ansell you must excuse me then im afraid but westy shall take you westy my boy its an illwind i want you to show this young lady our roses and mr gaines with mingled reluctance and satisfaction turned away to receive the most important guests of the day it had not needed his fathers summons to draw the expert westy to miss brent he was already gravitating toward her with the nonchalance bred of cosmopolitan successes but with a directness of aim due also to his larger opportunities of comparison the roses will do he explained as he guided her through the increasing circle of guests about his mother and in answer to justines glance of enquiry to get you away i mean theyre not much in themselves you know but everything of the governors always begins with a capital letter oh but these roses deserve to justine exclaimed as they paused under the evergreen archway at the farther end of the lawn i dont know not if youve been in england westy murmured watching furtively for the impression produced on one who had presumably not by the great blush of colour massed against its dusky background of clipped evergreens justine smiled i have been but ive been in the slums since in horrible places that the least of those flowers would have lighted up like a lamp westys guarded glance imprudently softened its the beastliest kind of a shame your ever having had to do such work oh had to she flashed back at him disconcertingly it was my choice you know there was a time when i couldnt live without it philanthropy is one of the subtlest forms of selfindulgence westy met this with a vague laugh if a chap who was as knowing as the devil did once in a way indulge himself in the luxury of talking recklessly to a girl with exceptional eyes it was rather upsetting to discover in those eyes no consciousness of the risk he had taken but i am rather tired of it now she continued and his look grew guarded again after all they were all the same except in that particular matter of the eyes at the thought he risked another look hung on the sharp edge of betrayal and was snatched back not by the manly instinct of selfpreservation but by some imp of mockery lurking in the depths that lured him he recovered his balance and took refuge in a tone of worldly ease i saw a chap the other day who said he knew you when you were at saint elizabeths wasnt that the name of your hospital justine assented one of the doctors i suppose where did you meet him ah now she should see he summoned his utmost carelessness of tone down on long island last week i was spending sunday with the amhersts he held up the glittering fact to her and watched for the least little blink of awe but her lids never trembled it was a confession of social blindness which painfully negatived mrs dressels hint that she knew the amhersts if she had even known of them she could not so fatally have missed his point long island she drew her brows together in puzzled retrospection i wonder if it could have been stephen wyant i heard he had taken over his uncles practice somewhere near new york wyant thats the name hes the doctor at clifton the nearest town to the amhersts place little cicely had a cold cicely westmore you know a small cousin of mine by the way he switched a rosebranch loftily out of her path explaining as she moved on that cicely was the daughter of mrs amhersts first marriage to richard westmore thats the way i happened to see this dr wyant bessy mrs amherst asked him to stop to luncheon after hed seen the kid he seems rather a discontented sort of a chap grumbling at not having a new york practice i should have thought he had rather a snug berth down there at lynbrook with all those swells to dose justine smiled dr wyant is ambitious and swells dont have as interesting diseases as poor people one gets tired of giving them bread pills for imaginary ailments but dr wyant is not strong himself and i fancy a country practice is better for him than hard work in town you think him clever though do you westy enquired absently he was already bored with the subject of the long island doctor and vexed at the lack of perception that led his companion to show more concern in the fortunes of a country practitioner than in the fact of his own visit to the amhersts but the topic was a safe one and it was agreeable to see how her face kindled when she was interested justine mused on his question i think he has very great promise which he is almost certain not to fulfill she answered with a sigh which seemed to westys anxious ear to betray a more than professional interest in the person referred to oh come now why not with the amhersts to give him a start i heard my cousin recommending him to a lot of people the other day oh he may become a fashionable doctor justine assented indifferently to which her companion rejoined with a puzzled stare thats just what i mean with bessy backing him has mrs amherst become such a power then justine asked taking up the coveted theme just as he despaired of attracting her to it my cousin he stretched the two syllables to the crackingpoint well shes awfully rich you know and theres nobody smarter dont you think so i dont know its so long since ive seen her he brightened you did know her then but the discovery made her obtuseness the more inexplicable oh centuries ago in another world centuries i like that westy gallantly protested his ardour kindling as she swam once more within his social ken and amherst you know him too i suppose by jove here he is now he signalled a tall figure strolling slowly toward them with bent head and brooding gaze justines eye had retained a vivid image of the man with whom scarcely three years earlier she had lived through a moment of such poignant intimacy and she recognized at once his lean outline and the keen spring of his features still veiled by the same look of inward absorption she noticed as he raised his hat in response to westy gainess greeting that the vertical lines between his brows had deepened and a moment later she was aware that this change was the visible token of others which went deeper than the fact of his good clothes and his general air of leisure and wellbeing changes perceptible to her only in the startled sense of how prosperity had aged him hallo amherst trying to get under cover westy jovially accosted him with a significant gesture toward the crowded lawn from which the newcomer had evidently fled i was just telling miss brent that this is the safest place on these painful occasions oh confound it its not as safe as i thought heres one of my sisters making for me there ensued a short conflict of words before his feeble flutter of resistance was borne down by a resolute miss gaines who as she swept him back to the marquee cried out to amherst that her mother was asking for him too and then justine had time to observe that her remaining companion had no intention of responding to his hostesss appeal westy in naming her had laid just enough stress on the name to let it serve as a reminder or an introduction as circumstances might decide and she saw that amherst roused from his abstraction by the proffered clue was holding his hand out doubtfully i think we havent met for some years he said justine smiled i have a better reason than you for remembering the exact date and in response to his look of surprise she added you made me commit a professional breach of faith and ive never known since whether to be glad or sorry amherst still bent on her the gaze which seemed to find in external details an obstacle rather than a help to recognition but suddenly his face cleared it was you who told me the truth about poor dillon i couldnt imagine why i seemed to see you in such a different setting oh im disguised as a lady this afternoon she said smiling but im glad you saw through the disguise he smiled back at her are you why it seems to make it if its so transparent less of a sham less of a dishonesty she began impulsively and then paused again a little annoyed at the overemphasis of her words why was she explaining and excusing herself to this stranger did she propose to tell him next that she had borrowed her dress from effie dressel to cover her confusion she went on with a slight laugh but you havent told me what was i to tell you whether to be glad or sorry that i broke my vow and told the truth about dillon they were standing face to face in the solitude of the gardenwalk forgetful of everything but the sudden surprised sense of intimacy that had marked their former brief communion justine had raised her eyes halflaughingly to amherst but they dropped before the unexpected seriousness of his why do you want to know he asked she made an effort to sustain the note of pleasantry well it might for instance determine my future conduct you see im still a nurse and such problems are always likely to present themselves ah then dont dont i mean he hesitated a moment reaching up to break a rose from the branch that tapped his shoulder i was only thinking what risks we run when we scramble into the chariot of the gods and try to do the driving be passive be passive and youll be happier oh as to that she swept it aside with one of her airy motions but dillon for instance would he have been happier if id been passive amherst seemed to ponder there again how can one tell and the risks not worth taking no she paused and they looked at each other again do you mean that seriously i wonder do you act on it myself god forbid the gods drive so badly theres poor dillonhe happened to be in their wayas we all are at times he pulled himself up and went on in a matteroffact tone in dillons case however my axioms dont apply when my wife heard the truth she was of course immensely kind to him and if it hadnt been for you she might never have known justine smiled i think you would have found out i was only the humble instrument but now she hesitated now you must be able to do so much amherst lifted his head and she saw the colour rise under his fair skin out at westmore youve never been there since yes my wife has made some changes but its all so problematic and one would have to live here you dont then he answered by an imperceptible shrug of course im here often and she comes now and then but the journeys tiresome and it is not always easy for her to get away he checked himself and justine saw that he in turn was suddenly conscious of the incongruity of explaining and extenuating his personal situation to a stranger but then were not strangers a voice in her exulted just as he added with an embarrassed attempt to efface and yet justify his moment of expansion that reminds me i think you know my wife i heard her asking mrs dressel about you she wants so much to see you the transition had been effected at the expense of dramatic interest but to the obvious triumph of social observances and to justine after all regaining at his side the group about the marquee the interest was not so much diminished as shifted to the no less suggestive problem of studying the friend of her youth in the unexpected character of john amhersts wife meanwhile however during the brief transit across the gaines greensward her thoughts were still busy with amherst she had seen at once that the peculiar sense of intimacy reawakened by their meeting had been chilled and deflected by her first allusion to the topic which had previously brought them together amherst had drawn back as soon as she named the mills what could be the cause of his reluctance when they had last met the subject burned within him her being in actual fact a stranger had not then been an obstacle to his confidences now that he was master at westmore it was plain that another tone became him that his situation necessitated a greater reserve but her enquiry did not imply the least wish to overstep this restriction it merely showed her remembrance of his franklyavowed interest in the operatives justine was struck by the fact that so natural an allusion should put him on the defensive she did not for a moment believe that he had lost his interest in the mills and that his point of view should have shifted with the fact of ownership she rejected as an equally superficial reading of his character the man with whom she had talked at dillons bedside was one in whom the ruling purposes had already shaped themselves and to whom life in whatever form it came must henceforth take their mould as she reached this point in her analysis it occurred to her that his shrinking from the subject might well imply not indifference but a deeper preoccupation a preoccupation for some reason suppressed and almost disavowed yet sustaining the more intensely its painful hidden life from this inference it was but a leap of thought to the next that the cause of the change must be sought outside of himself in some external influence strong enough to modify the innate lines of his character and where could such an influence be more obviously sought than in the marriage which had transformed the assistant manager of the westmore mills not indeed into their owner that would rather have tended to simplify the problem but into the husband of mrs westmore after all the mills were bessys and for a farther understanding of the case it remained to find out what manner of person bessy had become justines first impression as her friends charming arms received her with an eagerness of welcome not lost on the suspended judgment of feminine hanaford the immediate impression was of a gain of emphasis of individuality as though the fluid creature she remembered had belied her prediction and run at last into a definite mould yes bessy had acquired an outline a graceful one as became her early promise though with perhaps a little more sharpness of edge than her youthful texture had promised but the side she turned to her friend was still all softness had in it a hint of the old pliancy the impulse to lean and enlace that at once woke in justine the corresponding instinct of guidance and protection so that their first kiss before a word was spoken carried the two back to the precise relation in which their schooldays had left them so easy a reversion to the past left no room for the sense of subsequent changes by which such reunions are sometimes embarrassed justines sympathies had instinctively and almost at once transferred themselves to bessys side passing over at a leap the pained recognition that there were sides already and bessy had gathered up justine into the circle of gentle selfabsorption which left her very dimly aware of any distinctive characteristic in her friends except that of their affection for herself since she asked only as she appealingly put it that they should all be dreadfully fond of her and ive wanted you so often justine youre the only clever person im not afraid of because your cleverness always used to make things clear instead of confusing them ive asked so many people about you but i never heard a word till just the other day wasnt it odd when our new doctor at rushton happened to say that he knew you ive been rather unwell lately nervous and tired and sleeping badly and he told me i ought to keep perfectly quiet and be under the care of a nurse who could make me do as she chose just such a nurse as a wonderful miss brent he had known at st elizabeths whose patients obeyed her as if shed been the colonel of a regiment his description made me laugh it reminded me so much of the way you used to make me do what you wanted at the convent and then it suddenly occurred to me that i had heard of you having gone in for nursing and we compared notes and i found it was really you wasnt it odd that we should discover each other in that way i daresay we might have passed in the street and never known it im sure i must be horribly changed thus bessy discoursed in the semiisolation to which under an overarching beechtree the discretion of their hostess had allowed the two friends to withdraw for the freer exchange of confidences there was at first sight nothing in her aspect to bear out mrs amhersts plaintive allusion to her health but justine who knew that she had lost a baby a few months previously assumed that the effect of this shock still lingered though evidently mitigated by a reviving interest in pretty clothes and the other ornamental accessories of life certainly bessy amherst had grown into the full loveliness which her childhood promised she had the kind of finished prettiness that declares itself early holds its own through the awkward transitions of girlhood and resists the strain of all later vicissitudes as though miraculously preserved in some clear medium impenetrable to the wear and tear of living you absurd child youve not changed a bit except to grow more so justine laughed paying amused tribute to the childish craving for a compliment that still betrayed itself in bessys eyes well you have then justine youve grown extraordinarily handsome that is extraordinary of me certainly the other acknowledged gaily but then think what room for improvement there was and how much time ive had to improve in it is a long time isnt it bessy assented i feel so intimate still with the old justine of the convent and i dont know the new one a bit just think ive a great girl of my own almost as old as we were when we went to the sacred heart but perhaps you dont know anything about me either you see i married again two years ago and my poor baby died last marchso i have only cicely it was such a disappointment i wanted a boy dreadfully and i understand little babies so much better than a big girl like cicely oh dear here is juliana gaines bringing up some more tiresome people its such a bore but john says i must know them all well thank goodness weve only one more day in this dreadful place and of course i shall see you dear before we go xi after conducting miss brent to his wife john amherst by the exercise of considerable strategic skill had once more contrived to detach himself from the throng on the lawn and regaining a path in the shrubbery had taken refuge on the verandah of the house here under the shade of the awning two ladies were seated in a seclusion agreeably tempered by the distant strains of the hanaford band and by the shifting prospect of the groups below them ah here he is now the younger of the two exclaimed turning on amherst the smile of intelligence that mrs eustace ansell was in the habit of substituting for the idle preliminaries of conversation we were not talking of you though she added as amherst took the seat to which his mother beckoned him but of bessy which i suppose is almost as indiscreet she added the last phrase after an imperceptible pause and as if in deprecation of the hardly more perceptible frown which at the mention of his wifes name had deepened the lines between amhersts brows indiscreet of his own mother and his wifes friend mrs amherst protested laying her trimlygloved hand on her sons arm while the latter with his eyes on her companion said slowly mrs ansell knows that indiscretion is the last fault of which her friends are likely to accuse her raison de plus you mean she laughed meeting squarely the challenge that passed between them under mrs amhersts puzzled gaze well if i take advantage of my reputation for discretion to meddle a little now and then at least i do so in a good cause i was just saying how much i wish that you would take bessy to europe and i am so sure of my cause in this case that i am going to leave it to your mother to give you my reasons she rose as she spoke not with any sign of haste or embarrassment but as if gracefully recognizing the desire of mother and son to be alone together but amherst rising also made a motion to detain her no one else will be able to put your reasons half so convincingly he said with a slight smile and i am sure my mother would much rather be spared the attempt mrs ansell met the smile as freely as she had met the challenge my dear lucy she rejoined laying as she reseated herself a light caress on mrs amhersts hand im sorry to be flattered at your expense but its not in human nature to resist such an appeal you see she added raising her eyes to amherst how sure i am of myself and of you when youve heard me oh john is always ready to hear one his mother murmured innocently well i dont know that i shall even ask him to do as much as that im so sure after all that my suggestion carries its explanation with it there was a moments pause during which amherst let his eyes wander absently over the dissolving groups on the lawn the suggestion that i should take bessy to europe he paused again when next autumn no now at once on a long honeymoon he frowned slightly at the last word passing it by to revert to the direct answer to his question at once no i cant see that the suggestion carries its explanation with it mrs ansell looked at him hesitatingly she was conscious of the illchosen word that still reverberated between them and the unwonted sense of having blundered made her for the moment less completely mistress of herself ah youll see farther presently she rose again unfurling her lace sunshade as if to give a touch of definiteness to her action its not after all she added with a sweet frankness a case for argument and still less for persuasion my reasons are excellent i should insist on putting them to you myself if they were not but theyre so good that i can leave you to find them out and to back them up with your own which will probably be a great deal better she summed up with a light nod which included both amherst and his mother and turning to descend the verandah steps waved a signal to mr langhope who was limping disconsolately toward the house what has she been saying to you mother amherst asked returning to his seat beside his mother mrs amherst replied by a shake of her head and a raised forefinger of reproval now johnny i wont answer a single question till you smooth out those lines between your eyes her son relaxed his frown to smile back at her well dear there have to be some wrinkles in every family and as you absolutely refuse to take your share his eyes rested affectionately on the frosty sparkle of her charming old face which had in its setting of recovered prosperity the freshness of a sunny winter morning when the very snow gives out a suggestion of warmth he remembered how on the evening of his dismissal from the mills he had paused on the threshold of their sittingroom to watch her a moment in the lamplight and had thought with bitter compunction of the fresh wrinkle he was about to add to the lines about her eyes the three years which followed had effaced that wrinkle and veiled the others in a tardy bloom of wellbeing from the moment of turning her back on westmore and establishing herself in the pretty little house at hanaford which her sons wife had placed at her disposal mrs amherst had shed all traces of the difficult years and the fact that his marriage had enabled him to set free before it was too late the pentup springs of her youthfulness sometimes seemed to amherst the clearest gain in his lifes confused total of profit and loss it was at any rate the sense of bessys share in the change that softened his voice when he spoke of her to his mother now then if i present a sufficiently unruffled surface let us go back to mrs ansell for i confess that her mysterious reasons are not yet apparent to me mrs amherst looked deprecatingly at her son maria ansell is devoted to you too john of course she is its her rр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср

to take bessy abroad she and mr langhope think that bessy is not looking well amherst paused and the frown showed itself for a moment what do you think mother i hadnt noticed it myself bessy seems to me prettier than ever but perhaps she has less colour and she complains of not sleeping maria thinks she still frets over the baby amherst made an impatient gesture is europe the only panacea you should consider john that bessy is used to change and amusement i think you sometimes forget that other people havent your faculty of absorbing themselves in a single interest and maria says that the new doctor at clifton whom they seem to think so clever is very anxious that bessy should go to europe this summer no doubt and so is every one else i mean her father and old tredegar and your friend mrs ansell not least mrs amherst lifted her bright black eyes to his well then if they all think she needs it good heavens if travel were what she needed why weve never stopped travelling since we married weve been everywhere on the globe except at hanaford this is her second visit here in three years he rose and took a rapid turn across the deserted verandah its not because her health requires it its to get me away from westmore to prevent things being done there that ought to be done he broke out vehemently halting again before his mother the aged pink faded from mrs amhersts face but her eyes retained their lively glitter to prevent things being done what a strange thing to say i shouldnt have said it if i hadnt seen you falling under mrs ansells spell his mother had a gesture which showed from whom he had inherited his impulsive movements really my son she folded her hands and added after a pause of selfrecovery if you mean that i have ever attempted to interfere no no but when they pervert things so damnably john he dropped into his chair again and pushed the hair from his forehead with a groan well then put it that they have as much right to their view as i have i only want you to see what it is whenever i try to do anything at westmore to give a real start to the work that bessy and i planned together some pretext is found to stop it to pack us off to the ends of the earth to cry out against reducing her income to encourage her in some new extravagance to which the work at the mills must be sacrificed mrs amherst growing pale under this outbreak assured herself by a nervous backward glance that their privacy was still uninvaded then her eyes returned to her sons face john are you sure youre not sacrificing your wife to the mills he grew pale in turn and they looked at each other for a moment without speaking you see it as they do then he rejoined with a discouraged sigh i see it as any old woman would who had my experiences to look back to mother he exclaimed she smiled composedly do you think i mean that as a reproach thats because men will never understand women least of all sons their mothers no real mother wants to come first she puts her sons career ahead of everything but its different with a wife and a wife as much in love as bessy amherst looked away i should have thought that was a reason that would reconcile her to being set aside to counting only second in your plans they were her plans when we married ah my dear she paused on that letting her shrewd old glance and all the delicate lines of experience in her face supply what farther comment the ineptitude of his argument invited he took the full measure of her meaning receiving it in a baffled silence that continued as she rose and gathered her lace mantle about her as if to signify that their confidences could not on such an occasion be farther prolonged without singularity then he stood up also and joined her resting his hand on hers while she leaned on the verandah rail poor mother and ive kept you to myself all this time and spoiled your good afternoon no dear i was a little tired and had slipped away to be quiet she paused and then went on persuasively giving back his pressure i know how you feel about doing your duty john but now that things are so comfortably settled isnt it a pity to unsettle them amherst had intended on leaving his mother to rejoin bessy whom he could still discern on the lawn in absorbed communion with miss brent but after what had passed it seemed impossible for the moment to recover the gardenparty tone and he made his escape through the house while a trio of cuban singers who formed the crowning number of the entertainment gathered the company in a denser circle about their guitars as he walked on aimlessly under the deep june shadows of maplewood avenue his mothers last words formed an ironical accompaniment to his thoughts now that things are comfortably settled he knew so well what that elastic epithet covered himself for instance ensconced in the impenetrable prosperity of his wonderful marriage herself too unconsciously dear soul so happily tucked away in a cranny of that new and spacious life and no more able to conceive why existing conditions should be disturbed than the bird in the eaves understands why the house should be torn down well he had learned at last what his experience with his poor valiant puzzled mother might have taught him that one must never ask from women any view but the personal one any measure of conduct but that of their own pains and pleasures she indeed had borne undauntedly enough the brunt of their earlier trials but that was merely because as she said the mothers instinct bade her heap all her private hopes on the great devouring altar of her sons ambition it was not because she had ever in the very least understood or sympathized with his aims and bessy perhaps if their little son had lived she might in turn have obeyed the worldold instinct of selfeffacement but now he remembered with an intenser selfderision that not even in the first surprise of his passion had he deluded himself with the idea that bessy westmore was an exception to her sex he had argued rather that being only a lovelier product of the common mould she would abound in the adaptabilities and pliancies which the lords of the earth have seen fit to cultivate in their companions she would care for his aims because they were his during their precipitate wooing and through the first brief months of marriage this profound and original theory had been gratifyingly confirmed then its perfect surface had begun to show a flaw amherst had always conveniently supposed that the poets line summed up the good womans rule of ethics he for god only she for god in him it was for the god in him surely that she had loved him for that first glimpse of an ampler ether a diviner air that he had brought into her cramped and curtained life he could never now evoke that earlier delusion without feeling on its stilltender surface the keen edge of mrs ansells smile she no doubt could have told him at any time why bessy had married him it was for his beaux yeux as mrs ansell would have put it because he was young handsome persecuted an ardent lover if not a subtle one because bessy had met him at the fatal moment because her family had opposed the marriage because in brief the gods that day may have been a little short of amusement well they were having their laugh out now there were moments when high heaven seemed to ring with it with these thoughts at his heels amherst strode on overtaken now and again by the wheels of departing guests from the gardenparty and knowing as they passed him what was in their minds envy of his success admiration of his cleverness in achieving it and a little halfcontemptuous pity for his wife who with her wealth and looks might have done so much better certainly if the case could have been put to hanaford the hanaford of the gaines gardenparty it would have sided with bessy to a voice and how much justice was there in what he felt would have been the unanimous verdict of her class was his mother right in hinting that he was sacrificing bessy to the mills but the mills were bessy at least he had thought so when he married her they were her particular form of contact with life the expression of her relation to her fellowmen her pretext her opportunity unless they were merely a vast purse in which to plunge for her pinmoney he had fancied it would rest with him to determine from which of these standpoints she should view westmore and at the outset she had enthusiastically viewed it from his in her eager adoption of his ideas she had made a pet of the mills organizing the mothers club laying out a recreationground on the hopewood property and playing with pretty plans in watercolour for the emergency hospital and the building which was to contain the nightschools library and gymnasium but even these minor projects which he had urged her to take up as a means of learning their essential dependence on his larger scheme were soon to be set aside by obstacles of a material order bessy always wanted money not a great deal but as she reasonably put it enough and who was to blame if her father and mr tredegar each in his different capacity felt obliged to point out that every philanthropic outlay at westmore must entail a corresponding reduction in her income perhaps if she could have been oftener at hanaford these arguments would have been counteracted for she was tenderhearted and prompt to relieve such suffering as she saw about her but her imagination was not active and it was easy for her to forget painful sights when they were not under her eye this was perhaps halfconsciously one of the reasons why she avoided hanaford why as amherst exclaimed they had been everywhere since their marriage but to the place where their obligations called them there had at any rate always been some good excuse for not returning there and consequently for postponing the work of improvement which it was generally felt her husband could not fitly begin till she had returned and gone over the ground with him after their marriage and especially in view of the comment excited by that romantic incident it was impossible not to yield to her wish that they should go abroad for a few months then before her confinement the doctors had exacted that she should be spared all fatigue and worry and after the babys death amherst had felt with her too tenderly to venture an immediate return to unwelcome questions for by this time it had become clear to him that such questions were and always would be unwelcome to her as the easiest means of escaping them she had once more dismissed the whole problem to the vague and tiresome sphere of business whence he had succeeded in detaching it for a moment in the early days of their union her first husband poor unappreciated westmore had always spared her the boredom of business and halford gaines and mr tredegar were ready to show her the same consideration it was part of the modern code of chivalry that lovely woman should not be bothered about ways and means but bessy was too much the wife and the wife in love to consent that her husbands views on the management of the mills should be totally disregarded precisely because her advisers looked unfavourably on his intervention she felt bound if only in defense of her illusions to maintain and emphasize it the mills were in fact the official

policy of conciliating the opposing influences which had so uncomfortably chosen to fight out their case on the field of her poor little existence theoretically siding with her husband but surreptitiously as he well knew giving aid and comfort to the enemy who were really defending her own cause all this amherst saw with that cruel insight which had replaced his former blindness he was in truth more ashamed of the insight than of the blindness it seemed to him horribly coldblooded to be thus analyzing after two years of marriage the source of his wifes inconsistencies and partly for this reason he had put off from month to month the final question of the future management of the mills and of the radical changes to be made there if his system were to prevail but the time had come when if bessy had to turn to westmore for the justification of her marriage he had even more need of calling upon it for the same service he had not assuredly married her because of westmore but he would scarcely have contemplated marriage with a rich woman unless the source of her wealth had offered him some such opportunity as westmore presented his special training and the natural bent of his mind qualified him in what had once seemed a predestined manner to help bessy to use her power nobly for her own uplifting as well as for that of westmore and so the mills became incongruously enough the plank of safety to which both clung in their sense of impending disaster it was not that amherst feared the temptation to idleness if this outlet for his activity were cut off he had long since found that the luxury with which his wife surrounded him merely quickened his natural bent for hard work and hard fare he recalled with a touch of bitterness how he had once regretted having separated himself from his mothers class and how seductive for a moment to both mind and senses that other life had appeared well he knew it now and it had neither charm nor peril for him capua must have been a dull place to one who had once drunk the joy of battle what he dreaded was not that he should learn to love the life of ease but that he should grow to loathe it uncontrollably as the symbol of his mental and spiritual bondage and westmore was his safetyvalve his refuge if he were cut off from westmore what remained to him it was not only the work he had found to his hand but the one work for which his hand was fitted it was his life that he was fighting for in insisting that now at last before the close of this longdeferred visit to hanaford the question of the mills should be faced and settled he had made that clear to bessy in a scene he still shrank from recalling for it was of the essence of his somewhat unbending integrity that he would not trick her into a confused surrender to the personal influence he still possessed over her but must seek to convince her by the tedious process of argument and exposition against which she knew no defense but tears and petulance but he had at any rate gained her consent to his setting forth his views at the meeting of directors the next morning and meanwhile he had meant to be extraordinarily patient and reasonable with her till the hint of mrs ansells stratagem produced in him a fresh reaction of distrust xii that evening when dinner ended mrs ansell with a glance through the tall diningroom windows had suggested to bessy that it would be pleasanter to take coffee on the verandah but amherst detained his wife with a glance i should like bessy to stay he said the diningroom being on the cool side the house with a refreshing outlook on the garden the men preferred to smoke there rather than in the stuffilydraped oriental apartment destined to such rites and bessy amherst with a faint sigh sank back into her seat while mrs ansell drifted out through one of the open windows the men surrounding richard westmores table were the same who nearly three years earlier had gathered in his house for the same purpose the discussion of conditions at the mills the only perceptible change in the relation to each other of the persons composing this group was that john amherst was now the host of the other two instead of being a subordinate called in for crossexamination but he was so indifferent or at least so heedless a host so forgetful for instance of mr tredegars preference for a light cigar and of mr langhopes feelings on the duty of making the westmore madeira circulate with the sun that the change was manifest only in his eveningdress and in the fact of his sitting at the foot of the table if amherst was conscious of the contrast thus implied it was only as a restriction on his freedom as far as the welfare of westmore was concerned he would rather have stood before his companions as the assistant manager of the mills than as the husband of their owner and it seemed to him as he looked back that he had done very little with the opportunity which looked so great in the light of his present restrictions what he had done with it the use to which as unfriendly critics might insinuate he had so adroitly put it had landed him ironically enough in the ugly impasse of a situation from which no issue seemed possible without some wasteful sacrifice of feeling his wifes feelings for example were already revealing themselves in an impatient play of her fan that made her father presently lean forward to suggest if we men are to talk shop is it necessary to keep bessy in this hot room amherst rose and opened the window behind his wifes chair theres a breeze from the west the room will be cooler now he said returning to his seat oh i dont mind bessy murmured in a tone intended to give her companions the full measure of what she was being called on to endure mr tredegar coughed slightly

the cigarlighter which flamed unheeded at amhersts elbow what special purpose will be served by a preliminary review of the questions to be discussed tomorrow ah exactly murmured mr langhope the madeira my dear john no ah please to the left amherst impatiently reversed the direction in which he had set the precious vessel moving and turned to mr tredegar who was conspicuously lighting his cigar with a match extracted from his waistcoat pocket the purpose is to define my position in the matter and i prefer that bessy should do this with your help rather than with mine mr tredegar surveyed his cigar through drooping lids as though the question propounded by amherst were perched on its tip is not your position naturally involved in and defined by hers you will excuse my saying that technically speaking of course i cannot distinctly conceive of it as having any separate existence mr tredegar spoke with the deliberate mildness that was regarded as his most effective weapon at the bar since it was likely to abash those who were too intelligent to be propitiated by it certainly it is involved in hers amherst agreed but how far that defines it is just what i have waited till now to find out bessy at this point recalled her presence by a restless turn of her graceful person and her father with an affectionate glance at her interposed amicably but surely according to oldfashioned ideas it implies identity of interests yes but whose interests amherst asked why your wifes man she owns the mills amherst hesitated i would rather talk of my wifes interest in the mills than of her interests there but well keep to the plural if you prefer it personally i believe the terms should be interchangeable in the conduct of such a business ah im glad to hear that said mr tredegar quickly since its precisely the view we all take amhersts colour rose definitions are ambiguous he said before you adopt mine perhaps i had better develop it a little farther what i mean is that bessys interests in westmore should be regulated by her interest in it in its welfare as a social body aside from its success as a commercial enterprise if we agree on this definition we are at one as to the other namely that my relation to the matter is defined by hers he paused a moment as if to give his wife time to contribute some sign of assent and encouragement but she maintained a puzzled silence and he went on there is nothing new in this i have tried to make bessy understand from the beginning what obligations i thought the ownership of westmore entailed and how i hoped to help her fulfill them but ever since our marriage all definite discussion of the subject has been put off for one cause or another and that is my reason for urging that it should be brought up at the directors meeting tomorrow there was another pause during which bessy glanced tentatively at mr tredegar and then said with a lovely rise of colour but john i sometimes think you forget how much has been done at westmore the mothers club and the playground and all in the way of carrying out your ideas mr tredegar discreetly dropped his glance to his cigar and mr langhope sounded an irrepressible note of approval and encouragement amherst smiled no i have not forgotten and i am grateful to you for giving my ideas a trial but what has been done hitherto is purely superficial bessys eyes clouded and he added hastily dont think i undervalue it for that reason heaven knows the surface of life needs improving but its like picking flowers and sticking them in the ground to make a garden unless you transplant the flower with its roots and prepare the soil to receive it your garden will be faded tomorrow no radical changes have yet been made at westmore and it is of radical changes that i want to speak bessys look grew more pained and mr langhope exclaimed with unwonted irascibility upon my soul amherst the tone you take about what your wife has done doesnt strike me as the likeliest way of encouraging her to do more i dont want to encourage her to do more on such a basis the sooner she sees the futility of it the better for westmore the futility bessy broke out with a flutter of tears in her voice but before her father could intervene mr tredegar had raised his hand with the gesture of one accustomed to wield the gavel my dear child i see amhersts point and it is best as he says that you should see it too what he desires as i understand it is the complete reconstruction of the present state of things at westmore and he is right in saying that all your good works there nightschools and nursery and so forth leave that issue untouched a smile quivered under mr langhopes moustache he and amherst both knew that mr tredegars feint of recognizing the justice of his adversarys claim was merely the first step to annihilating it but bessy could never be made to understand this and always felt herself deserted and betrayed when any side but her own was given a hearing im sorry if all i have tried to do at westmore is useless but i suppose i shall never understand business she murmured vainly seeking consolation in her fathers eye this is not business amherst broke in its the question of your personal relation to the people there the last thing that business considers mr langhope uttered an impatient exclamation i wish to heaven the owner of the mills had made it clear just what that relation was to be i think he did sir amherst answered steadily in leaving his wife the unrestricted control of the property he had reddened under mr langhopes thrust but his voice betrayed no irritation and bessy rewarded him with an unexpected beam of sympathy she was always up in arms at the least sign of his being treated as an intruder i am sure papa she said a little tremulously that poor richard though he knew i was not clever felt he could trust me to take the best advice ah thats all we ask of you my child her father sighed while mr tredegar drily interposed we are merely losing time by this digression let me suggest that amherst should give us an idea of the changes he wishes to make at westmore amherst as he turned to answer remembered with what ardent faith in his powers of persuasion he had responded to the same appeal three years earlier he had thought then that all his cause needed was a hearing now he knew that the practical mans readiness to let the idealist talk corresponds with the busy parents permission to destructive infancy to run out and play they would let him state his case to the four corners of the earth if only he did not expect them to act on it it was their policy to let him exhaust himself in argument and exhortation to listen to him so politely and patiently that if he failed to enforce his ideas it should not be for lack of opportunity to expound them and the alternative struck him as hardly less to be feared supposing that the incredible happened that his reasons prevailed with his wife and through her with the others at what cost would the victory be won would bessy ever forgive him for winning it and what would his situation be if it left him in control of westmore but estranged from his wife he recalled suddenly a phrase he had used that afternoon to the darkeyed girl at the gardenparty what risks we run when we scramble into the chariot of the gods and at the same instant he heard her retort and saw her fine gesture of defiance how could he ever have doubted that the thing was worth doing at whatever cost something in him some secret lurking element of weakness and evasion shrank out of sight in the light of her question do you act on that and the god forbid he had instantly flashed back to her he turned to mr tredegar with his answer amherst knew that any large theoretical exposition of the case would be as much wasted on the two men as on his wife to gain his point he must take only one step at a time and it seemed to him that the first thing needed at westmore was that the hands should work and live under healthier conditions to attain this two important changes were necessary the floorspace of the mills must be enlarged and the company must cease to rent out tenements and give the operatives the opportunity to buy land for themselves both these changes involved the upheaval of the existing order whenever the westmore mills had been enlarged it had been for the sole purpose of increasing the revenues of the company and now amherst asked that these revenues should be materially and permanently reduced as to the suppression of the company tenement such a measure struck at the roots of the baneful paternalism which was choking out every germ of initiative in the workman once the operatives had room to work in and the hope of homes of their own to go to when work was over amherst was willing to trust to time for the satisfaction of their other needs he believed that a sounder understanding of these needs would develop on both sides the moment the employers proved their good faith by the deliberate and permanent sacrifice of excessive gain to the wellbeing of the employed and once the two had learned to regard each other not as antagonists but as collaborators a long step would have been taken toward a readjustment of the whole industrial relation in regard to general and distant results amherst tried not to be too sanguine even in his own thoughts his aim was to remedy the abuse nearest at hand in the hope of thus getting gradually closer to the central evil and had his action been unhampered he would still have preferred the longer and more circuitous path of practical experiment to the sweeping adoption of a new industrial system but his demands moderate as they were assumed in his hearers the consciousness of a moral claim superior to the obligation of making ones business pay and it was the futility of this assumption that chilled the arguments on his lips since in the orthodox creed of the business world it was a weakness and not a strength to be content with five per cent where ten was obtainable business was one thing philanthropy another and the enthusiasts who tried combining them were usually reduced after a brief flight to paying fifty cents on the dollar and handing over their stock to a promoter presumably unhampered by humanitarian ideals amherst knew that this was the answer with which his plea would be met knew moreover that the plea was given a hearing simply because his judges deemed it so pitiably easy to refute but the knowledge once he had begun to speak fanned his argument to a white heat of pleading since with failure so plainly ahead small concessions and compromises were not worth making reason would be wasted on all but eloquence might at least prevail with bessy when late that night he went upstairs after long pacings of the garden he was surprised to see a light in her room she was not given to midnight study and fearing that she might be ill he knocked at her door there was no answer and after a short pause he turned the handle and entered in the great canopied westmore couch her arms flung upward and her hands clasped beneath her head she lay staring fretfully at the globe of electric light which hung from the centre of the embossed and gilded ceiling seen thus with the soft curves of throat and arms revealed and her face childishly set in a cloud of loosened hair she looked no older than cicely and like cicely inaccessible to grownup arguments and the stronger logic of experience it was a trick of hers in such moods to ignore any attempt to attract her notice and amherst was prepared for her remaining motionless as he paused on the threshold and then advanced toward the middle of the room there had been a time when he would have been exasperated by her pretense of not seeing him but a deep weariness of spirit now dulled him to these surface pricks i was afraid you were not well when i saw the light burning he began thank you i am quite well she answered in a colourless voice without turning her head shall i put it out then you cant sleep with such a glare in your eyes i should not sleep at any rate and i hate to lie awake in the dark why shouldnt you sleep he moved nearer looking down compassionately on her perturbed face and struggling lips she lay silent a moment then she faltered out b because im so unhappy the pretense of indifference was swept away by a gush of childish sobs as she flung over on her side and buried her face in the embroidered pillows amherst bending down laid a quieting hand on her shoulder bessy she sobbed on he seated himself silently in the armchair beside the bed and kept his soothing hold on her shoulder the time had come when he went through all these accustomed acts of pacification as mechanically as a nurse soothing a fretful child and once he had thought her weeping eloquent he looked about him at the spacious room with its heavy hangings of damask and the thick velvet carpet which stifled his steps everywhere were the graceful tokens of her presence the vast lacedraped toilettable strewn with silver and crystal the embroidered muslin cushions heaped on the lounge the little roselined slippers she had just put off the lace wrapper with a scent of violets in its folds which he had pushed aside when he sat down beside her and he remembered how full of a mysterious and intimate charm these things had once appeared to him it was characteristic that the remembrance made him more patient with her now perhaps after all it was his failure that she was crying over dont be unhappy you decided as seemed best to you he said she pressed her handkerchief against her lips still keeping her head averted but i hate all these arguments and disputes why should you unsettle everything she murmured his mothers words involuntarily he removed his hand from her shoulder though he still remained seated by the bed you are right i see the uselessness of it he assented with an uncontrollable note of irony she turned her head at the tone and fixed her plaintive brimming eyes on him you are angry with me was that troubling you he leaned forward again with compassion in his face sancta simplicitas was the thought within him i am not angry he went on be reasonable and try to sleep she started upright the light masses of her hair floating about her like silken seaweed lifted on an invisible tide dont talk like that i cant endure to be humoured like a baby i am unhappy because i cant see why all these wretched questions should be dragged into our life i hate to have you always disagreeing with mr tredegar who is so clever and has so much experience and yet i hate to see you give way to him because that makes it appear as ifas if he didnt care a straw for my ideas amherst smiled well he doesnt and i never dreamed of making him so dont worry about that either you never dreamed of making him care for your ideas but then why do you why do i go on setting them forth at such great length amherst smiled again to convince you thats my only ambition she stared at him shaking her head back to toss a loose lock from her puzzled eyes a tear still shone on her lashes but with the motion it fell and trembled down her cheek to convince me but you know i am so ignorant of such things most women are i never pretended to understand anything about economics or whatever you call it no then how he turned and looked at her gently i thought you might have begun to understand something about me about you the colour flowered softly under her clear skin about what my ideas on such subjects were likely to be worth judging from what you know of me in other respects he paused and glanced away from her well he concluded deliberately i suppose ive had my answer tonight oh john he rose and wandered across the room pausing a moment to finger absently the trinkets on the dressingtable the act recalled with a curious vividness certain dulled sensations of their first days together when to handle and examine these frail little accessories of her toilet had been part of the wonder and amusement of his new existence he could still hear her laugh as she leaned over him watching his mystified look in the glass till their reflected eyes met there and drew down her lips to his he laid down the fragrant powderpuff he had been turning slowly between his fingers and moved back toward the bed in the interval he had reached a decision well isnt it natural that i should think so he began again as he stood beside her when we married i never expected you to care or know much about economics it isnt a quality a man usually chooses his wife for but i had a fancy perhaps it shows my conceit that when we had lived together a year or two and youd found out what kind of a fellow i was in other ways ways any woman can judge of i had a fancy that you might take my opinions on faith when it came to my own special business the thing im generally supposed to know about he knew that he was touching a sensitive chord for bessy had to the full her sexs pride of possessorship he was human and faulty till others criticized him then he became a god but in this case a conflicting influence restrained her from complete response to his appeal i do feel sure you know about the treatment of the hands and all that but you said yourself once the first time we ever talked about westmore that the business part was different here it was again the ancient ineradicable belief in the separable body and soul even an industrial organization was supposed to be subject to the old theological distinction and bessy was ready to cooperate with her husband in the emancipation of westmores spiritual part if only its body remained under the law amherst controlled his impatience as it was always easy for him to do when he had fixed on a definite line of conduct it was my situation that was different not what you call the business part that is inextricably bound up with the treatment of the hands if i am to have anything to do with the mills now i can deal with them only as your representative and as such i am bound to take in the whole question bessys face clouded was he going into it all again but he read her look and went on reassuringly that was what i meant by saying that i hoped you would take me on faith if i want the welfare of westmore its above all i believe because i want westmore to see you as i do as the dispenser of happiness who could not endure to benefit by any wrong or injustice to others of course of course i dont want to do them injustice well then he had seated himself beside her again clasping in his the hand with which she was fretting the laceedged sheet he felt her restless fingers surrender slowly and her eyes turned to him in appeal but i care for what people say of you too and you know its horrid but one must consider it if they say youre spending my money imprudently the blood rose to her neck and face i dont mind for myselfeven if i have to give up as many things as papa and mr tredegar thinkbut there is cicelyand if people said if people said i was spending cicelys money on improving the condition of the people to whose work she will some day owe all her wealth amherst paused well i would rather hear that said of me than any other thing i can think of except one except what that i was doing it with her mothers help and approval she drew a long tremulous sigh he knew it was always a relief to her to have him assert himself strongly but a residue of resistance still clouded her mind i should always want to help you of course but if mr tredegar and halford gaines think your plan unbusinesslike mr tredegar and halford gaines are certain to think it so and that is why i said just now that it comes in the end to your choosing between us taking them on experience or taking me on faith she looked at him wistfully of course i should expect to give up things you wouldnt want me to live here i should not ask you to he said halfsmiling i suppose there would be a good many things we couldnt do you would certainly have less money for a number of years after that i believe you would have more rather than less but i should not want you to think that beyond a reasonable point the prosperity of the mills was ever to be measured by your dividends no she leaned back wearily among the pillows i suppose for instance we should have to give up europe this summer here at last was the bottom of her thought it was always on the immediate pleasure that her soul hung she had not enough imagination to look beyond even in the projecting of her own desires and it was on his knowledge of this limitation that amherst had deliberately built i dont see how you could go to europe he said the doctor thinks i need it she faltered in that case of course he stood up not abruptly or with any show of irritation but as if accepting this as her final answer what you need most in the meantime is a little sleep he said i will tell your maid not to disturb you in the morning he had returned to his soothing way of speech as though definitely resigned to the inutility of farther argument and i will say goodbye now he continued because i shall probably take an early train before you wake she sat up with a start an early train why where are you going i must go to chicago some time this month and as i shall not be wanted here tomorrow i might as well run out there at once and join you next week at lynbrook bessy had grown pale but i dont understand their eyes met cant you understand that i am human enough to prefer under the circumstances not being present at tomorrows meeting he said with a dry laugh she sank back with a moan of discouragement turning her face away as he began to move toward his room shall i put the light out he asked pausing with his hand on the electric button yes please he pushed in the button and walked on guided through the obscurity by the line of light under his door as he reached the threshold he heard a little choking cry john oh john he paused i cant bear it the sobs increased bear what that you should hate me dont be foolish he said groping for his doorhandle but you do hate me and i deserve it nonsense dear try to sleep i cant sleep till youve forgiven me say you dont hate me ill do anythingonly say you dont hate me he stood still a moment thinking then he turned back and made his way across the room to her side as he sat down beside her he felt her arms reach for his neck and her wet face press itself against his cheek ill do anything she sobbed and in the darkness he held her to him and hated his victory xiii mrs ansell was engaged in what she called picking up threads she had been abroad for the summer had in fact transferred herself but a few hours earlier from her returning steamer to the little station at lynbrook and was now in the bright september afternoon which left her in sole possession of the terrace of lynbrook house using that pleasant eminence as a point of observation from which to gather up some of the loose ends of history dropped at her departure it might have been thought that the actual scene outspread below her the descending gardens the tenniscourts the farmlands sloping away to the blue sealike shimmer of the hempstead plains offered at the moment little material for her purpose but that was to view them with a superficial eye mrs ansells trained gaze was for example greatly enlightened by the fact that the tenniscourts were fringed by a group of people indolently watchful of the figures agitating themselves about the nets and that as she turned her head toward the entrance avenue the receding view of a station omnibus followed by a luggagecart announced that more guests were to be added to those who had almost taxed to its limits the expansibility of the luncheontable all this to the initiated eye was full of suggestion but its significance was as nothing to that presented by the approach of two figures which as mrs ansell watched detached themselves from the cluster about the tennisground and struck obliquely and at a desultory pace across the lawn toward the terrace the figures those of a slight young man with stooping shoulders and of a lady equally youthful but slenderly erect moved forward in absorbed communion as if unconscious of their surroundings and indefinite as to their direction till on the brink of the wide grass terrace just below their observers parapet they paused a moment and faced each other in closer speech this interchange of words though brief in measure of time lasted long enough to add a vivid strand to mrs ansells thickening skein then on a gesture of the ladys and without signs of formal leavetaking the young man struck into a path which regained the entrance avenue while his companion quickening her pace crossed the grass terrace and mounted the wide stone steps sweeping up to the house these brought her out on the upper terrace a few yards from mrs ansells post and exposed her unprepared to the full beam of welcome which that ladys rapid advance threw like a searchlight across her path dear miss brent i was just wondering how it was that i hadnt seen you before mrs ansell as she spoke drew the girls hand into a long soft clasp which served to keep them confronted while she delicately groped for whatever thread the encounter seemed to proffer justine made no attempt to evade the scrutiny to which she found herself exposed she merely released her hand by a movement instinctively evasive of the mechanical endearment explaining with a smile that softened the gesture i was out with cicely when you arrived weve just come in the dear child i havent seen her either mrs ansell continued to bestow upon the speakers clear dark face an intensity of attention in which for the moment cicely had no perceptible share i hear you are teaching her botany and all kinds of wonderful things justine smiled again i am trying to teach her to wonder that is the hardest faculty to cultivate in the modern child yes i suppose so in myself mrs ansell admitted with a responsive brightness i find it develops with age the world is a remarkable place she threw this off absently as though leaving miss brent to apply it either to the inorganic phenomena with which cicely was supposed to be occupied or to those subtler manifestations that engaged her own attention its a great thing she continued for bessy to have had your help for cicely and for herself too there is so much that i want you to tell me about her as an old friend i want the benefit of your fresher eye about bessy justine hesitated letting her glance drift to the distant group still anchored about the tennisnets dont you find her looking better than when i left so much so that i was unduly disturbed just now by seeing that clever little doctor it was he wasnt it who came up the lawn with you dr wyant yes miss brent hesitated again but he merely called with a message not professionally tant mieux the truth is i was anxious about bessy when i left i thought she ought to have gone abroad for a change but as it turns out her little excursion with you did as well i think she only needed rest perhaps her six weeks in the adirondacks were better than europe ah under your care that made them better mrs ansell in turn hesitated the lines of her face melting and changing as if a rapid stagehand had shifted them when she spoke again they were as open as a public square but also as destitute of personal significance as flat and smooth as the painted drop before the real scene it hides i have always thought that bessy for all her health and activity needs as much care as cicely the kind of care a clever friend can give she is so wasteful of her strength and her nerves and so unwilling to listen to reason poor dick westmore watched over her as if she were a baby but perhaps mr amherst who must have been used to such a different type of woman doesnt realizeand then hes so little here the drop was lit up by a smile that seemed to make it more impenetrable as an old friend i cant help telling you how much i hope she is to have you with her for a long time a long long time miss brent bent her head in slight acknowledgment of the tribute oh soon she will not need any care my dear miss brent she will always need it mrs ansell made a movement inviting the young girl to share the bench from which at the latters approach she had risen but perhaps there is not enough in such a life to satisfy your professional energies she seated herself and after an imperceptible pause justine sank into the seat beside her i am very glad just now to give my energies a holiday she said leaning back with a little sigh of retrospective weariness you are tired too bessy wrote me you had been quite used up by a trying case after we saw you at hanaford miss brent smiled when a nurse is fit for work she calls a trying case a beautiful one but meanwhile mrs ansell shone on her with eldersisterly solicitude meanwhile why not stay on with cicely above all with bessy surely shes a beautiful case too isnt she justine laughingly agreed and if you want to be tried mrs ansell swept the scene with a slight lift of her philosophic shoulders youll find there are trials enough everywhere her companion started up with a glance at the small watch on her breast one of them is that its already after four and that i must see that tea is sent down to the tennisground and the new arrivals looked after i saw the omnibus on its way to the station are many more people coming five or six i believe the house is usually full for sunday mrs ansell made a slight motion to detain her and when is mr amherst expected miss brents pale cheek seemed to take on a darker tone of ivory and her glance dropped from her companions face to the vivid stretch of gardens at their feet bessy has not told me she said ah the older woman rejoined looking also toward the gardens as if to intercept miss brents glance in its flight the latter stood still a moment with the appearance of not wishing to evade whatever else her companion might have to say then she moved away entering the house by one window just as mr langhope emerged from it by another the sound of his stick tapping across the bricks roused mrs ansell from her musings but she showed her sense of his presence simply by returning to the bench she had just left and accepting this mute invitation mr langhope crossed the terrace and seated himself at her side when he had done so they continued to look at each other without speaking after the manner of old friends possessed of occult means of communication and as the result of this inward colloquy mr langhope at length said well what do you make of it what do you she rejoined turning full upon him a face so released from its usual defences and disguises that it looked at once older and more simple than the countenance she presented to the world mr langhope waved a deprecating hand i want your fresher impressions thats what i just now said to miss brent youve been talking to miss brent only a flying word she had to go and look after the new arrivals mr langhopes attention deepened well what did you say to her wouldnt you rather hear what she said to me he smiled a good crossexaminer always gets the answers he wants let me hear your side and i shall know hers i should say that applied only to stupid crossexaminers or to those who have stupid subjects to deal with and miss brent is not stupid you know far from it what else do you make out i make out that shes in possession here dont look startled do you dislike her heaven forbid with those eyes she has a wit of her own too and she certainly makes things easier for bessy she guards her carefully at any rate i could find out nothing about bessy about the general situation including miss brent mrs ansell smiled faintly i made one little discovery about her well shes intimate with the new doctor wyant mr langhopes interest dropped what of that i believe she knew him before i daresay its of no special importance except as giving us a possible clue to her character she strikes me as interesting and mysterious mr langhope smiled the things your imagination does for you it helps me to see that we may find miss brent useful as a friend a friend an ally she paused as if searching for a word she may restore the equilibrium mr langhopes handsome face darkened open bessys eyes to amherst damn him he said quietly mrs ansell let the imprecation pass when was he last here she asked five or six weeks ago for one night his only visit since she came back from the adirondacks what do you think his motive is he must know what he risks in losing his hold on bessy his motive with your eye for them can you ask a devouring ambition thats all havent you noticed that in all except the biggest minds ambition takes the form of wanting to command where one has had to obey amherst has been made to toe the line at westmore and now he wants truscomb yes and halford gaines too to do the same thats the secret of his servantofthepeople pose gad i believe its the whole secret of his marriage hes devouring my daughters substance to pay off an old score against the mills hell never rest till he has truscomb out and some creature of his own in command and then vogue la galр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср ррірсрўср в рв р

millhands ah my poor girl my poor girl mrs ansell mused you didnt write me that things were so bad theres been no actual quarrel she asked how can there be when the poor child does all he wants hes simply too busy to come and thank her too busy at hanaford so he says introducing the golden age at westmore its likely to be the age of copper at lynbrook mrs ansell drew a meditative breath i was thinking of that i understood that bessy would have to retrench while the changes at westmore were going on well didnt she give up europe and cable over to countermand her new motor but the life here this mob of people miss brent tells me the house is full for every weekend would you have my daughter cut off from all her friends mrs ansell met this promptly from some of the new ones at any rate have you heard who has just arrived mr langhopes hesitation showed a tinge of embarrassment im not sure some one has always just arrived well the fenton carburys then mrs ansell left it to her tone to annotate the announcement mr langhope raised his eyebrows slightly are they likely to be an exceptionally costly pleasure if youre trying to prove that i havent kept to the point i can assure you that im well within it but since the good blanche has got her divorce and married carbury wherein do they differ from other weekend automata because most divorced women marry again to be respectable mr langhope smiled faintly yes thats their punishment but it would be too dull for blanche precisely she married again to see ned bowfort ah that may yet be hers mrs ansell sighed at his perversity meanwhile shes brought him here and it is unnatural to see bessy lending herself to such combinations youre corrupted by a glimpse of the old societies here bowfort and carbury are simply hands at bridge old hands at it yes and the bridge is another point bessy never used to play for money well she may make something and offset her husbands prodigalities there again with this train de vie how on earth are both ends to meet mr langhope grown suddenly grave struck his cane resoundingly on the terrace westmore and lynbrook i dont want them to i want them to get farther and farther apart she cast on him a look of startled divination you want bessy to go on spending too much money how can i help it if it costs if what costs she stopped her eyes still wide then their glances crossed and she exclaimed if your scheme costs it is your scheme then he shrugged his shoulders again its a passive attitude ah the deepest plans are that mr langhope uttered no protest and she continued to piece her conjectures together but you expect it to lead up to something active do you want a rupture i want him brought back to his senses do you think that will bring him back to her where the devil else will he have to go mrs ansells eyes dropped toward the gardens across which desultory knots of people were straggling back from the ended tennismatch ah here they all come she said rising with a halfsigh and as she stood watching the advance of the brightlytinted groups she added slowly its ingenious but you dont understand him mr langhope stroked his moustache perhaps not he assented thoughtfully but suppose we go in before they join us i want to show you a set of ming i picked up the other day for bessy i flatter myself i do understand ming xiv justine brent her household duties discharged had gone upstairs to her room a little turret chamber projecting above the wide terrace below from which the sounds of lively intercourse now rose increasingly to her window bessy she knew would have preferred to have her remain with the party from whom these evidences of gaiety proceeded mrs amherst had grown to depend on her friends nearness she liked to feel that justines quick hand and eye were always in waiting on her impulses prompt to interpret and execute them without any exertion of her own bessy combined great zeal in the pursuit of sport a tireless passion for the saddle the golfcourse the tenniscourt with an almost oriental inertia within doors an indolence of body and brain that made her shrink from the active obligations of hospitality though she had grown to depend more and more on the distractions of a crowded house but justine though grateful and anxious to show her gratitude was unwilling to add to her other duties that of joining in the amusements of the houseparty she made no pretense of effacing herself when she thought her presence might be useful but even if she had cared for the diversions in favour at lynbrook a certain unavowed pride would have kept her from participating in them on the same footing with bessys guests she was not in the least ashamed of her position in the household but she chose that every one else should be aware of it that she should not for an instant be taken for one of the nomadic damsels who form the campfollowers of the great army of pleasure yet even on this point her sensitiveness was not exaggerated adversity has a deft hand at gathering loose strands of impulse into character and justines early contact with different phases of experience had given her a fairly clear view of life in the round what might be called a sound working topography of its relative heights and depths she was not seriously afraid of being taken for anything but what she really was and still less did she fear to become by force of propinquity and suggestion the kind of being for whom she might be temporarily taken when at bessys summons she had joined the latter at her camp in the adirondacks the transition from a fatiguing case at hanaford to a life in which sylvan freedom was artfully blent with the most studied personal luxury had come as a delicious refreshment to body and brain she was weary for the moment of ugliness pain and hard work and life seemed to recover its meaning under the aspect of a graceful leisure lynbrook also whither she had been persuaded to go with bessy at the end of their woodland cure had at first amused and interested her the big house on its spreading terraces with windows looking over bright gardens to the hazy distances of the plains seemed a haven of harmless ease and gaiety justine was sensitive to the finer graces of luxurious living to the warm lights on old pictures and bronzes the soft mingling of tints in faded rugs and panellings of timewarmed oak and the existence to which this background formed a setting seemed at first to have the same decorative qualities it was pleasant for once to be among people whose chief business was to look well and take life lightly and justines own buoyancy of nature won her immediate access among the amiable persons who peopled bessys weekend parties if they had only abounded a little more in their own line she might have succumbed to their spell but it seemed to her that they missed the poetry of their situation transacting their pleasures with the dreary method and shortness of view of a race tethered to the ledger even the verbal flexibility which had made her feel that she was in a world of freer ideas soon revealed itself as a form of flight from them in which the race was distinctly to the swift and justines phase of passive enjoyment passed with the return of her physical and mental activity she was a creature tingling with energy a little fleeting particle of the power that moves the sun and the other stars and the deadening influences of the life at lynbrook roused these tendencies to greater intensity as a suffocated person will suddenly develop abnormal strength in the struggle for air she did not indeed regret having come she was glad to be with bessy partly because of the childish friendship which had left such deep traces in her lonely heart and partly because what she had seen of her friends situation stirred in her all the impulses of sympathy and service but the idea of continuing in such a life of sinking into any of the positions of semidependence that an adroit and handsome girl may create for herself in a fashionable womans train this possibility never presented itself to justine till mrs ansell that afternoon had put it into words and to hear it was to revolt from it with all the strength of her inmost nature the thought of the future troubled her not so much materially for she had a light birdlike trust in the morrows fare but because her own tendencies seemed to have grown less clear because she could not rest in them for guidance as she had once done the renewal of bodily activity had not brought back her faith in her calling her work had lost the light of consecration she no longer felt herself predestined to nurse the sick for the rest of her life and in her inexperience she reproached herself with this instability youth and womanhood were in fact crying out in her for their individual satisfaction but instincts as deepseated protected her from even a momentary illusion as to the nature of this demand she wanted happiness and a life of her own as passionately as young fleshandblood had ever wanted them but they must come bathed in the light of imagination and penetrated by the sense of larger affinities she could not conceive of shutting herself into a little citadel of personal wellbeing while the great tides of existence rolled on unheeded outside whether they swept treasure to her feet or strewed her life with wreckage she felt even now that her place was there on the banks in sound and sight of the great current and just in proportion as the scheme of life at lynbrook succeeded in shutting out all sense of that vaster human consciousness so did its voice speak more thrillingly within her somewhere she felt but alas still out of reach was the life she longed for a life in which high chances of doing should be mated with the finer forms of enjoying but what title had she to a share in such an existence why none but her sense of what it was worth and what did that count for in a world which used all its resources to barricade itself against all its opportunities she knew there were girls who sought by what is called a good marriage an escape into the outer world of doing and thinking utilizing an empty brain and full pocket as the key to these envied fields some such chance the life at lynbrook seemed likely enough to offer one is not at justines age and with her penetration any more blind to the poise of ones head than to the turn of ones ideas but here the subtler obstacles of taste and pride intervened not even bessys transparent manoeuvrings her tender solicitude for her friends happiness could for a moment weaken justines resistance if she must marry without love and this was growing conceivable to her she must at least merge her craving for personal happiness in some view of life in harmony with hers a tap on her door interrupted these musings to one aspect of which bessy amhersts entrance seemed suddenly to give visible expression why did you run off justine you promised to be downstairs when i came back from tennis till you came back wasnt it dear justine corrected with a smile pushing her armchair forward as bessy continued to linger irresolutely in the doorway i saw that there was a fresh supply of tea in the drawingroom and i knew you would be there before the omnibus came from the station oh i was there but everybody was asking for you everybody justine gave a mocking lift to her dark eyebrows well westy gaines at any rate the moment he set foot in the house bessy declared with a laugh as she dropped into the armchair justine echoed the laugh but offered no comment on the statement which accompanied it and for a moment both women were silent bessy tilting her pretty discontented head against the back of the chair so that her eyes were on a level with those of her friend who leaned near her in the embrasure of the window i cant understand you justine you know well enough what hes come back for in order to dazzle hanaford with the fact that he has been staying at lynbrook nonsense the novelty of that has worn off hes been here three times since we came back you are admirably hospitable to your family bessy let her pretty ringed hands fall with a discouraged gesture why do you find him so much worse than than other people justines eyebrows rose again in the same capacity you speak as if i had boundless opportunities of comparison well youve dr wyant mrs amherst suddenly flung back at her justine coloured under the unexpected thrust but met her friends eyes steadily as an alternative to westy well if i were on a desert island but im not she concluded with a careless laugh bessy frowned and sighed you cant mean that of the two she paused and then went on doubtfully its because hes cleverer dr wyant justine smiled its not making an enormous claim for him oh i know westys not brilliant but stupid men are not always the hardest to live with she sighed again and turned on justine a glance charged with conjugal experience justine had sunk into the windowseat her thin hands clasping her knee in the attitude habitual to her meditative moments perhaps not she assented but i dont know that i should care for a man who made life easy i should want some one who made it interesting bessy met this with a pitying exclamation dont imagine you invented that every girl thinks it afterwards she finds out that its much pleasanter to be thought interesting herself she spoke with a bitterness that issued strangely from her lips it was this bitterness which gave her soft personality the sharp edge that justine had felt in it on the day of their meeting at hanaford the girl at first had tried to defend herself from these scarcelyveiled confidences distasteful enough in themselves and placing her if she listened in an attitude of implied disloyalty to the man under whose roof they were spoken but a precocious experience of life had taught her that emotions too strong for the nature containing them turn by some law of spiritual chemistry into a rankling poison and she had therefore resigned herself to serving as a kind of outlet for bessys pentup discontent it was not that her friends grievance appealed to her personal sympathies she had learned enough of the situation to give her moral assent unreservedly to the other side but it was characteristic of justine that where she sympathized least she sometimes pitied most like all quick spirits she was often intolerant of dulness yet when the intolerance passed it left a residue of compassion for the very incapacity at which she chafed it seemed to her that the tragic crises in wedded life usually turned on the stupidity of one of the two concerned and of the two victims of such a catastrophe she felt most for the one whose limitations had probably brought it about after all there could be no imprisonment as cruel as that of being bounded by a hard small nature not to be penetrable at all points to the shifting lights the wandering music of the world she could imagine no physical disability as cramping as that how the little parched soul in solitary confinement for life must pine and dwindle in its blind cranny of selflove to be ones self wide open to the currents of life does not always contribute to an understanding of narrower natures but in justine the personal emotions were enriched and deepened by a sense of participation in all that the world about her was doing suffering and enjoying and this sense found expression in the instinct of ministry and solace she was by nature a redresser a restorer and in her work as she had once told amherst the longing to help and direct to hasten on by personal intervention times slow and clumsy processes had often been in conflict with the restrictions imposed by her profession but she had no idle desire to probe the depths of other lives and where there seemed no hope of serving she shrank from fruitless confidences she was beginning to feel this to be the case with bessy amherst to touch the rock was not enough if there were but a few drops within it yet in this barrenness lay the pathos of the situation and after all may not the scanty spring be fed from a fuller current im not sure about that she said answering her friends last words after a deep pause of deliberation i mean about its being so pleasant to be found interesting im sure the passive part is always the dull one life has been a great deal more thrilling since we found out that we revolved about the sun instead of sitting still and fancying that all the planets were dancing attendance on us after all they were not and its rather humiliating to think how the morning stars must have laughed together about it there was no selfcomplacency in justines eagerness to help it was far easier for her to express it in action than in counsel to grope for the path with her friend than to point the way to it and when she had to speak she took refuge in figures to escape the pedantry of appearing to advise but it was not only to mrs dressel that her parables were dark and the blank look in bessys eyes soon snatched her down from the height of metaphor i mean she continued with a smile that as human nature is constituted it has got to find its real self the self to be interested in outside of what we conventionally call self the particular justine or bessy who is clamouring for her particular morsel of life you see self isnt a thing one can keep in a box bits of it keep escaping and flying off to lodge in all sorts of unexpected crannies we come across scraps of ourselves in the most unlikely places as i believe you would in westmore if youd only go back there and look for them bessys lip trembled and the colour sprang to her face but she answered with a flash of irritation why doesnt he look for me there then if he still wants to find me ah its for him to look here to find himself here justine murmured well he never comes here thats his answer he will he will only when he does let him find you find me i dont understand how can he when he never sees me im no more to him than the carpet on the floor justine smiled again well be that then the thing is to be under his feet thank you is that what you mean to marry for its not what husbands admire in one you know no justine stood up with a sense of stealing discouragement but i dont think i want to be admired ah thats because you know you are broke from the depths of the others bitterness the tone smote justine and she dropped into the seat at her friends side silently laying a hand on bessys feverishlyclasped fingers oh dont let us talk about me complained the latter from whose lips the subject was never long absent and you mustnt think i want you to marry justine not for myself i mean id so much rather keep you here i feel much less lonely when youre with me but you say you wont stay and its too dreadful to think of your going back to that dreary hospital but you know the hospitals not dreary to me justine interposed its the most interesting place ive ever known mrs amherst smiled indulgently on this extravagance a great many people go through the craze for philanthropy she began in the tone of mature experience but justine interrupted her with a laugh philanthropy im not philanthropic i dont think i ever felt inclined to do good in the abstract any more than to do ill i cant remember that i ever planned out a course of conduct in my life its only she went on with a puzzled frown as if honestly trying to analyze her motives its only that im so fatally interested in people that before i know it ive slipped into their skins and then of course if anything goes wrong with them its just as if it had gone wrong with me and i cant help trying to rescue myself from their troubles i suppose its what youd call meddling and so should i if i could only remember that the other people were not myself bessy received this with the mild tolerance of superior wisdom once safe on the tried ground of traditional authority she always felt herself justines superior thats all very well now you see the romantic side of it she said as if humouring her friends vagaries but in time youll want something else youll want a husband and children a life of your own and then youll have to be more practical its ridiculous to pretend that comfort and money dont make a difference and if you married a rich man just think what a lot of good you could do westy will be very well off and im sure hed let you endow hospitals and things think how interesting it would be to build a ward in the very hospital where youd been a nurse i read something like that in a novel the other day it was beautifully described all the nurses and doctors that the heroine had worked with were there to receive herand her little boy went about and gave toys to the crippled children if the speakers concluding instance hardly produced the effect she had intended it was perhaps only because justines attention had been arrested by the earlier part of the argument it was strange to have marriage urged on her by a woman who had twice failed to find happiness in it strange and yet how vivid a sign that even to a nature absorbed in its personal demands not happiness but completeness is the inmost craving a life of your own that was what even bessy in her obscure way felt to be best worth suffering for and how was a spirit like justines thrilling with youth and sympathy to conceive of an isolated existence as the final answer to that craving a life circumscribed by ones own poor personal consciousness would not be life at all far better the adventure of the diver than the shivering alone on the bank bessy reading encouragement in her silence returned her handclasp with an affectionate pressure you would like that justine she said secretly proud of having hit on the convincing argument to endow hospitals with your cousins money no i should want something much more exciting bessys face kindled you mean travelling abroad and i suppose new york in winter justine broke into a laugh i was thinking of your cousin himself when i spoke and to bessys disappointed cry then it is dr wyant after all she answered lightly and without resenting the challenge i dont know suppose we leave it to the oracle the oracle time his questionandanswer department is generally the most reliable in the long run she started up gently drawing bessy to her feet and just at present he reminds me that its nearly six and that you promised cicely to go and see her before you dress for dinner bessy rose obediently does he remind you of your promises too you said youd come down to dinner tonight did i justine hesitated well im coming she said smiling and kissing her friend xv when the door closed on mrs amherst a resolve which had taken shape in justines mind during their talk together made her seat herself at her writingtable where after a moments musing over her suspended pen she wrote and addressed a hurried note this business despatched she put on her hat and jacket and letter in hand passed down the corridor from her room and descended to the entrancehall below she might have consigned her missive to the postbox which conspicuously tendered its services from a table near the door but to do so would delay the letters despatch till morning and she felt a sudden impatience to see it start the tumult on the terrace had transferred itself within doors and as justine went down the stairs she heard the click of cues from the billiardroom the talk and laughter of belated bridgeplayers the movement of servants gathering up teacups and mending fires she had hoped to find the hall empty but the sight of westy gainess figure looming watchfully on the threshold of the smokingroom gave her at the last bend of the stairs a little start of annoyance he would want to know where she was going he would offer to go with her and it would take some time and not a little emphasis to make him understand that his society was not desired this was the thought that flashed through justines mind as she reached the landing but the next moment it gave way to a contradictory feeling westy gaines was not alone in the hall from under the stairway rose the voices of a group ensconced in that popular retreat about a chessboard and as justine reached the last turn of the stairs she perceived that mason winch an earnest youth with advanced views on political economy was engaged to the diversion of a circle of spectators in teaching the telfer girls chess the futility of trying to fix the spasmodic attention of this effervescent couple and their instructors grave unconsciousness of the fact constituted for the lookerson the peculiar diversion of the scene it was of course inevitable that young winch on his arrival at lynbrook should have succumbed at once to the tumultuous charms of the telfer manner which was equally attractive to inarticulate youth and to tired and talkedout middleage but that he should have perceived no resistance in their minds to the deliberative processes of the game of chess was even to the telfers themselves a source of unmitigated gaiety nothing seemed to them funnier than that any one should credit them with any mental capacity and they had inexhaustibly amusing ways of drawing out and showing off each others ignorance it was on this scene that westys appreciative eyes had been fixed till justines appearance drew them to herself he pronounced her name joyfully and moved forward to greet her but as their hands met she understood that he did not mean to press his company upon her under the eye of the lynbrook circle he was chary of marked demonstrations and even mrs amhersts approval could not at such moments bridge over the gap between himself and the object of his attentions a gaines was a gaines in the last analysis and apart from any pleasing accident of personality but what was miss brent but the transient vehicle of those graces which providence has provided for the delectation of the privileged sex these influences were visible in the temperate warmth of westys manner and in his way of keeping a backward eye on the mute interchange of comment about the chessboard at another time his embarrassment would have amused justine but the feelings stirred by her talk with bessy had not subsided and she recognized with a sting of mortification the resemblance between her view of the lynbrook set and its estimate of herself if bessys friends were negligible to her she was almost nonexistent to them and as against herself they were overwhelmingly provided with tangible means of proving their case such considerations at a given moment may prevail decisively even with a nature armed against them by insight and irony and the mere fact that westy gaines did not mean to join her and that he was withheld from doing so by the invisible pressure of the lynbrook standards had the effect of precipitating justines floating intentions if anything farther had been needed to hasten this result it would have been accomplished by the sound of footsteps which overtaking her a dozen yards from the house announced her admirers impetuous if tardy pursuit the act of dismissing him though it took but a word and was effected with a laugh left her pride quivering with a hurt the more painful because she would not acknowledge it that she should waste a moments resentment on the conduct of a person so unimportant as poor westy showed her in a flash the intrinsic falseness of her position at lynbrook she saw that to disdain the life about her had not kept her intact from it and the knowledge made her feel anew the need of some strong decentralizing influence some purifying influx of emotion and activity she had walked on quickly through the clear october twilight which was still saturated with the afterglow of a vivid sunset and a few minutes brought her to the village stretching along the turnpike beyond the lynbrook gates the new postoffice dominated the row of shabby houses and stores set disjointedly under reddening maples and its arched doorway formed the centre of lynbrooks evening intercourse justine hastening toward the knot of loungers on the threshold had no consciousness of anything outside of her own thoughts and as she mounted the steps she was surprised to see dr wyant detach himself from the group and advance to meet her may i post your letter he asked lifting his hat his gesture uncovered the closecurling hair of a small delicatelyfinished head just saved from effeminacy by the vigorous jut of heavy eyebrows meeting above full grey eyes the eyes again at first sight might have struck one as too expressive or as expressing things too purely decorative for the purposes of a young country doctor with a growing practice but this estimate was corrected by an unexpected abruptness in their owners voice and manner perhaps the final impression produced on a close observer by dr stephen wyant would have been that the contradictory qualities of which he was compounded had not yet been brought into equilibrium by the hand of time justine in reply to his question had drawn back a step slipping her letter into the breast of her jacket that is hardly worth while since it was addressed to you she answered with a slight smile as she turned to descend the postoffice steps wyant still carrying his hat and walking with quick uneven steps followed her in silence till they had passed beyond earshot of the loiterers on the threshold then in the shade of the maple boughs he pulled up and faced her youve written to say that i may come tomorrow justine hesitated yes she said at length good god you give royally he broke out pushing his hand with a nervous gesture through the thin dark curls on his forehead justine laughed with a trace of nervousness in her own tone and you talk well imperially arent you afraid to bankrupt the language what do you mean he said staring what do you mean i have merely said that i would see you tomorrow well he retorted thats enough for my happiness she sounded her light laugh again im glad to know youre so easily pleased im not but you couldnt have done a cruel thing without a struggle and since youre ready to give me my answer tomorrow i know it cant be a cruel one they had begun to walk onward as they talked but at this she halted please dont take that tone i dislike sentimentality she exclaimed with a tinge of imperiousness that was a surprise to her own ears it was not the first time in the course of her friendship with stephen wyant that she had been startled by this intervention of something within her that resisted and almost resented his homage when they were apart she was conscious only of the community of interests and sympathies that had first drawn them together why was it then since his looks were of the kind generally thought to stand a suitor in good stead that whenever they had met of late she had been subject to these rushes of obscure hostility the halfphysical halfmoral shrinking from some indefinable element in his nature against which she was constrained to defend herself by perpetual pleasantry and evasion to wyant at any rate the answer was not far to seek his pale face reflected the disdain in hers as he returned ironically a thousand pardons i know im not always in the key the key i havent yet acquired the lynbrook tone you must make allowances for my lack of opportunity the retort on justines lips dropped to silence as though his words had in fact brought an answer to her inward questioning could it be that he was right that her shrinking from him was the result of an increased sensitiveness to faults of taste that she would once have despised herself for noticing when she had first known him in her work at st elizabeths some three years earlier his excesses of manner had seemed to her merely the boyish tokens of a richness of nature not yet controlled by experience though wyant was somewhat older than herself there had always been an element of protection in her feeling for him and it was perhaps this element which formed the real ground of her liking it was at any rate uppermost as she returned with a softened gleam of mockery since you are so sure of my answer i hardly know why i should see you tomorrow you mean me to take it now he exclaimed i dont mean you to take it at all till its given above all not to take it for granted his jutting brows drew together again ah i cant

вђрвsthetic no a clean cut with the knife you forget that were not allowed to despatch hopeless cases mores the pity he flushed to the roots of his thin hair hopeless cases thats it then thats my answer they had reached the point where at the farther edge of the straggling settlement the tiled roof of the railwaystation fronted the postoffice cupola and the shriek of a whistle now reminded justine that the spot was not propitious to private talk she halted a moment before speaking i have no answer to give you now but the one in my note that ill see you tomorrow but if youre sure of knowing tomorrow you must know now their eyes met his eloquently pleading hers kind but still impenetrable if i knew now you should know too please be content with that she rejoined how can i be when a day may make such a difference when i know that every influence about you is fighting against me the words flashed a refracted light far down into the causes of her own uncertainty ah she said drawing a little away from him im not so sure that i dont like a fight is that why you wont give in he moved toward her with a despairing gesture if i let you go now youre lost to me she stood her ground facing him with a quick lift of the head if you dont let me go i certainly am she said and he drew back as if conscious of the uselessness of the struggle his submission as usual had a disarming effect on her irritation and she held out her hand come tomorrow at three she said her voice and manner suddenly seeming to give back the hope she had withheld from him he seized on her hand with an inarticulate murmur but at the same moment a louder whistle and the thunder of an approaching train reminded her of the impossibility of prolonging the scene she was ordinarily careless of appearances but while she was mrs amhersts guest she did not care to be seen romantically loitering through the twilight with stephen wyant and she freed herself with a quick goodbye he gave her a last look hesitating and imploring then in obedience to her gesture he turned away and strode off in the opposite direction as soon as he had left her she began to retrace her steps toward lynbrook house but instead of traversing the whole length of the village she passed through a turnstile in the park fencing taking a more circuitous but quieter way home she walked on slowly through the dusk wishing to give herself time to think over her conversation with wyant now that she was alone again it seemed to her that the part she had played had been both inconsistent and undignified when she had written to wyant that she would see him on the morrow she had done so with the clear understanding that she was to give at that meeting a definite answer to his offer of marriage and during her talk with bessy she had suddenly and as it seemed to her irrevocably decided that the answer should be favourable from the first days of her acquaintance with wyant she had appreciated his intelligence and had been stimulated by his zeal for his work he had remained only six months at saint elizabeths and though his feeling for her had even then been manifest it had been kept from expression by the restraint of their professional relation and by her absorption in her duties it was only when they had met again at lynbrook that she had begun to feel a personal interest in him his youthful promise seemed nearer fulfillment than she had once thought possible and the contrast he presented to the young men in bessys train was really all in his favour he had gained in strength and steadiness without losing his high flashes of enthusiasm and though even now she was not in love with him she began to feel that the union of their common interests might create a life full and useful enough to preclude the possibility of vague repinings it would at any rate take her out of the stagnant circle of her present existence and restore her to contact with the fruitful energies of life all this had seemed quite clear when she wrote her letter why then had she not made use of their chance encounter to give her answer instead of capriciously postponing it the act might have been that of a selfconscious girl in her teens but neither inexperience nor coquetry had prompted it she had merely yielded to the spirit of resistance that wyants presence had of late aroused in her and the possibility that this resistance might be due to some sense of his social defects his lack of measure and facility was so humiliating that for a moment she stood still in the path halfmeaning to turn back and overtake him as she paused she was surprised to hear a mans step behind her and the thought that it might be wyants brought about another revulsion of feeling what right had he to pursue her in this way to dog her steps even into the lynbrook grounds she was sure that his persistent attentions had already attracted the notice of bessys visitors and that he should thus force himself on her after her dismissal seemed suddenly to make their whole relation ridiculous she turned about to rebuke him and found herself face to face with john amherst xvi amherst on leaving the train at lynbrook had paused in doubt on the empty platform his return was unexpected and no carriage awaited him but he caught the signal of the village cabdrivers ready whip amherst however felt a sudden desire to postpone the moment of arrival and consigning his luggage to the cab he walked away toward the turnstile through which justine had passed in thus taking the longest way home he was yielding another point to his reluctance he knew that at that hour his wifes visitors might still be assembled in the drawingroom and he wished to avoid making his unannounced entrance among them it was not till now that he felt the embarrassment of such an arrival for some time past he had known that he ought to go back to lynbrook but he had not known how to tell bessy that he was coming lack of habit made him inexpert in the art of easy transitions and his inability to bridge over awkward gaps had often put him at a disadvantage with his wife and her friends he had not yet learned the importance of observing the forms which made up the daily ceremonial of their lives and at present there was just enough soreness between himself and bessy to make such observances more difficult than usual there had been no open estrangement but peace had been preserved at the cost of a slowly accumulated tale of grievances on both sides since amherst had won his point about the mills the danger he had foreseen had been realized his victory at westmore had been a defeat at lynbrook it would be too crude to say that his wife had made him pay for her public concession by the private disregard of his wishes and if something of this sort had actually resulted his sense of fairness told him that it was merely the natural reaction of a soft nature against the momentary strain of selfdenial at first he had been hardly aware of this consequence of his triumph the joy of being able to work his will at westmore obscured all lesser emotions and his sentiment for bessy had long since shrunk into one of those shallow pools of feeling which a sudden tide might fill but which could never again be the deep perennial spring from which his life was fed the need of remaining continuously at hanaford while the first changes were making had increased the strain of the situation he had never expected that bessy would stay there with him had perhaps at heart hardly wished it and her plan of going to the adirondacks with miss brent seemed to him a satisfactory alternative to the european trip she had renounced he felt as relieved as though some one had taken off his hands the task of amusing a restless child and he let his wife go without suspecting that the moment might be a decisive one between them but it had not occurred to bessy that any one could regard six weeks in the adirondacks as an adequate substitute for a summer abroad she felt that her sacrifice deserved recognition and personal devotion was the only form of recognition which could satisfy her she had expected amherst to join her at the camp but he did not come and when she went back to long island she did not stop to see him though hanaford lay in her way at the moment of her return the work at the mills made it impossible for him to go to lynbrook and thus the weeks drifted on without their meeting at last urged by his mother he had gone down to long island for a night but though on that occasion he had announced his coming he found the house full and the whole party except mr langhope in the act of starting off to a dinner in the neighbourhood he was of course expected to go too and bessy appeared hurt when he declared that he was too tired and preferred to remain with mr langhope but she did not suggest staying at home herself and drove off in a mood of exuberant gaiety amherst had been too busy all his life to know what intricacies of perversion a sentimental grievance may develop in an unoccupied mind and he saw in bessys act only a sign of indifference the next day she complained to him of money difficulties as though surprised that her income had been suddenly cut down and when he reminded her that she had consented of her own will to this temporary reduction she burst into tears and accused him of caring only for westmore he went away exasperated by her inconsequence and bills from lynbrook continued to pour in on him in the first days of their marriage bessy had put him in charge of her exchequer and she was too indolent and at heart perhaps too sensitive to ask him to renounce the charge it was clear to him therefore how little she was observing the spirit of their compact and his mind was tormented by the anticipation of financial embarrassments he wrote her a letter of gentle expostulation but in her answer she ignored his remonstrance and after that silence fell between them the only way to break this silence was to return to lynbrook but now that he had come back he did not know what step to take next something in the atmosphere of his wifes existence seemed to paralyze his willpower when all about her spoke a language so different from his own how could he hope to make himself heard he knew that her family and her immediate friends mr langhope the gaineses mrs ansell and mr tredegar far from being means of communication were so many sentinels ready to raise the drawbridge and drop the portcullis at his approach they were all in league to stifle the incipient feelings he had roused in bessy to push her back into the deadening routine of her former life and the only voice that might conceivably speak for him was miss brents the case which unexpectedly presented to her by one of the hope hospital physicians had detained justine at hanaford during the month of june was the means of establishing a friendship between herself and amherst they did not meet often or get to know each other very well but he saw her occasionally at his mothers and at mrs dressels and once he took her out to westmore to consult her about the emergency hospital which was to be included among the first improvements there the expedition had been memorable to both and when some two weeks later bessy wrote suggesting that she should take miss brent to the adirondacks it seemed to amherst that there was no one whom he would rather have his wife choose as her companion he was much too busy at the time to cultivate or analyze his feeling for miss brent he rested vaguely in the thought of her as of the nicest girl he had ever met and was frankly pleased when accident brought them together but the seeds left in both their minds by these chance encounters had not yet begun to germinate so unperceived had been their gradual growth in intimacy that it was a surprise to amherst to find himself suddenly thinking of her as a means of communication with his wife but the thought gave him such encouragement that when he saw justine in the path before him he went toward her with unusual eagerness justine on her part felt an equal pleasure she knew that bessy did not expect her husband and that his prolonged absence had already been the cause of malicious comment at lynbrook and she caught at the hope that this sudden return might betoken a more favourable turn of affairs oh i am so glad to see you she exclaimed and her tone had the effect of completing his reassurance his happy sense that she would understand and help him i wanted to see you too he began confusedly then conscious of the intimacy of the phrase he added with a slight laugh the fact is im a culprit looking for a peacemaker a culprit ive been so tied down at the mills that i didnt know till yesterday just when i could break away and in the hurry of leaving he paused again checked by the impossibility of uttering to the girl before him the little conventional falsehoods which formed the small currency of bessys circle not that any scruple of probity restrained him in trifling matters he recognized the usefulness of such counters in the social game but when he was with justine he always felt the obscure need of letting his real self be seen i was stupid enough not to telegraph he said and i am afraid my wife will think me negligent she often has to reproach me for my sins of omission and this time i know they are many the girl received this in silence less from embarrassment than from surprise for she had already guessed that it was as difficult for amherst to touch even lightly on his private affairs as it was instinctive with his wife to pour her grievances into any willing ear justines first thought was one of gratification that he should have spoken and of eagerness to facilitate the saying of whatever he wished to say but before she could answer he went on hastily the fact is bessy does not know how complicated the work at westmore is and when i caught sight of you just now i was thinking that you are the only one of her friends who has any technical understanding of what i am trying to do and who might consequently help her to see how hard it is for me to take my hand from the plough justine listened gravely longing to cry out her comprehension and sympathy but restrained by the sense that the moment was a critical one where impulse must not be trusted too far it was quite possible that a reaction of pride might cause amherst to repent even so guarded an avowal and if that happened he might never forgive her for having encouraged him to speak she looked up at him with a smile why not tell bessy yourself your understanding of the case is a good deal clearer than mine or any one elses oh bessy is tired of hearing about it from me and besides she detected a shade of disappointment in his tone and was sorry she had said anything which might seem meant to discourage his confidence it occurred to her also that she had been insincere in not telling him at once that she had already been let into the secret of his domestic differences she felt the same craving as amherst for absolute openness between them i know she said almost timidly that bessy has not been quite content of late to have you give so much time to westmore and perhaps she herself thinks it is because the work there does not interest her but i believe it is for a different reason what reason he asked with a look of surprise because westmore takes you from her because she thinks you are happier there than at lynbrook the day had faded so rapidly that it was no longer possible for the speakers to see each others faces and it was easier for both to communicate through the veil of deepening obscurity but good heavens she might be there with me shes as much needed there as i am amherst exclaimed yes but you must remember that its against all her habits and against the point of view of every one about her that she should lead that kind of life and meanwhile well meanwhile isnt it expedient that you should a little more lead hers always the same answer to his restless questioning his mothers answer the answer of bessy and her friends he had somehow hoped that the girl at his side would find a different solution to the problem and his disappointment escaped in a bitter exclamation but westmore is my life hers too if she knew it i cant desert it now without being as false to her as to myself as he spoke he was overcome once more by the hopelessness of trying to put his case clearly how could justine for all her quickness and sympathy understand a situation of which the deeper elements were necessarily unknown to her the advice she gave him was natural enough and on her lips it seemed not the counsel of a shallow expediency but the plea of compassion and understanding but she knew nothing of the long struggle for mutual adjustment which had culminated in this crisis between himself and his wife and she could therefore not see that if he yielded his point and gave up his work at westmore the concession would mean not renewal but destruction he felt that he should hate bessy if he won her back at that price and the violence of his feeling frightened him it was in truth as he had said his own life that he was fighting for if he gave up westmore he could not fall back on the futile activities of lynbrook and fate might yet have some lower alternative to offer he could trust to his own strength and selfcommand while his energies had a normal outlet but idleness and selfindulgence might work in him like a dangerous drug justine kept steadily to her point westmore must be foremost to both of you in time i dont see how either of you can escape that but the realization of it must come to bessy through you and for that reason i think that you ought to be more patient that you ought even to put the question aside for a time and enter a little more into her life while she is learning to understand yours as she ended it seemed to her that what she had said was trite and ineffectual and yet that it might have passed the measure of discretion and torn between two doubts she added hastily but you have done just that in coming back now that is the real solution of the problem while she spoke they passed out of the woodpath they had been following and rounding a mass of shrubbery emerged on the lawn below the terraces the long bulk of the house lay above them dark against the lingering gleam of the west with brightlylit windows marking its irregular outline and the sight produced in amherst and justine a vague sense of helplessness and constraint it was impossible to speak with the same freedom confronted by that substantial symbol of the accepted order which seemed to glare down on them in massive disdain of their puny efforts to deflect the course of events and amherst without reverting to her last words asked after a moment if his wife had many guests he listened in silence while justine ran over the list of names the telfer girls and their brother mason winch and westy gaines a cluster of young bridgeplaying couples and among the last arrivals the fenton carburys and ned bowfort the names were all familiar to amherst he knew they represented the flower of weekend fashion but he did not remember having seen the carburys among his wifes guests and his mind paused on the name seeking to regain some lost impression connected with it but it evoked like the others merely the confused sense of stridency and unrest which he had brought away from his last lynbrook visit and this reminiscence made him ask miss brent when her list was ended if she did not think that so continuous a succession of visitors was too tiring for bessy i sometimes think it tires her more than she knows but i hope she can be persuaded to take better care of herself now that mrs ansell has come back amherst halted abruptly is mrs ansell here she arrived from europe today and mr langhope too i suppose yes he came from newport about ten days ago amherst checked himself conscious that his questions betrayed the fact that he and his wife no longer wrote to each other the same thought appeared to strike justine and they walked across the lawn in silence hastening their steps involuntarily as though to escape the oppressive weight of the words which had passed between them but justine was unwilling that this fruitless sense of oppression should be the final outcome of their talk and when they reached the upper terrace she paused and turned impulsively to amherst as she did so the light from an uncurtained window fell on her face which glowed with the inner brightness kindled in it by moments of strong feeling i am sure of one thing bessy will be very very glad that you have come she exclaimed thank you he answered their hands met mechanically and she turned away and entered the house xvii bessy had not seen her little girl that day and filled with compunction by justines reminder she hastened directly to the schoolroom of late in certain moods her maternal tenderness had been clouded by a sense of uneasiness in the childs presence for cicely was the argument most effectually used by mr langhope and mr tredegar in their efforts to check the triumph of amhersts ideas bessy still unable to form an independent opinion on the harassing question of the mills continued to oscillate between the views of the contending parties now regarding cicely as an innocent victim and herself as an unnatural mother sacrificing her childs prospects to further amhersts enterprise and now conscious of a vague animosity against the little girl as the chief cause of the dissensions which had so soon clouded the skies of her second marriage then again there were moments when cicelys rosy bloom reminded her bitterly of the child she had lost the son on whom her ambitions had been fixed it seemed to her now that if their boy had lived she might have kept amhersts love and have played a more important part in his life and brooding on the tragedy of the childs sickly existence she resented the contrast of cicelys brightness and vigour the result was that in her treatment of her daughter she alternated between moments of exaggerated devotion and days of neglect never long happy away from the little girl yet restless and selftormenting in her presence after her talk with justine she felt more than usually disturbed as she always did when her unprofitable impulses of selfexposure had subsided bessys mind was not made for introspection and chance had burdened it with unintelligible problems she felt herself the victim of circumstances to which her imagination attributed the deliberate malice that children ascribe to the furniture they run against in playing this helped her to cultivate a sense of helpless injury and to disdain in advance the advice she was perpetually seeking how absurd it was for instance to suppose that a girl could understand the feelings of a married woman justines suggestion that she should humble herself still farther to amherst merely left in bessys mind a rankling sense of being misunderstood and undervalued by those to whom she turned in her extremity and she said to herself in a phrase that sounded well in her own ears that sooner or later every woman must learn to fight her battles alone in this mood she entered the room where cicely was at supper with her governess and enveloped the child in a whirl of passionate caresses but cicely had inherited the soberer westmore temper and her mothers spasmodic endearments always had a repressive effect on her she dutifully returned a small fraction of bessys kisses and then with an air of relief addressed herself once more to her bread and marmalade you dont seem a bit glad to see me bessy exclaimed while the little governess made a nervous pretence of being greatly amused at this prodigious paradox and cicely setting down her silver mug asked judicially why should i be gladder than other days it isnt a birthday this cordelialike answer cut bessy to the quick you horrid child to say such a cruel thing when you know i love you better and better every minute but you dont care for me any longer because justine has taken you away from me this last charge had sprung into her mind in the act of uttering it but now that it was spoken it instantly assumed the proportions of a fact and seemed to furnish another justification for her wretchedness bessy was not naturally jealous but her imagination was thrall to the spoken word and it gave her a sudden incomprehensible relief to associate justine with the obscure causes of her suffering i know shes cleverer than i am and more amusing and can tell you about plants and animals and thingsand i daresay she tells you how tiresome and stupid i am she sprang up suddenly abashed by cicelys astonished gaze and by the governesss tremulous attempt to continue to treat the scene as one of mammas most successful pleasantries dont mind me my head aches horribly i think ill rush off for a gallop on impulse before dinner miss dill cicelys nails are a sight i suppose that comes of grubbing up wildflowers and with this parting shot at justines pursuits she swept out of the schoolroom leaving pupil and teacher plunged in a stricken silence from which cicely at length emerged to say with the candour that miss dill dreaded more than any punishable offense mothers prettiest but i do like justine the best it was nearly dark when bessy mounted the horse which had been hastily saddled in response to her order but it was her habit to ride out alone at all hours and of late nothing but a hard gallop had availed to quiet her nerves her craving for occupation had increased as her life became more dispersed and agitated and the need to fill every hour drove her to excesses of bodily exertion since other forms of activity were unknown to her as she cantered along under the twilight sky with a strong seabreeze in her face the rush of air and the effort of steadying her nervous thoroughbred filled her with a glow of bodily energy from which her thoughts emerged somewhat cleansed of their bitterness she had been odious to poor little cicely for whom she now felt a sudden remorseful yearning which almost made her turn her horses head homeward that she might dash upstairs and do penance beside the childs bed and that she should have accused justine of taking cicely from her it frightened her to find herself thinking evil of justine bessy whose perceptions were keen enough in certain directions knew that her second marriage had changed her relation to all her former circle of friends though they still rallied about her keeping up the convenient habit of familiar intercourse she had begun to be aware that their view of her had in it an element of criticism and compassion she had once fancied that amhersts good looks and the other qualities she had seen in him would immediately make him free of the charmed circle in which she moved but she was discouraged by his disregard of his opportunities and above all by the fundamental differences in his view of life he was never common or ridiculous but she saw that he would never acquire the small social facilities he was fond of exercise but it bored him to talk of it the mens smokingroom anecdotes did not amuse him he was unmoved by the fluctuations of the stockmarket he could not tell one card from another and his perfunctory attempts at billiards had once caused mr langhope to murmur in his daughters hearing ah thats the test i always said so thus debarred from what seemed to bessy the chief points of contact with life how could amherst hope to impose himself on minds versed in these larger relations as the sense of his social insufficiency grew on her bessy became more sensitive to that latent criticism of her marriage which intolerable thought involved a judgment on herself she was increasingly eager for the approval and applause of her little audience yet increasingly distrustful of their sincerity and more miserably persuaded that she and her husband were the butt of some of their most effective stories she knew also that rumours of the disagreement about westmore were abroad and the suspicion that amhersts conduct was the subject of unfriendly comment provoked in her a reaction of loyalty to his ideas from this turmoil of conflicting influences only her friendship with justine brent remained secure though justines adaptability made it easy for her to fit into the lynbrook life bessy knew that she stood as much outside of it as amherst she could never for instance be influenced by what maria ansell and the gaineses and the telfers thought she had her own criteria of conduct unintelligible to bessy but giving her an independence of mind on which her friend leaned in a kind of blind security and that even her faith in justine should suddenly be poisoned by a jealous thought seemed to prove that the consequences of her marriage were gradually infecting her whole life bessy could conceive of masculine devotion only as subservient to its divinitys least wish and she argued that if amherst had really loved her he could not so lightly have disturbed the foundations of her world and so her tormented thoughts perpetually circling on themselves reverted once more to their central grievance the failure of her marriage if her own love had died out it would have been much simpler she was surrounded by examples of the mutual evasion of a troublesome tie there was blanche carbury for instance with whom she had lately struck up an absorbing friendshipit was perfectly clear that blanche carbury wondered how much more she was going to stand but it was the torment of bessys situation that it involved a radical contradiction that she still loved amherst though she could not forgive him for having married her perhaps what she most suffered from was his tooprompt acceptance of the semiestrangement between them after nearly three years of marriage she had still to learn that it was amhersts way to wrestle with the angel till dawn and then to go about his other business her own mind could revolve in the same grievance as interminably as a squirrel in its wheel and her husbands habit of casting off the accepted fact seemed to betoken poverty of feeling if only he had striven a little harder to keep her if even now he would come back to her and make her feel that she was more to him than those wretched mills when she turned her mare toward lynbrook the longing to see amherst was again uppermost he had not written for weeks she had been obliged to tell maria ansell that she knew nothing of his plans and it mortified her to think that every one was aware of his neglect yet even now if on reaching the house she should find a telegram to say that he was coming the weight of loneliness would be lifted and everything in life would seem different her highstrung mare scenting the homeward road and excited by the fantastic play of wayside lights and shadows swept her along at a wild gallop with which the fevered rush of her thoughts kept pace and when she reached the house she dropped from the saddle with aching wrists and brain benumbed she entered by a side door to avoid meeting any one and ran upstairs at once knowing that she had barely time to dress for dinner as she opened the door of her sittingroom some one rose from the chair by the fire and she stood still facing her husband it was the moment both had desired yet when it came it found them tonguetied and helpless bessy was the first to speak when did you get here you never wrote me you were coming amherst advanced toward her holding out his hand no you must forgive me i have been very busy he said always the same excuse the same thrusting at her of the hateful fact that westmore came first and that she must put up with whatever was left of his time and thoughts you are always too busy to let me hear from you she said coldly and the hand which had sprung toward his fell back to her side even then if he had only said frankly it was too difficult i didnt know how the note of truth would have reached and moved her but he had striven for the tone of ease and selfrestraint that was habitual among her friends and as usual his attempt had been a failure i am sorry im a bad hand at writing he rejoined and his evil genius prompted him to add i hope my coming is not inconvenient the colour rose to bessys face of course not but it must seem rather odd to our visitors that i should know so little of your plans at this he humbled himself still farther i know i dont think enough about appearances ill try to do better the next time appearances he spoke as if she had been reproaching him for a breach of etiquetteit never occurred to him that the cry came from her humiliated heart the tide of warmth that always enveloped her in his presence was receding and in its place a chill fluid seemed to creep up slowly to her throat and lips in amherst meanwhile the opposite process was taking place his wife was still to him the most beautiful woman in the world or rather perhaps the only woman to whose beauty his eyes had been opened that beauty could never again penetrate to his heart but it still touched his senses not with passion but with a caressing kindliness such as one might feel for the bright movements of a bird or a kitten it seemed to plead with him not to ask of her more than she could give to be content with the outward grace and not seek in it an inner meaning he moved toward her again and took her passive hands in his you look tired why do you ride so late oh i just wanted to give impulse a gallop i hadnt time to take her out earlier and if i let the grooms exercise her theyll spoil her mouth amherst frowned you ought not to ride that mare alone at night she shies at everything after dark shes the only horse i care for the others are all cows she murmured releasing her hands impatiently well you must take me with you the next time you ride her she softened a little in spite of herself riding was the only amusement he cared to share with her and the thought of a long gallop across the plains at his side brought back the warmth to her veins yes well go tomorrow how long do you mean to stay she asked looking up at him eagerly he was pleased that she should wish to know yet the question embarrassed him for it was necessary that he should be back at westmore within three days and he could not put her off with an evasion bessy saw his hesitation and her colour rose again i only asked she explained because there is to be a fancy ball at the hunt club on the twentieth and i thought of giving a big dinner here first amherst did not understand that she too had her inarticulate moments and that the allusion to the fancy ball was improvised to hide an eagerness to which he had been too slow in responding he thought she had enquired about his plans only that he might not again interfere with the arrangements of her dinnertable if that was all she cared about it became suddenly easy to tell her that he could not stay and he answered lightly fancy balls are a little out of my line but at any rate i shall have to be back at the mills the day after tomorrow the disappointment brought a rush of bitterness to her lips the day after tomorrow it seems hardly worth while to have come so far for two days oh i dont mind the journey and there are one or two matters i must consult you about there could hardly have been a more illadvised answer but amherst was reckless now if she cared for his coming only that he might fill a place at a fancydress dinner he would let her see that he had come only because he had to go through the form of submitting to her certain measures to be taken at westmore bessy was beginning to feel the physical reaction of her struggle with the mare the fatigue which at first had deadened her nerves now woke them to acuter sensibility and an appealing word from her husband would have drawn her to his arms but his answer seemed to drive all the blood back to her heart i dont see why you still go through the form of consulting me about westmore when you have always done just as you pleased there without regard to me or cicely amherst made no answer silenced by the discouragement of hearing the same old grievance on her lips and she too seemed struck after she had spoken by the unprofitableness of such retorts it doesnt matter of course ill do whatever you wish she went on listlessly but i could have sent my signature if that is all you came for thanks said amherst coldly i shall remember that the next time they stood silent for a moment he with his eyes fixed on her she with averted head twisting her ridingwhip between her fingers then she said suddenly we shall be late for dinner and passing into her dressingroom she closed the door amherst roused himself as she disappeared bessy he exclaimed moving toward her but as he approached the door he heard her maids voice within and turning away he went to his own room bessy came down late to dinner with vivid cheeks and an air of improvised ease and the manner of her entrance combined with her husbands unannounced arrival produced in their observant guests the sense of latent complications mr langhope though evidently unaware of his soninlaws return till they greeted each other in the drawingroom was too good a cardplayer to betray surprise and mrs ansell outdid herself in the delicate art of taking everything for granted but these very dissimulations sharpened the perception of the other guests whom long practice had rendered expert in interpreting such signs of all this justine brent was aware and conscious also that by every one but herself the suspected estrangement between the amhersts was regarded as turning merely on the question of money to the greater number of persons present there was in fact no other conceivable source of conjugal discord since every known complication could be adjusted by means of the universal lubricant it was this unanimity of view which bound together in the compactness of a new feudalism the members of bessy amhersts world which supplied them with their passwords and social tests and defended them securely against the insidious attack of ideas the genius of history capriciously directing the antics of its marionettes sometimes lets the drama languish through a series of unrelated episodes and then suddenly quickening the pace packs into one scene the stuff of a dozen the chance meeting of amherst and justine seemingly of no significance to either contained the germ of developments of which both had begun to be aware before the evening was over their short talk the first really intimate exchange of words between them had the effect of creating a sense of solidarity that grew apace in the atmosphere of the lynbrook dinnertable justine was always reluctant to take part in bessys weekend dinners but as she descended the stairs that evening she did not regret having promised to be present she frankly wanted to see amherst again his tone his view of life reinforced her own convictions restored her faith in the reality and importance of all that lynbrook ignored and excluded her extreme sensitiveness to surrounding vibrations of thought and feeling told her as she glanced at him between the flowers and candles of the long dinnertable that he too was obscurely aware of the same effect and it flashed across her that they were unconsciously drawn together by the fact that they were the only two strangers in the room every one else had the same standpoint spoke the same language drew on the same stock of allusions used the same weights and measures in estimating persons and actions between mr langhopes indolent acuteness of mind and the rudimentary processes of the rosy telfers there was a difference of degree but not of kind if mr langhope viewed the spectacle more objectively it was not because he had outlived the sense of its importance but because years of experience had familiarized him with its minutest details and this familiarity with the world he lived in had bred a profound contempt for any other in no way could the points of contact between amherst and justine brent have been more vividly brought out than by their tacit exclusion from the currents of opinion about them amherst seated in unsmiling endurance at the foot of the table between mrs ansell with her carefullydistributed affabilities and blanche carbury with her reckless hurling of conversational pebbles seemed to justine as much of a stranger as herself among the people to whom his marriage had introduced him so strongly did she feel the sense of their common isolation that it was no surprise to her when the men reappeared in the drawingroom after dinner to have her host thread his way between the unfolding bridgetables straight to the corner where she sat amhersts methods in the drawingroom were still as direct as in the cottonmill he always went up at once to the person he sought without preliminary waste of tactics and on this occasion justine without knowing what had passed between himself and bessy suspected from the appearance of both that their talk had resulted in increasing amhersts desire to be with some one to whom he could speak freely and naturally on the subject nearest his heart she began at once to question him about westmore and the change in his face showed that his work was still a refuge from all that made life disheartening and unintelligible whatever convictions had been thwarted or impaired in him his faith in the importance of his task remained unshaken and the firmness with which he held to it filled justine with a sense of his strength the feeling kindled her own desire to escape again into the world of deeds yet by a sudden reaction it checked the growing inclination for stephen wyant that had resulted from her revolt against lynbrook here was a man as careless as wyant of the minor forms yet her appreciation of him was not affected by the lack of adaptability that she accused herself of criticizing in her suitor she began to see that it was not the sense of wyants social deficiencies that had held her back and the discovery at once set free her judgment of him enabling her to penetrate to the real causes of her reluctance she understood now that the flaw she felt was far deeper than any defect of manner it was the sense in him of something unstable and incalculable something at once weak and violent that was brought to light by the contrast of amhersts quiet resolution here was a man whom no gusts of chance could deflect from his purpose while she felt that the career to which wyant had so ardently given himself would always be at the mercy of his passing emotions as the distinction grew clearer justine trembled to think that she had so nearly pledged herself without the excuse of love to a man whose failings she could judge so lucidly but had she ever really thought of marrying wyant while she continued to talk with amherst such a possibility became more and more remote till she began to feel it was no more than a haunting dream but her promise to see wyant the next day reminded her of the nearness of her peril how could she have played with her fate so lightly she who held her life so dear because she felt in it such untried powers of action and emotion she continued to listen to amhersts account of his work with enough outward selfpossession to place the right comment and put the right question yet conscious only of the quiet strength she was absorbing from his presence of the way in which his words his voice his mere nearness were slowly steadying and clarifying her will in the smokingroom after the ladies had gone upstairs amherst continued to acquit himself mechanically of his duties against the incongruous background of his predecessors remarkable sportingprints for it was characteristic of his relation to lynbrook that his life there was carried on in the setting of foils and boxinggloves firearms and racingtrophies which had expressed dick westmores ideals never very keenly alive to his material surroundings and quite unconscious of the irony of this proximity amherst had come to accept his wifes guests as unquestioningly as their background and with the same sense of their being an inevitable part of his new life their talk was no more intelligible to him than the red and yellow hieroglyphics of the racingprints and he smoked in silence while mr langhope discoursed to westy gaines on the recent sale of chinese porcelains at which he had been lucky enough to pick up the set of ming for his daughter and mason winch expounded to a group of languid listeners the essential dependence of the labouringman on the prosperity of wall street in a retired corner ned bowfort was imparting facts of a more personal nature to a chosen following who hailed with suppressed enjoyment the murmured mention of proper names and now and then amherst found himself obliged to say to fenton carbury who with one accord had been left on his hands yes i understand the flattread tire is best or theres a good deal to be said for the low tension magneto but all the while his conscious thoughts were absorbed in the remembrance of his talk with justine brent he had left his wifes presence in that state of moral lassitude when the strongest hopes droop under the infection of indifference and hostility and the effort of attainment seems out of all proportion to the end in view but as he listened to justine all his energies sprang to life again here at last was some one who felt the urgency of his task her every word and look confirmed her comment of the afternoon westmore must be foremost to you both in time i dont see how either of you can escape it she saw it as he did to be the special outlet offered for the expression of what he was worth to the world and with the knowledge that one other person recognized his call it sounded again loudly in his heart yes he would go on patiently and persistently conquering obstacles suffering delay enduring criticism hardest of all bearing with his wifes deepening indifference and distrust justine had said westmore must be foremost to you both and he would prove that she was right spite of the powers leagued against him he would win over bessy in the end those observers who had been struck by the length and animation of miss brents talk with her host and among whom mrs ansell and westy gaines were foremost would hardly have believed how small a part her personal charms had played in attracting him amherst was still under the power of the other kind of beauty the soft graces personifying the first triumph of sex in his heart and justines dark slenderness could not at once dispel the milder image he watched her with pleasure while she talked but her face interested him only as the vehicle of her ideas she looked as a girl must look who felt and thought as she did he was aware that everything about her was quick and fine and supple and that the muscles of character lay close to the surface of feeling but the interpenetration of spirit and flesh that made her body seem like the bright projection of her mind left him unconscious of anything but the oneness of their thoughts so these two in their hour of doubt poured strength into each others hearts each unconscious of what they gave and of its hidden power of renewing their own purposes xviii if mr langhope had ever stooped to such facile triumphs as that summed up in the convenient i told you so he would have loosed the phrase on mrs ansell in the course of a colloquy which these two the next afternoon were at some pains to defend from the incursions of the lynbrook houseparty mrs ansell was the kind of woman who could encircle herself with privacy on an excursionboat and create a nook in an hotel drawingroom but it taxed even her ingenuity to segregate herself from the telfers when the feat was accomplished and it became evident that mr langhope could yield himself securely to the joys of confidential discourse he paused on the brink of disclosure to say its as well i saved that ming from the ruins what ruins she exclaimed her startled look giving him the full benefit of the effect he was seeking to produce he addressed himself deliberately to the selecting and lighting of a cigarette truscomb is down and out resigned the wise it call and the alterations at westmore are going to cost a great deal more than my experienced soninlaw expected this is westys morning budget he and amherst had it out last night i tell my poor girl that at least shell lose nothing when the bibelots ive bought for her go up the spout mrs ansell received this with a troubled countenance what has become of bessy ive not seen her since luncheon no she and blanche carbury have motored over to dine with the nick ledgers at islip did you see her before she left for a moment but she said very little westy tells me that amherst hints at leasing the new york house one can understand that shes left speechless mrs ansell at this sat bolt upright the new york house but she broke off to add with seeming irrelevance if you knew how i detest blanche carbury mr langhope made a gesture of semiacquiescence she is not the friend i should have chosen for bessy but we know that providence makes use of strange instruments providence and blanche carbury she stared at him ah you are profoundly corrupt i have the coarse masculine habit of looking facts in the face womanlike you prefer to make use of them privately and cut them when you meet in public blanche is not the kind of fact i should care to make use of under any circumstances whatever no one asks you to simply regard her as a force of nature let her alone and dont put up too many lightningrods she raised her eyes to his face do you really mean that you want bessy to get a divorce your style is elliptical dear maria but divorce does not frighten me very much it has grown almost as painless as modern dentistry its our odious insensibility that makes it so mr langhope received this with the mildness of suspended judgment how else then do you propose that bessy shall save what is left of her money i would rather see her save what is left of her happiness bessy will never be happy in the new way what do you call the new way launching ones boat over a human body or several as the case may be but dont you see that as an expedient to bring this madman to reason ive told you that you dont understand him mr langhope turned on her with what would have been a show of temper in any one less provided with shades of manner well then explain him for gods sake i might explain him by saying that shes still in love with him ah if youre still imprisoned in the old formulas mrs ansell confronted him with a grave face isnt that precisely what bessy is isnt she one of the most harrowing victims of the plan of bringing up our girls in the double bondage of expediency and unreality corrupting their bodies with luxury and their brains with sentiment and leaving them to reconcile the two as best they can or lose their souls in the attempt mr langhope smiled i may observe that with my poor child so early left alone to me i supposed i was doing my best in committing her guidance to some of the most admirable women i know of whom i was one and not the least lamentable example of the system of course the only thing that saves us from their vengeance mrs ansell added is that so few of them ever stop to think and yet as i make out its precisely what you would have bessy do its what neither you nor i can help her doing youve given her just acuteness enough to question without consecutiveness enough to explain but if she must perish in the struggle and i see no hope for her cried mrs ansell starting suddenly and dramatically to her feet at least let her perish defending her ideals and not denying them even if she has to sell the new york house and all your china pots into the bargain mr langhope rising also deprecatingly lifted his hands if thats what you call saving me from her vengeance sending the crockery crashing round my ears and as she turned away without any pretense of capping his pleasantry he added with a gleam of friendly malice i suppose youre going to the hunt ball as cassandra amherst that morning had sought out his wife with the definite resolve to efface the unhappy impression of their previous talk he blamed himself for having been too easily repelled by her impatience as the stronger of the two with the power of a fixed purpose to sustain him he should have allowed for the instability of her impulses and above all for the automatic influences of habit knowing that she did not keep early hours he delayed till ten oclock to present himself at her sittingroom door but the maid who answered his knock informed him that mrs amherst was not yet up his reply that he would wait did not appear to hasten the leisurely process of her toilet and he had the room to himself for a full halfhour many months had passed since he had spent so long a time in it and though habitually unobservant of external details he now found an outlet for his restlessness in mechanically noting the intimate appurtenances of bessys life he was at first merely conscious of a soothing harmony of line and colour extending from the blurred tints of the rug to the subdued gleam of light on old pictureframes and on the slender flanks of porcelain vases but gradually he began to notice how every chair and screen and cushion and even every trifling utensil on the inlaid writingdesk had been chosen with reference to the whole composition and to the minutest requirements of a fastidious leisure a few months ago this studied setting if he had thought of it at all would have justified itself as expressing the pretty womans natural affinity with pretty toys but now it was the cost of it that struck him he was beginning to learn from bessys bills that no commodity is taxed as high as beauty and the beauty about him filled him with sudden repugnance as the disguise of the evil influences that were separating his wifes life from his but with her entrance he dismissed the thought and tried to meet her as if nothing stood in the way of their full communion her hair still wet from the bath broke from its dryadlike knot in dusky rings and spirals threaded with gold and from her loose flexible draperies and her whole person as she moved there came a scent of youth and morning freshness her beauty touched him and made it easier for him to humble himself i was stupid and disagreeable last night i can never say what i want when i have to count the minutes and ive come back now for a quiet talk he began a shade of distrust passed over bessys face about business she asked pausing a few feet away from him dont let us give it that name he went up to her and drew her two hands into his you used to call it our work wont you go back to that way of looking at it her hands resisted his pressure i didnt know then that it was going to be the only thing you cared for but for her own sake he would not let her go on some day i shall make you see how much my caring for it means my caring for you but meanwhile he urged wont you overcome your aversion to the subject and bear with it as my work if you no longer care to think of it as yours bessy freeing herself sat down on the edge of the straightbacked chair near the desk as though to mark the parenthetical nature of the interview i know you think me stupid but wives are not usually expected to go into all the details of their husbands business i have told you to do whatever you wish at westmore and i cant see why that is not enough amherst looked at her in surprise something in her quick mechanical utterance suggested that not only the thought but the actual words she spoke had been inspired and he fancied he heard in them an echo of blanche carburys tones though bessys intimacy with mrs carbury was of such recent date fragments of unheeded smokingroom gossip now recurred to confirm the vague antipathy which amherst had felt for her the previous evening i know that among your friends wives are not expected to interest themselves in their husbands work and if the mills were mine i should try to conform to the custom though i should always think it a pity that the questions that fill a mans thoughts should be ruled out of his talk with his wife but as it is i am only your representative at westmore and i dont see how we can help having the subject come up between us bessy remained silent not as if acquiescing in his plea but as though her own small stock of arguments had temporarily failed her and he went on enlarging on his theme with a careful avoidance of technical terms and with the constant effort to keep the human and personal side of the question before her she listened without comment her eyes fixed on a little jewelled letteropener which she had picked up from the writingtable and which she continued to turn in her fingers while he spoke the full development of amhersts plans at westmore besides resulting as he had foreseen in truscombs resignation and in halford gainess outspoken resistance to the new policy had necessitated a larger immediate outlay of capital than the first estimates demanded and amherst in putting his case to bessy was prepared to have her meet it on the old ground of the disapproval of all her advisers but when he had ended she merely said without looking up from the toy in her hand i always expected that you would need a great deal more money than you thought the comment touched him at his most vulnerable point but you see why you understand how the work has gone on growing his wife lifted her head to glance at him for a moment i am not sure that i understand she said indifferently but if another loan is necessary of course i will sign the note for it the words checked his reply by bringing up before he was prepared to deal with it the other and more embarrassing aspect of the question he had hoped to reawaken in bessy some feeling for the urgency of his task before having to take up the subject of its cost but her cold anticipation of his demands as part of a disagreeable business to be despatched and put out of mind doubled the difficulty of what he had left to say and it occurred to him that she had perhaps foreseen and reckoned on this result he met her eyes gravely another loan is necessary but if any proper provision is to be made for paying it back your expenses will have to be cut down a good deal for the next few months the blood leapt to bessys face my expenses you seem to forget how much ive had to cut them down already the household bills certainly dont show it they are increasing steadily and there have been some very heavy incidental payments lately what do you mean by incidental payments well there was the pair of cobs you bought last month she returned to a resigned contemplation of the letteropener with only one motor one must have more horses of course the stables seemed to me fairly full before but if you required more horses i dont see why at this particular moment it was also necessary to buy a set of chinese vases for twentyfive hundred dollars bessy at this lifted her head with an air of decision that surprised him her blush had faded as quickly as it came and he noticed that she was pale to the lips i know you dont care about such things but i had an exceptional chance of securing the vases at a low price they are really worth twice as much and dick always wanted a set of ming for the drawingroom mantelpiece richard westmores name was always tacitly avoided between them for in amhersts case the disagreeable sense of dependence on a dead mans bounty increased that feeling of obscure constraint and repugnance which any reminder of the first husbands existence is wont to produce in his successor he reddened at the reply and bessy profiting by an embarrassment which she had perhaps consciously provoked went on hastily and as if by rote i have left you perfectly free to do as you think best at the mills but this perpetual discussion of my personal expenses is very unpleasant to me as i am sure it must be to you and in future i think it would be much better for us to have separate accounts separate accounts amherst echoed in genuine astonishment i should like my personal expenses to be under my own control again i have never been used to accounting for every penny i spend the vertical lines deepened between amhersts brows you are of course free to spend your money as you like and i thought you were doing so when you authorized me last spring to begin the changes at westmore her lip trembled do you reproach me for that i didnt understandyou took advantage oh he exclaimed at his tone the blood rushed back to her face it was my fault of course i only wanted to please you amherst was silent confronted by the sudden sense of his own responsibility what she said was true he had known when he exacted the sacrifice that she made it only to please him on an impulse of reawakened feeling and not from any real recognition of a larger duty the perception of this made him answer gently i am willing to take any blame you think i deserve but it wont help us now to go back to the past it is more important that we should come to an understanding about the future if by keeping your personal account separate you mean that you wish to resume control of your whole income then you ought to understand that the improvements at the mills will have to be dropped at once and things there go back to their old state she started up with an impatient gesture oh i should like never to hear of the mills again he looked at her a moment in silence am i to take that as your answer she walked toward her door without returning his look of course she murmured you will end by doing as you please the retort moved him for he heard in it the cry of her wounded pride he longed to be able to cry out in return that westmore was nothing to him that all he asked was to see her happy but it was not true and his manhood revolted from the deception besides its effect would be only temporary would wear no better than her vain efforts to simulate an interest in his work between them forever were the insurmountable barriers of character of education of habit and yet it was not in him to believe that any barrier was insurmountable bessy he exclaimed following her dont let us part in this way she paused with her hand on her dressingroom door it is time to dress for church she objected turning to glance at the little gilt clock on the chimneypiece for church amherst stared wondering that at such a crisis she should have remained detached enough to take note of the hour you forget she replied with an air of gentle reproof that before we married i was in the habit of going to church every sunday yes to be sure would you not like me to go with you he rejoined gently as if roused to the consciousness of another omission in the long list of his social shortcomings for churchgoing at lynbrook had always struck him as a purely social observance but bessy had opened the door of her dressingroom i much prefer that you should do what you like she said as she passed from the room amherst made no farther attempt to detain her and the door closed on her as though it were closing on a chapter in their lives thats the end of it he murmured picking up the letteropener she had been playing with and twirling it absently in his fingers but nothing in life ever ends and the next moment a new question confronted him how was the next chapter to open book iii xix it was late in october when amherst returned to lynbrook he had begun to learn in the interval the lesson most difficult to his direct and trenchant nature that compromise is the law of married life on the afternoon of his talk with his wife he had sought her out determined to make a final effort to clear up the situation between them but he learned that immediately after luncheon she had gone off in the motor with mrs carbury and two men of the party leaving word that they would probably not be back till evening it cost amherst a struggle when he had humbled himself to receive this information from the butler not to pack his portmanteau and take the first train for hanaford but he was still under the influence of justine brents words and also of his own feeling that at this juncture a break between himself and bessy would be final he stayed on accordingly enduring as best he might the mute observation of the household and the gentle irony of mr langhopes attentions and before he left lynbrook two days later a provisional understanding had been reached his wife proved more firm than he had foreseen in her resolve to regain control of her income and the talk between them ended in reciprocal concessions bessy consenting to let the town house for the winter and remain at lynbrook while amherst agreed to restrict his improvements at westmore to such alterations as had already been begun and to reduce the expenditure on these as much as possible it was virtually the defeat of his policy and he had to suffer the decent triumph of the gaineses as well as the bitterer pang of his foiled aspirations in spite of the opposition of the directors he had taken advantage of truscombs resignation to put duplain at the head of the mills but the new managers outspoken disgust at the companys change of plan made it clear that he would not remain long at westmore and it was one of the miseries of amhersts situation that he could not give the reasons for his defection but must bear to figure in duplains terse vocabulary as a quitter the difficulty of finding a new manager expert enough to satisfy the directors yet in sympathy with his own social theories made amherst fear that duplains withdrawal would open the way for truscombs reinstatement an outcome on which he suspected halford gaines had always counted and this possibility loomed before him as the final defeat of his hopes meanwhile the issues ahead had at least the merit of keeping him busy the task of modifying and retrenching his plans contrasted drearily with the hopeful activity of the past months but he had an iron capacity for hard work under adverse conditions and the fact of being too busy for thought helped him to wear through the days this pressure of work relieved him at first from too close consideration of his relation to bessy he had yielded up his dearest hopes at her wish and for the moment his renunciation had set a chasm between them but gradually he saw that as he was patching together the ruins of his westmore plans so he must presently apply himself to the reconstruction of his married life before leaving lynbrook he had had a last word with miss brent not a word of confidence for the same sense of reserve kept both from any explicit renewal of their moments intimacy but one of those exchanges of commonplace phrase that circumstances may be left to charge with special meaning justine had merely asked if he were really leaving and on his assenting had exclaimed quickly but you will come back soon i shall certainly come back he answered and after a pause he added i shall find you here you will remain at lynbrook on her part also there was a shade of hesitation then she said with a smile yes i shall stay his look brightened and youll write me if anything if bessy should not be well i will write you she promised and a few weeks after his return to hanaford he had in fact received a short note from her its ostensible purpose was to reassure him as to bessys health which had certainly grown stronger since dr wyant had persuaded her at the close of the last houseparty to accord herself a period of quiet but the writer added now that mr langhope and mrs ansell had also left the quiet was perhaps too complete and bessys nerves were beginning to suffer from the reaction amherst had no difficulty in interpreting this brief communication i have succeeded in dispersing the people who are always keeping you and your wife apart now is your chance come and take it that was what miss brents letter meant and his answer was a telegram to bessy announcing his return to long island the step was not an easy one but decisive action however hard was always easier to amherst than the ensuing interval of readjustment to come to lynbrook had required a strong effort of will but the effort of remaining there called into play less disciplined faculties amherst had always been used to doing things now he had to resign himself to enduring a state of things the material facilities of the life about him the way in which the machinery of the great empty house ran on like some complex apparatus working in the void increased the exasperation of his nerves dr wyants suggestion which amherst suspected justine of having prompted that mrs amherst should cancel her autumn engagements and give herself up to a quiet outdoor life with her husband seemed to present the very opportunity these two distracted spirits needed to find and repossess each other but though amherst was grateful to bessy for having dismissed her visitors partly to please him as he guessed yet he found the routine of the establishment more oppressive than when the house was full if he could have been alone with her in a quiet corner the despised cottage at westmore even he fancied they might still have been brought together by restricted space and the familiar exigencies of life all the primitive necessities which bind together through their recurring daily wants natures fated to find no higher point of union had been carefully eliminated from the life at lynbrook where material needs were not only provided for but anticipated by a hidden mechanism that filled the house with the perpetual sense of invisible attendance though amherst knew that he and bessy could never meet in the region of great issues he thought he might have regained the way to her heart and found relief from his own inaction in the small ministrations of daily life but the next moment he smiled to picture bessy in surroundings where the clocks were not wound of themselves and the doors did not fly open at her approach those thickcrowding cares and drudgeries which serve as merciful screens between so many discordant natures would have been as intolerable to her as was to amherst the great glare of leisure in which he and she were now confronted he saw that bessy was in the state of propitiatory eagerness which always followed on her gaining a point in their long duel and he could guess that she was tremulously anxious not only to make up to him by all the arts she knew for the sacrifice she had exacted but also to conceal from every one the fact that as mr langhope bluntly put it he had been brought to terms amherst was touched by her efforts and halfashamed of his own inability to respond to them but his mind released from its normal preoccupations had become a dangerous instrument of analysis and disintegration and conditions which a few months before he might have accepted with the wholesome tolerance of the busy man now pressed on him unendurably he saw that he and his wife were really face to face for the first time since their marriage hitherto something had always intervened between them first the spell of her grace and beauty and the brief joy of her participation in his work then the sorrow of their childs death and after that the temporary exhilaration of carrying out his ideas at westmore but now that the last of these veils had been torn away they faced each other as strangers the habit of keeping factory hours always drove amherst forth long before his wifes day began and in the course of one of his early tramps he met miss brent and cicely setting out for a distant swamp where rumour had it that a rare native orchid might be found justines sylvan tastes had developed in the little girl a passion for such pillaging expeditions and cicely who had discovered that her stepfather knew almost as much about birds and squirrels as miss brent did about flowers was not to be appeased till amherst had scrambled into the ponycart wedging his long legs between a fernbox and a lunchbasket and balancing a scotch terriers telescopic body across his knees the season was so mild that only one or two light windless frosts had singed the foliage of oaks and beeches and gilded the roadsides with a smooth carpeting of maple leaves the morning haze rose like smoke from burntout pyres of sumach and sugarmaple a silver bloom lay on the furrows of the ploughed fields and now and then as they drove on the wooded road showed at its end a tarnished disk of light where sea and sky were merged at length they left the road for a winding track through scruboaks and glossy thickets of mountainlaurel the track died out at the foot of a wooded knoll and clambering along its base they came upon the swamp there it lay in charmed solitude shut in by a tawny growth of larch and swampmaple its edges burnt out to smouldering shades of russet emberred and ashengrey while the quaking centre still preserved a jewellike green where hidden lanes of moisture wound between islets tufted with swampcranberry and with the charred browns of fern and wild rose and bay sodden earth and decaying branches gave forth a strange sweet odour as of the aromatic essences embalming a dead summer and the air charged with this scent was so still that the snapping of witchhazel pods the drop of a nut the leap of a startled frog pricked the silence with separate points of sound the pony made fast the terrier released and fernbox and lunchbasket slung over amhersts shoulder the three explorers set forth on their journey amherst as became his sex went first but after a few absentminded plunges into the sedgy depths between the islets he was ordered to relinquish his command and fall to the rear where he might perform the humbler service of occasionally lifting cicely over unspannable gulfs of moisture justine leading the way guided them across the treacherous surface as fearlessly as a kingfisher lighting instinctively on every grasstussock and submerged treestump of the uncertain path now and then she paused her feet drawn close on their narrow perch and her slender body swaying over as she reached down for some rare growth detected among the withered reeds and grasses then she would right herself again by a backward movement as natural as the upward spring of a branch so free and flexible in all her motions that she seemed akin to the swaying reeds and curving brambles which caught at her as she passed at length the explorers reached the mossy corner where the orchids grew and cicely securely balanced on a fallen treetrunk was allowed to dig the coveted roots when they had been packed away it was felt that this culminating moment must be celebrated with immediate libations of jam and milk and having climbed to a dry slope among the pepperbushes the party fell on the contents of the lunchbasket it was just the hour when bessys maid was carrying her breakfasttray with its delicate service of old silver and porcelain into the darkened bedroom at lynbrook but early rising and hard scrambling had whetted the appetites of the naturalists and the nursery fare which cicely spread before them seemed a sumptuous reward for their toil i do like this kind of picnic much better than the ones where mother takes all the footmen and the mayonnaise has to be scraped off things before i can eat them cicely declared lifting her foaming mouth from a beaker of milk amherst lighting his pipe stretched himself contentedly among the pepperbushes steeped in that unreflecting peace which is shed into some hearts by communion with trees and sky he too was glad to get away from the footmen and the mayonnaise and he imagined that his stepdaughters exclamation summed up all the reasons for his happiness the boyish woodcraft which he had cultivated in order to encourage the same taste in his factory lads came to life in this sudden return to nature and he redeemed his clumsiness in crossing the swamp by spying a marshwrens nest that had escaped justine and detecting in a swiftlyflitting olivebrown bird a belated tanager in autumn incognito cicely sat rapt while he pictured the birds winter pilgrimage with glimpses of the seas and islands that fled beneath him till his long southern flight ended in the dim glades of the equatorial forests oh what a good life how i should like to be a wanderbird and look down peoples chimneys twice a year justine laughed tilting her head back to catch a last glimpse of the tanager the sun beamed full on their ledge from a sky of misty blue and she had thrown aside her hat uncovering her thick waves of hair blueblack in the hollows with warm rusty edges where they took the light cicely dragged down a plumy spray of travellers joy and wound it above her friends forehead and thus wreathed with her bright pallour relieved against the dusky autumn tints justine looked like a woodspirit who had absorbed into herself the last golden juices of the year she leaned back laughing against a treetrunk pelting cicely with witchhazel pods making the terrier waltz for scraps of gingerbread and breaking off now and then to imitate with her clear full notes the call of some hidden marshbird or the scolding chatter of a squirrel in the scruboaks is that what youd like most about the journey looking down the chimneys amherst asked with a smile oh i dont know i should love it all think of the joy of skimming over half the earth seeing it born again out of darkness every morning sometimes when ive been up all night with a patient and have seen the world come back to me like that ive been almost mad with its beauty and then the thought that ive never seen more than a little corner of it makes me feel as if i were chained but i think if i had wings i should choose to be a houseswallow and then after id had my fill of wonders i should come back to my familiar corner and my house full of busy humdrum people and fly low to warn them of rain and wheel up high to show them it was good haying weather and know what was going on in every room in the house and every house in the village and all the while i should be hugging my wonderful big secret the secret of snowplains and burning deserts and coral islands and buried cities and should put it all into my chatter under the eaves that the people in the house were always too busy to stop and listen to and when winter came im sure i should hate to leave them even to go back to my great brazilian forests full of orchids and monkeys but justine in winter you could take care of the monkeys the practical cicely suggested yes and that would remind me of home justine cried swinging about to pinch the little girls chin she was in one of the buoyant moods when the spirit of life caught her in its grip and shook and tossed her on its mighty waves as a seabird is tossed through the spray of flying rollers at such moments all the light and music of the world seemed distilled into her veins and forced up in bubbles of laughter to her lips and eyes amherst had never seen her thus and he watched her with the sense of relaxation which the contact of limpid gaiety brings to a mind obscured by failure and selfdistrust the world was not so dark a place after all if such springs of merriment could well up in a heart as sensitive as hers to the burden and toil of existence isnt it strange she went on with a sudden drop to gravity that the bird whose wings carry him farthest and show him the most wonderful things is the one who always comes back to the eaves and is happiest in the thick of everyday life her eyes met amhersts it seems to me he said that youre like that yourself loving long flights yet happiest in the thick of life she raised her dark brows laughingly so i imagine but then you see ive never had the long flight amherst smiled ah there it is one never knows one never says this is the moment because however good it is it always seems the door to a better one beyond faust never said it till the end when hed nothing left of all he began by thinking worth while and then with what a difference it was said she pondered yes but it was the best after all the moment in which he had nothing left oh cicely broke in suddenly do look at the squirrel up there see father hes off lets follow him as she crouched there with head thrown back and sparkling lips and eyes her fair hair of her mothers very hue making a shining haze about her face amherst recalled the winter evening at hopewood when he and bessy had tracked the grey squirrel under the snowy beeches scarcely three years ago and how bitter memory had turned a chilly cloud spread over his spirit reducing everything once more to the leaden hue of reality its too late for any more adventures we must be going he said xx amhersts morning excursions with his stepdaughter and miss brent renewed themselves more than once he welcomed any pretext for escaping from the unprofitable round of his thoughts and these woodland explorations with their gay rivalry of search for some rare plant or elusive bird and the contact with the childs happy wonder and with the morning brightness of justines mood gave him his only moments of selfforgetfulness but the first time that cicelys chatter carried home an echo of their adventures amherst saw a cloud on his wifes face her resentment of justines influence over the child had long since subsided and in the temporary absence of the governess she was glad to have cicely amused but she was never quite satisfied that those about her should have pursuits and diversions in which she did not share her jealousy did not concentrate itself on her husband and miss brent amherst had never shown any inclination for the society of other women and if the possibility had been suggested to her she would probably have said that justine was not in his style so unconscious is a pretty woman apt to be of the versatility of masculine tastes but amherst saw that she felt herself excluded from amusements in which she had no desire to join and of which she consequently failed to see the purpose and he gave up accompanying his stepdaughter bessy as if in acknowledgment of his renunciation rose earlier in order to prolong their rides together dr wyant had counselled her against the fatigue of following the hounds and she instinctively turned their horses away from the course the hunt was likely to take but now and then the cry of the pack or the flash of red on a distant slope sent the blood to her face and made her press her mare to a gallop when they escaped such encounters she showed no great zest in the exercise and their rides resolved themselves into a spiritless middleaged jog along the autumn lanes in the early days of their marriage the joy of a canter side by side had merged them in a community of sensation beyond need of speech but now that the physical spell had passed they felt the burden of a silence that neither knew how to break once only a moments friction galvanized these lifeless rides it was one morning when bessys wild mare impulse underexercised and overfed suddenly broke from her control and would have unseated her but for amhersts grasp on the bridle the horse is not fit for you to ride he exclaimed as the hot creature with shudders of defiance rippling her flanks lapsed into sullen subjection its only because i dont ride her enough bessy panted that new groom is ruining her mouth you must not ride her alone then i shall not let that man ride her i say you must not ride her alone its ridiculous to have a groom at ones heels nevertheless you must if you ride impulse their eyes met and she quivered and yielded like the horse oh if you say so she always hugged his brief flashes of authority i do say so you promise me if you like amherst had made an attempt to occupy himself with the condition of lynbrook one of those slovenly villages without individual character or the tradition of selfrespect which spring up in america on the skirts of the rich summer colonies but bessy had never given lynbrook a thought and he realized the futility of hoping to interest her in its mongrel population of daylabourers and publicans so soon after his glaring failure at westmore the sight of the village irritated him whenever he passed through the lynbrook gates but having perforce accepted the situation of prince consort without voice in the government he tried to put himself out of relation with all the questions which had hitherto engrossed him and to see life simply as a spectator he could even conceive that under certain conditions there might be compensations in the passive attitude but unfortunately these conditions were not such as the life at lynbrook presented the temporary cessation of bessys weekend parties had naturally not closed her doors to occasional visitors and glimpses of the autumnal animation of long island passed now and then across the amhersts horizon blanche carbury had installed herself at mapleside a fashionable colony halfway between lynbrook and clifton and even amherst unused as he was to noting the seemingly inconsecutive movements of idle people could not but remark that her visits to his wife almost invariably coincided with ned bowforts cantering over unannounced from the hunt club where he had taken up his autumn quarters there was something very likeable about bowfort to whom amherst was attracted by the fact that he was one of the few men of bessys circle who knew what was going on in the outer world throughout an existence which one divined to have been both dependent and desultory he had preserved a sense of wider relations and acquired a smattering of information to which he applied his only independent faculty that of clear thought he could talk intelligently and not too inaccurately of the larger questions which lynbrook ignored and a gay indifference to the importance of money seemed the crowning grace of his nature till amherst suddenly learned that this attitude of detachment was generally ascribed to the liberality of mrs fenton carbury everybody knows she married fenton to provide for ned some one let fall in the course of one of the smokingroom dissertations on which the host of lynbrook had such difficulty in fixing his attention and the speakers matterofcourse tone and the careless acquiescence of his hearers were more offensive to amherst than the fact itself in the first flush of his disgust he classed the story as one of the lies bred in the malarious air of afterdinner gossip but gradually he saw that whether true or not it had sufficient circulation to cast a shade of ambiguity on the persons concerned bessy alone seemed deaf to the rumours about her friend there was something captivating to her in mrs carburys slang and noise in her defiance of decorum and contempt of criticism i like blanche because she doesnt pretend was bessys vague justification of the lady but in reality she was under the mysterious spell which such natures cast over the less venturesome imaginations of their own sex amherst at first tried to deaden himself to the situation as part of the larger coil of miseries in which he found himself but all his traditions were against such tolerance and they were roused to revolt by the receipt of a newspaper clipping sent by an anonymous hand enlarging on the fact that the clandestine meetings of a fashionable couple were being facilitated by the connivance of a long island chр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср ррірсрўср в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в

hot from the perusal of this paragraph sprang into the first train and laid the clipping before his fatherinlaw who chanced to be passing through town on his way from the hudson to the hot springs mr langhope ensconced in the cushioned privacy of the readingroom at the amsterdam club where he had invited his soninlaw to meet him perused the article with the cool eye of the collector to whom a new curiosity is offered i suppose he mused that in the time of the pharaohs the morning papyrus used to serve up this kind of thing and then as the nervous tension of his hearer expressed itself in an abrupt movement he added handing back the clipping with a smile what do you propose to do kill the editor and forbid blanche and bowfort the house i mean to do something amherst began suddenly chilled by the realization that his wrath had not yet shaped itself into a definite plan of action well it must be that or nothing said mr langhope drawing his stick meditatively across his knee and of course if its that youll land bessy in a devil of a mess without giving his soninlaw time to protest he touched rapidly but vividly on the inutility and embarrassment of libel suits and on the devices whereby the legal means of vindication from such attacks may be turned against those who have recourse to them and amherst listened with a sickened sense of the incompatibility between abstract standards of honour and their practical application what should you do then he murmured as mr langhope ended with his light shrug and a see tredegar if you dont believe me and his fatherinlaw replied with an evasive gesture why leave the responsibility where it belongs where it belongs to fenton carbury of course luckily its nobodys business but his and if he doesnt mind what is said about his wife i dont see how you can take up the cudgels for her without casting another shade on her somewhat chequered reputation amherst stared his wife what do i care whats said of her im thinking of mine well if carbury has no objection to his wifes meeting bowfort i dont see how you can object to her meeting him at your house in such matters as you know it has mercifully been decided that the husbands attitude shall determine other peoples otherwise we should be deprived of the legitimate pleasure of slandering our neighbours mr langhope was always careful to temper his explanations with an as you know he would have thought it illbred to omit this parenthesis in elucidating the social code to his soninlaw then you mean that i can do nothing amherst exclaimed mr langhope smiled what applies to carbury applies to you by doing nothing you establish the fact that theres nothing to do just as you create the difficulty by recognizing it and he added as amherst sat silent take bessy away and theyll have to see each other elsewhere amherst returned to lynbrook with the echoes of this casuistry in his brain it seemed to him but a part of the ingenious system of evasion whereby a society bent on the undisturbed pursuit of amusement had contrived to protect itself from the intrusion of the disagreeable a policy summed up in mr langhopes concluding advice that amherst should take his wife away yes that was wealths contemptuous answer to every challenge of responsibility duty sorrow and disgrace were equally to be evaded by a change of residence and nothing in life need be faced and fought out while one could pay for a passage to europe in a calmer mood amhersts sense of humour would have preserved him from such a view of his fatherinlaws advice but just then it fell like a spark on his smouldering prejudices he was clearsighted enough to recognize the obstacles to legal retaliation but this only made him the more resolved to assert his will in his own house he no longer paused to consider the possible effect of such a course on his already strained relations with his wife the mans will rose in him and spoke the scene between bessy and himself was short and sharp and it ended in a way that left him more than ever perplexed at the ways of her sex impatient of preamble he had opened the attack with his ultimatum the suspected couple were to be denied the house bessy flamed into immediate defence of her friend but to amhersts surprise she no longer sounded the note of her own rights husband and wife were animated by emotions deeperseated and more instinctive than had ever before confronted them yet while amhersts resistance was gathering strength from the conflict bessy unexpectedly collapsed in tears and submission she would do as he wished of course give up seeing blanche dismiss bowfort wash her hands in short of the imprudent pair in such matters a woman needed a mans guidance a wife must of necessity see with her husbands eyes and she looked up into his through a mist of penitence and admiration xxi in the first reaction from her brief delusion about stephen wyant justine accepted with a good grace the necessity of staying on at lynbrook though she was now well enough to return to her regular work her talk with amherst had made her feel that for the present she could be of more use by remaining with bessy and she was not sorry to have a farther period of delay and reflection before taking the next step in her life these at least were the reasons she gave herself for deciding not to leave and if any less ostensible lurked beneath they were not as yet visible even to her searching selfscrutiny at first she was embarrassed by the obligation of meeting dr wyant on whom her definite refusal had produced an effect for which she could not hold herself blameless she had not kept her promise of seeing him on the day after their encounter at the postoffice but had written instead in terms which obviously made such a meeting unnecessary but all her efforts to soften the abruptness of her answer could not conceal from either herself or her suitor that it was not the one she had led him to expect and she foresaw that if she remained at lynbrook she could not escape a scene of recrimination when the scene took place wyants part in it went far toward justifying her decision yet his vehement reproaches contained a sufficient core of truth to humble her pride it was lucky for her somewhat exaggerated sense of fairness that he overshot the mark by charging her with a coquetry of which she knew herself innocent and laying on her the responsibility for any follies to which her rejection might drive him such threats as a rule no longer move the feminine imagination yet justines pity for all forms of weakness made her recognize in the very heat of her contempt for wyant that his reproaches were not the mere cry of wounded vanity but the appeal of a nature conscious of its lack of recuperative power it seemed to her as though she had done him irreparable harm and the feeling might have betrayed her into too great a show of compassion had she not been restrained by a salutary fear of the result the state of bessys nerves necessitated frequent visits from her physician but justine on these occasions could usually shelter herself behind the professional reserve which kept even wyant from any open expression of feeling one day however they chanced to find themselves alone before bessys return from her ride the servant had ushered wyant into the library where justine was writing and when she had replied to his enquiries about his patient they found themselves face to face with an awkward period of waiting justine was too proud to cut it short by leaving the room but wyant answered her commonplaces at random stirring uneasily to and fro between window and fireside and at length halting behind the table at which she sat may i ask how much longer you mean to stay here he said in a low voice his eyes darkening under the sullen jut of the brows as she glanced up in surprise she noticed for the first time an odd contraction of his pupils and the discovery familiar enough in her professional experience made her disregard the abruptness of his question and softened the tone in which she answered i hardly know i suppose as long as i am needed wyant laughed needed by whom by john amherst a moment passed before justine took in the full significance of the retort then the blood rushed to her face yes i believe both mr and mrs amherst need me she answered keeping her eyes on his and wyant laughed again you didnt think so till amherst came back from hanaford his return seems to have changed your plans in several respects she looked away from him for even now his eyes moved her to pity and selfreproach dr wyant you are not well why do you wait to see mrs amherst she said he stared at her and then his glance fell im much obliged im as well as usual he muttered pushing the hair from his forehead with a shaking hand and at that moment the sound of bessys voice gave justine a pretext for escape in her own room she sank for a moment under a rush of selfdisgust but it soon receded before the saner forces of her nature leaving only a residue of pity for the poor creature whose secret she had surprised she had never before suspected wyant of taking a drug nor did she now suppose that he did so habitually but to see him even momentarily under such an influence explained her instinctive sense of his weakness she felt now that what would have been an insult on other lips was only a cry of distress from his and once more she blamed herself and forgave him but if she had been inclined to any morbidness of selfreproach she would have been saved from it by other cares for the moment she was more concerned with bessys fate than with her own her poor friend seemed to have so much more at stake and so much less strength to bring to the defence of her happiness justine was always saved from any excess of selfcompassion by the sense within herself of abounding forces of growth and selfrenewal as though from every lopped aspiration a fresh shoot of energy must spring but she felt that bessy had no such sources of renovation and that every disappointment left an arid spot in her soul even without her friends confidences justine would have had no difficulty in following the successive stages of the amhersts inner history she knew that amherst had virtually resigned his rule at westmore and that his wife in return for the sacrifice was trying to conform to the way of life she thought he preferred and the futility of both attempts was more visible to justine than to either of the two concerned she saw that the failure of the amhersts marriage lay not in any accident of outward circumstances but in the lack of all natural points of contact as she put it to herself they met neither underfoot nor overhead practical necessities united them no more than imaginative joys there were moments when justine thought amherst hard to bessy as she suspected that he had once been hard to his mother as the leader of men must perhaps always be hard to the hampering sex yet she did justice to his efforts to accept the irretrievable and to waken in his wife some capacity for sharing in his minor interests since she had none of her own with which to fill their days amherst had always been a reader not like justine herself a flamelike devourer of the page but a slow absorber of its essence and in the early days of his marriage he had fancied it would be easy to make bessy share this taste though his mother was not a bookish woman he had breathed at her side an air rich in allusion and filled with the bright presences of romance and he had always regarded this commerce of the imagination as one of the normal conditions of life the discovery that there were no books at lynbrook save a few morocco sets imprisoned behind the brass trellisings of the library had been one of the many surprises of his new state but in his first months with bessy there was no room for books and if he thought of the matter it was only in a glancing vision of future evenings when he and she in the calm afterglow of happiness should lean together over some cherished page her lack of response to any reference outside the small circle of daily facts had long since dispelled that vision but now that his own mind felt the need of inner sustenance he began to ask himself whether he might not have done more to rouse her imagination during the long evenings over the library fire he tried to lead the talk to books with a parenthesis now and again from the page beneath his eye and bessy met the experiment with conciliatory eagerness she showed in especial a hopeful but misleading preference for poetry leaning back with dreaming lids and lovely parted lips while he rolled out the immortal measures but her outward signs of attention never ripened into any expression of opinion or any afterallusion to what she heard and before long he discovered that justine brent was his only listener it was to her that the words he read began to be unconsciously addressed her comments directed him in his choice of subjects and the ensuing discussions restored him to some semblance of mental activity bessy true to her new rр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв

sense of recovered power over her he could not but note that the new phase in their relations had coincided with his first assertion of mastery and he rashly concluded that with the removal of the influences tending to separate them his wife might gradually be won back to her earlier sympathy with his views to accept this theory was to apply it for nothing could long divert amherst from his main purpose and all the thwarted strength of his will was only gathering to itself fresh stores of energy he had never been a skilful lover for no woman had as yet stirred in him those feelings which call the finer perceptions into play and there was no instinct to tell him that bessys sudden conformity to his wishes was as unreasoning as her surrender to his first kiss he fancied that he and she were at length reaching some semblance of that moral harmony which should grow out of the physical accord and that poor and incomplete as the understanding was it must lift and strengthen their relation he waited till early winter had brought solitude to lynbrook dispersing the hunting colony to various points of the compass and sending mr langhope to egypt and the riviera while mrs ansell as usual took up her annual tour of a social circuit whose extreme points were marked by boston and baltimore and then he made his final appeal to his wife his pretext for speaking was a letter from duplain definitely announcing his resolve not to remain at westmore a year earlier amherst deeply moved by the letter would have given it to his wife in the hope of its producing the same effect on her he knew better now he had learned her instinct for detecting business under every serious call on her attention his only hope as always was to reach her through the personal appeal and he put before her the fact of duplains withdrawal as the open victory of his antagonists but he saw at once that even this could not infuse new life into the question if i go back hell stay i can hold him can gain time till things take a turn he urged another i thought they were definitely settled she objected languidly no theyre not they cant be on such a basis amherst broke out with sudden emphasis he walked across the room and came back to her side with a determined face its a delusion a deception he exclaimed to think i can stand by any longer and see things going to ruin at westmore if ive made you think so ive unconsciously deceived us both as long as youre my wife weve only one honour between us and that honour is mine to take care of honour what an odd expression she said with a forced laugh and a little tinge of pink in her cheek you speak as if i had had made myself talked about when you know ive never even looked at another man another man amherst looked at her in wonder good god cant you conceive of any vow to be kept between husband and wife but the primitive one of bodily fidelity heaven knows ive never looked at another woman but by my reading of our compact i shouldnt be keeping faith with you if i didnt help you to keep faith with better things and you owe me the same help the same chance to rise through you and not sink by you else weve betrayed each other more deeply than any adultery could make us she had drawn back turning pale again and shrinking a little at the sound of words which except when heard in church she vaguely associated with oaths slammed doors and other evidences of illbreeding but amherst had been swept too far on the flood of his indignation to be checked by such small signs of disapproval youll say that what im asking you is to give me back the free use of your money well why not is it so much for a wife to give i know you all think that a man who marries a rich woman forfeits his selfrespect if he spends a penny without her approval but thats because money is so sacred to you all it seems to me the least important thing that a woman entrusts to her husband what of her dreams and her hopes her belief in justice and goodness and decency if he takes those and destroys them hed better have had a millstone about his neck but nobody has a word to say till he touches her dividends then hes a calculating brute who has married her for her fortune he had come close again facing her with outstretched hands halfcommanding half in appeal dont you see that i cant go on in this way that ive no right to let you keep me from westmore bessy was looking at him coldly under the halfdropped lids of indifference i hardly know what you mean you use such peculiar words but i dont see why you should expect me to give up all the ideas i was brought up in our standards are different but why should yours always be right you believed they were right when you married me have they changed since then no but her face seemed to harden and contract into a small expressionless mask in which he could no longer read anything but blank opposition to his will you trusted my judgment not long ago he went on when i asked you to give up seeing mrs carbury she flushed but with anger not compunction it seems to me that should be a reason for your not asking me to make other sacrifices when i gave up blanche i thought you would see that i wanted to please you and that you would do something for me in return amherst interrupted her with a laugh thank you for telling me your real reasons i was fool enough to think you acted from conviction not that you were simply striking a bargain he broke off and they looked at each other with a kind of fear each hearing between them the echo of irreparable words amhersts only clear feeling was that he must not speak again till he had beaten down the horrible sensation in his breast the rage of hate which had him in its grip and which made him almost afraid while it lasted to let his eyes rest on the fair weak creature before him bessy too was in the clutch of a mute anger which slowly poured its benumbing current around her heart strong waves of passion did not quicken her vitality she grew inert and cold under their shock only one little pulse of selfpity continued to beat in her trembling out at last on the cry ah i know its not because you care so much for westmore its only because you want to get away from me amherst stared as if her words had flashed a light into the darkest windings of his misery yes i want to get away he said and he turned and walked out of the room he went down to the smokingroom and ringing for a servant ordered his horse to be saddled the footman who answered his summons brought the afternoons mail and amherst throwing himself down on the sofa began to tear open his letters while he waited he ran through the first few without knowing what he read but presently his attention was arrested by the handwriting of a man he had known well in college and who had lately come into possession of a large cottonmill in the south he wrote now to ask if amherst could recommend a good manager not one of your old routine men but a young fellow with the new ideas things have been in pretty bad shape down here the writer added and now that im in possession i want to see what can be done to civilize the place and he went on to urge that amherst should come down himself to inspect the mills and propose such improvements as his experience suggested weve all heard of the great things youre doing at westmore the letter ended and amherst cast it from him with a groan it was duplains chance of coursethat was his first thought he took up the letter and read it over he knew the man who wrote no sentimentalist seeking emotional variety from vague philanthropic experiments but a serious student of social conditions now unexpectedly provided with the opportunity to apply his ideas yes it was duplains chance if indeed it might not be his own amherst sat upright dazzled by the thought why duplain why not himself bessy had spoken the illuminating word what he wanted was to get away to get away at any cost escape had become his one thought escape from the bondage of lynbrook from the bitter memory of his failure at westmore and here was the chance to escape back into life into independence activity and usefulness every atrophied faculty in him suddenly started from its torpor and his brain throbbed with the pain of the awakening the servant came to tell him that his horse waited and he sprang up took his ridingwhip from the rack stared a moment absently after the mans retreating back and then dropped down again on the sofa what was there to keep him from accepting his wifes affection was dead if her sentimental fancy for him had ever deserved the name and his passing mastery over her was gone too he smiled to remember that hardly two hours earlier he had been fatuous enough to think he could still regain it now he said to himself that she would sooner desert a friend to please him than sacrifice a fraction of her income and the discovery cast a stain of sordidness on their whole relation he could still imagine struggling to win her back from another man or even to save her from some folly into which mistaken judgment or perverted enthusiasm might have hurried her but to go on battling against the dull unimaginative subservience to personal luxury the slavery to houses and servants and clothes ah no while he had any fight left in him it was worth spending in a better cause than that through the open window he could hear in the mild december stillness his horses feet coming and going on the gravel her horse led up and down by her servant at the door of her house the sound symbolized his whole futurethe situation his marriage had made for him and to which he must henceforth bend unless he broke with it then and there he tried to look ahead to follow up one by one the consequences of such a break that it would be final he had no doubt there are natures which seem to be drawn closer by dissension to depend for the renewal of understanding on the spark of generosity and compunction that anger strikes out of both but amherst knew that between himself and his wife no such clearing of the moral atmosphere was possible the indignation which left him with tingling nerves and a burning need of some immediate escape into action crystallized in bessy into a hard kernel of obstinacy into which after each fresh collision he felt that a little more of herself had been absorbed no the break between them would be final if he went now he would not come back and it flashed across him that this solution might have been foreseen by his wife might even have been deliberately planned and led up to by those about her his fatherinlaw had never liked him the disturbing waves of his activity had rippled even the sheltered surface of mr langhopes existence he must have been horribly in their way well it was not too late to take himself out of it in bessys circle the severing of such ties was regarded as an expensive but unhazardous piece of surgery nobody bled to death of the wound the footman came back to remind him that his horse was waiting and amherst rose to his feet send him back to the stable he said with a glance at his watch and order a trap to take me to the next train xxii when amherst woke the next morning in the hotel to which he had gone up from lynbrook he was oppressed by the sense that the hardest step he had to take still lay before him it had been almost easy to decide that the moment of separation had come for circumstances seemed to have closed every other issue from his unhappy situation but how tell his wife of his decision amherst to whom action was the first necessity of being became a weak procrastinator when he was confronted by the need of writing instead of speaking to account for his abrupt departure from lynbrook he had left word that he was called to town on business but since he did not mean to return some farther explanation was now necessary and he was paralyzed by the difficulty of writing he had already telegraphed to his friend that he would be at the mills the next day but the southern express did not leave till the afternoon and he still had several hours in which to consider what he should say to his wife to postpone the dreaded task he invented the pretext of some business to be despatched and taking the subway to wall street consumed the morning in futile activities but since the renunciation of his work at westmore he had no active concern with the financial world and by twelve oclock he had exhausted his imaginary affairs and was journeying up town again he left the train at union square and walked along fourth avenue now definitely resolved to go back to the hotel and write his letter before lunching at twentysixth street he had struck into madison avenue and was striding onward with the fixed eye and aimless haste of the man who has empty hours to fill when a hansom drew up ahead of him and justine brent sprang out she was trimly dressed as if for travel with a small bag in her hand but at sight of him she paused with a cry of pleasure oh mr amherst im so glad i was afraid i might not see you for goodbye for goodbye amherst paused embarrassed how had she guessed that he did not mean to return to lynbrook you know she reminded him im going to some friends near philadelphia for ten days and he remembered confusedly that a long time ago probably yesterday morning he had heard her speak of her projected visit i had no idea she continued that you were coming up to town yesterday or i should have tried to see you before you left i wanted to ask you to send me a line if bessy needs me ill come back at once if she does amherst continued to listen blankly as if making a painful effort to regain some consciousness of what was being said to him and she went on she seemed so nervous and poorly yesterday evening that i was sorry i had decided to go her intent gaze reminded him that the emotions of the last twentyfour hours must still be visible in his face and the thought of what she might detect helped to restore his selfpossession you must not think of giving up your visit he began hurriedly he had meant to add on account of bessy but he found himself unable to utter his wifes name justine was still looking at him oh im sure everything will be all right she rejoined you go back this afternoon i suppose ive left you a little note with my address and i want you to promise she paused for amherst had made a motion as though to interrupt her the old confused sense that there must always be truth between them was struggling in him with the strong restraints of habit and character and suddenly before he was conscious of having decided to speak he heard himself say i ought to tell you that i am not going back not going back a flash of apprehension crossed justines face not till tomorrow you mean she added recovering herself amherst hesitated glancing vaguely up and down the street at that noonday hour it was nearly deserted and justines driver dozed on his perch above the hansom they could speak almost as openly as if they had been in one of the woodpaths at lynbrook nor tomorrow amherst said in a low voice there was another pause before he added it may be some time before he broke off and then continued with an effort the fact is i am thinking of going back to my old work she caught him up with an exclamation of surprise and sympathy your old work you mean at she was checked by the quick contraction of pain in his face not that i mean that im thinking of taking a new job as manager of a georgia mill its the only thing i know how to do and ive got to do something he forced a laugh the habit of work is incurable justines face had grown as grave as his she hesitated a moment looking down the street toward the angle of madison square which was visible from the corner where they stood will you walk back to the square with me then we can sit down a moment she began to move as she spoke and he walked beside her in silence till they had gained the seat she pointed out her hansom trailed after them drawing up at the corner as amherst sat down beside her justine turned to him with an air of quiet resolution mr amherst will you let me ask you something is this a sudden decision yes i decided yesterday and bessy his glance dropped for the first time but justine pressed her point bessy approves she she will i think when she knows when she knows her emotion sprang into her face when she knows then she does not yet no the offer came suddenly i must go at once without seeing her she cut him short with a quick commanding gesture mr amherst you cant do this you wont do it you will not go away without seeing bessy she said her eyes sought his and drew them upward constraining them to meet the full beam of her rebuking gaze i must do what seems best under the circumstances he answered hesitatingly she will hear from me of course i shall write today and later not later now you will go back now to lynbrook such things cant be told in writing if they must be said at all they must be spoken dont tell me that i dont understand or that im meddling in what doesnt concern me i dont care a fig for that ive always meddled in what didnt concern me i always shall i suppose till i die and i understand enough to know that bessy is very unhappy and that youre the wiser and stronger of the two i know what its been to you to give up your work to feel yourself useless she interrupted herself with softening eyes and i know how youve triedive watched youbut bessy has tried too and even if youve both failed if youve come to the end of your resources its for you to face the fact and help her face it not to run away from it like this amherst sat silent under the assault of her eloquence he was conscious of no instinctive resentment no sense that she was as she confessed meddling in matters which did not concern her his ebbing spirit was revived by the shock of an ardour like his own she had not shrunk from calling him a coward and it did him good to hear her call him so her words put life back into its true perspective restored their meaning to obsolete terms to truth and manliness and courage he had lived so long among equivocations that he had forgotten how to look a fact in the face but here was a woman who judged life by his own standards and by those standards she had found him wanting still he could not forget the last bitter hours or change his opinion as to the futility of attempting to remain at lynbrook he felt as strongly as ever the need of moral and mental liberation the right to begin life again on his own terms but justine brent had made him see that his first step toward selfassertion had been the inconsistent one of trying to evade its results you are right i will go back he said she thanked him with her eyes as she had thanked him on the terrace at lynbrook on the autumn evening which had witnessed their first broken exchange of confidences and he was struck once more with the change that feeling produced in her emotions flashed across her face like the sweep of sunrent clouds over a quiet landscape bringing out the gleam of hidden waters the fervour of smouldering colours all the subtle delicacies of modelling that are lost under the light of an open sky and it was extraordinary how she could infuse into a principle the warmth and colour of a passion if conduct to most people seemed a cold matter of social prudence or inherited habit to her it was always the newlydiscovered question of her own relation to life as most women see the great issues only through their own wants and prejudices so she seemed always to see her personal desires in the light of the larger claims but i dont think amherst went on that anything can be said to convince me that i ought to alter my decision these months of idleness have shown me that im one of the members of society who are a danger to the community if their noses are not kept to the grindstone justine lowered her eyes musingly and he saw she was undergoing the reaction of constraint which always followed on her bursts of unpremeditated frankness that is not for me to judge she answered after a moment but if you decide to go away for a time surely it ought to be in such a way that your going does not seem to cast any reflection on bessy or subject her to any unkind criticism amherst reddening slightly glanced at her in surprise i dont think you need fear that i shall be the only one criticized he said drily are you sure if you take such a position as you spoke of so few people understand the love of hard work for its own sake they will say that your quarrel with your wife has driven you to support yourself and that will be cruel to bessy amherst shrugged his shoulders theyll be more likely to say i tried to play the gentleman and failed and wasnt happy till i got back to my own place in life which is true enough he added with a touch of irony they may say that too but they will make bessy suffer first and it will be your fault if she is humiliated in that way if you decide to take up your factory work for a time cant you do so without without accepting a salary oh you see i stick at nothing she broke in upon herself with a laugh and bessy has said things which make me see that she would suffer horribly if if you put such a slight on her he remained silent and she went on urgently from bessys standpoint it would mean a decisive break the repudiating of your whole past and it is a question on which you can afford to be generous because i knowi thinkits less important in your eyes than hers amherst glanced at her quickly that particular form of indebtedness you mean she smiled the easiest to cancel and therefore the least galling isnt that the way you regard it i used to yes but he was about to add no one at lynbrook does but the flash of intelligence in her eyes restrained him while at the same time it seemed to answer theres my point to see their limitation is to allow for it since every enlightenment brings a corresponding obligation she made no attempt to put into words the argument her look conveyed but rose from her seat with a rapid glance at her watch and now i must go or i shall miss my train she held out her hand and as amhersts met it he said in a low tone as if in reply to her unspoken appeal i shall remember all you have said it was a new experience for amherst to be acting under the pressure of another will but during his return journey to lynbrook that afternoon it was pure relief to surrender himself to this pressure and the surrender brought not a sense of weakness but of recovered energy it was not in his nature to analyze his motives or spend his strength in weighing closely balanced alternatives of conduct and though during the last purposeless months he had grown to brood over every spring of action in himself and others this tendency disappeared at once in contact with the deed to be done it was as though a tributary stream gathering its crystal speed among the hills had been suddenly poured into the stagnant waters of his will and he saw now how thick and turbid those waters had become how full of the slimebred life that chokes the springs of courage his whole desire now was to be generous to his wife to bear the full brunt of whatever pain their parting brought justine had said that bessy seemed nervous and unhappy it was clear therefore that she also had suffered from the wounds they had dealt each other though she kept her unmoved front to the last poor child perhaps that insensible exterior was the only way she knew of expressing courage it seemed to amherst that all means of manifesting the finer impulses must slowly wither in the lynbrook air as he approached his destination his thoughts of her were all pitiful nothing remained of the personal resentment which had debased their parting he had telephoned from town to announce the hour of his return and when he emerged from the station he halfexpected to find her seated in the brougham whose lamps signalled him through the early dusk it would be like her to undergo such a reaction of feeling and to express it not in words but by taking up their relation as if there had been no break in it he had once condemned this facility of renewal as a sign of lightness a result of that continual evasion of serious issues which made the life of bessys world a thin crust of custom above a void of thought but he now saw that if she was the product of her environment that constituted but another claim on his charity and made the more precious any impulses of natural feeling that had survived the unifying pressure of her life as he approached the brougham he murmured mentally what if i were to try once more bessy had not come to meet him but he said to himself that he should find her alone at the house and that he would make his confession at once as the carriage passed between the lights on the tall stone gateposts and rolled through the bare shrubberies of the avenue he felt a momentary tightening of the heart a sense of stepping back into the trap from which he had just wrenched himself free a premonition of the way in which the smooth systematized routine of his wifes existence might draw him back into its revolutions as he had once seen a careless factory hand seized and dragged into a flying belt but it was only for a moment then his thoughts reverted to bessy it was she who was to be considered this time he must be strong enough for both the butler met him on the threshold flanked by the usual array of footmen and as he saw his portmanteau ceremoniously passed from hand to hand amherst once more felt the steel of the springe on his neck is mrs amherst in the drawingroom knowles he asked no sir said knowles who had too high a sense of fitness to volunteer any information beyond the immediate fact required of him she has gone up to her sittingroom then amherst continued turning toward the broad sweep of the stairway no sir said the butler slowly mrs amherst has gone away gone away amherst stopped short staring blankly at the mans smooth official mask this afternoon sir to mapleside to mapleside yes sir by motor to stay with mrs carbury there was a moments silence it had all happened so quickly that amherst with the dual vision which comes at such moments noticed that the third footman or was it the fourth was just passing his portmanteau on to a shirtsleeved arm behind the door which led to the servants wing he roused himself to look at the tall clock it was just six he had telephoned from town at two at what time did mrs amherst leave the butler meditated sharp at four sir the maid took the threeforty with the luggage with the luggage so it was not a mere onenight visit the blood rose slowly to amhersts face the footmen had disappeared but presently the door at the back of the hall reopened and one of them came out carrying an elaboratelyappointed teatray toward the smokingroom the routine of the house was going on as if nothing had happened the butler looked at amherst with respectful too respectful interrogation and he was suddenly conscious that he was standing motionless in the middle of the hall with one last intolerable question on his lips well it had to be spoken did mrs amherst receive my telephone message yes sir i gave it to her myself it occurred confusedly to amherst that a wellbred man as lynbrook understood the phrase would at this point have made some tardy feint of being in his wifes confidence of having on second thoughts no reason to be surprised at her departure it was humiliating he supposed to be thus laying bare his discomfiture to his dependents he could see that even knowles was affected by the manifest impropriety of the situation but no pretext presented itself to his mind and after another interval of silence he turned slowly toward the door of the smokingroom my letters are here i suppose he paused on the threshold to enquire and on the butlers answering in the affirmative he said to himself with a last effort to suspend his judgment she has left a line there will be some explanation but there was nothing neither word nor message nothing but the reverberating retort of her departure in the face of his return her flight to blanche carbury as the final answer to his final appeal xxiii justine was coming back to lynbrook she had been after all unable to stay out the ten days of her visit the undefinable sense of being needed so often the determining motive of her actions drew her back to long island at the end of the week she had received no word from amherst or bessy only cicely had told her in a big round hand that mother had been away three days and that it had been very lonely and that the housekeepers cat had kittens and she was to have one and were kittens christened or how did they get their names because she wanted to call hers justine and she had found in her book a bird like the one father had shown them in the swamp and they were not alone now because the telfers were there and they had all been out sleighing but it would be much nicer when justine came back it was as difficult to extract any sequence of facts from cicelys letter as from an early chronicle she made no reference to amhersts return which was odd since she was fond of her stepfather yet not significant since the fact of his arrival might have been crowded out by the birth of the kittens or some incident equally prominent in her perspectiveless grouping of events nor did she name the date of her mothers departure so that justine could not guess whether it had been contingent on amhersts return or wholly unconnected with it what puzzled her most was bessys own silence yet that too in a sense was reassuring for bessy thought of others chiefly when it was painful to think of herself and her not writing implied that she had felt no present need of her friends sympathy justine did not expect to find amherst at lynbrook she had felt convinced when they parted that he would persist in his plan of going south and the fact that the telfer girls were again in possession made it seem probable that he had already left under the circumstances justine thought the separation advisable but she was eager to be assured that it had been effected amicably and without open affront to bessys pride she arrived on a saturday afternoon and when she entered the house the sound of voices from the drawingroom and the prevailing sense of bustle and movement amid which her own coming was evidently an unconsidered detail showed that the normal life of lynbrook had resumed its course the telfers as usual had brought a lively throng in their train and amid the bursts of merriment about the drawingroom teatable she caught westy gainess impressive accents and the screaming laughter of blanche carbury so blanche carbury was back at lynbrook the discovery gave justine fresh cause for conjecture whatever reciprocal concessions might have resulted from amhersts return to his wife it seemed hardly probable that they included a renewal of relations with mrs carbury had his mission failed then had he and bessy parted in anger and was mrs carburys presence at lynbrook bessys retort to his assertion of independence in the schoolroom where justine was received with the eager outpouring of cicelys minutest experiences she dared not put the question that would have solved these doubts and she left to dress for dinner without knowing whether amherst had returned to lynbrook yet in her heart she never questioned that he had done so all her fears revolved about what had since taken place she saw bessy first in the drawingroom surrounded by her guests and their brief embrace told her nothing except that she had never beheld her friend more brilliant more triumphantly in possession of recovered spirits and health that amherst was absent was now made evident by bessys requesting westy gaines to lead the way to the diningroom with mrs ansell who was one of the reassembled visitors and the only one as justine presently observed not in key with the prevailing gaiety mrs ansell usually so tinged with the colours of her environment preserved on this occasion a grey neutrality of tone which was the only break in the general brightness it was not in her graceful person to express anything as gross as disapproval yet that sentiment was manifest to the nice observer in a delicate aloofness which made the waves of laughter fall back from her and spread a circle of cloudy calm about her end of the table justine had never been greatly drawn to mrs ansell her own adaptability was not in the least akin to the older womans studied selfeffacement and the independence of judgment which justine preserved in spite of her perception of divergent standpoints made her a little contemptuous of an excess of charity that seemed to have been acquired at the cost of all individual convictions tonight for the first time she felt in mrs ansell a secret sympathy with her own fears and a sense of this tacit understanding made her examine with sudden interest the face of her unexpected ally after all what did she know of mrs ansells history of the hidden processes which had gradually subdued her own passions and desires making of her as it were a mere decorative background a connecting link between other personalities perhaps for a woman alone in the world without the power and opportunity that money gives there was no alternative between letting ones individuality harden into a small dry nucleus of egoism or diffuse itself thus in the interstices of other lives and there fell upon justine the chill thought that just such a future might await her if she missed the liberating gift of personal happiness neither that night nor the next day had she a private word with bessy and it became evident as the hours passed that mrs amherst was deliberately postponing the moment when they should find themselves alone but the lynbrook party was to disperse on the monday and bessy who hated early rising and all the details of housekeeping tapped at justines door late on sunday night to ask her to speed the departing visitors she pleaded this necessity as an excuse for her intrusion and the playful haste of her manner showed a nervous shrinking from any renewal of confidence but as she leaned in the doorway fingering the diamond chain about her neck while one satintipped foot emerged restlessly from the edge of her lace gown her face lost the bloom of animation which talk and laughter always produced in it and she looked so pale and weary that justine needed no better pretext for drawing her into the room it was not in bessy to resist a soothing touch in her moments of nervous reaction she sank into the chair by the fire and let her head rest wearily against the cushion which justine slipped behind it justine dropped into the low seat beside her and laid a hand on hers you dont look as well as when i went away bessy are you sure youve done wisely in beginning your houseparties so soon it always alarmed bessy to be told that she was not looking her best and she sat upright a wave of pink rising under her sensitive skin i am quite well on the contrary but i was dying of inanition in this big empty house and i suppose i havent got the boredom out of my system yet justine recognized the echo of mrs carburys manner even if you were bored she rejoined the inanition was probably good for you what does dr wyant say to your breaking away from his rр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср

amherst laughed with gentle malice oh i havent seen dr wyant lately his interest in me died out the day you left justine forced a laugh to hide her annoyance she had not yet recovered from the shrinking disgust of her last scene with wyant dont be a goose bessy if he hasnt come it must be because youve told him not to because youre afraid of letting him see that youre disobeying him bessy laughed again my dear im afraid of nothing nothing not even of your big eyes when they glare at me like coals i suppose you must have looked at poor wyant like that to frighten him away and yet the last time we talked of him you seemed to like him you even hinted that it was because of him that westy had no chance justine uttered an impatient exclamation if neither of them existed it wouldnt affect the others chances in the least their only merit is that they both enhance the charms of celibacy bessys smile dropped and she turned a grave glance on her friend ah most men do that youre so clever to have found it out it was justines turn to smile oh but i havent as a generalization i mean to marry as soon as i get the chance the chance to meet the right man im gambler enough to believe in my luck yet mrs amherst sighed compassionately there is no right man as blanche says matrimonys as uncomfortable as a readymade shoe how can one and the same institution fit every individual case and why should we all have to go lame because marriage was once invented to suit an imaginary case justine gave a slight shrug you talk of walking lame how else do we all walk it seems to me that lifes the tight boot and marriage the crutch that may help one to hobble along she drew bessys hand into hers with a caressing pressure when you philosophize i always know youre tired no one who feels well stops to generalize about symptoms if you wont let your doctor prescribe for you your nurse is going to carry out his orders what you want is quiet be reasonable and send away everybody before mr amherst comes back she dropped the last phrase carelessly glancing away as she spoke but the stiffening of the fingers in her clasp sent a little tremor through her hand thanks for your advice it would be excellent but for one thing my husband is not coming back the mockery in bessys voice seemed to pass into her features hardening and contracting them as frost shrivels a flower justines face on the contrary was suddenly illuminated by compassion as though a light had struck up into it from the cold glitter of her friends unhappiness bessy what do you mean by not coming back i mean hes had the tact to see that we shall be more comfortable apart without putting me to the unpleasant necessity of telling him so again the piteous echo of blanche carburys phrases the laboured mimicry of her ideas justine looked anxiously at her friend it seemed horribly false not to mention her own talk with amherst yet she felt it wiser to feign ignorance since bessy could never be trusted to interpret rightly any departure from the conventional please tell me what has happened she said at length bessy with a smile released her hand john has gone back to the life he prefers which i take to be a hint to me to do the same justine hesitated again then the pressure of truth overcame every barrier of expediency bessy i ought to tell you that i saw mr amherst in town the day i went to philadelphia he spoke of going away for a timehe seemed unhappybut he told me he was coming back to see you first she broke off her clear eyes on her friends and she saw at once that bessy was too selfengrossed to feel any surprise at her avowal surely he came back she went on oh yes he came back bessy sank into the cushions watching the firelight play on her diamond chain as she repeated the restless gesture of lifting it up and letting it slip through her fingers well and then then nothing i was not here when he came you were not here what had happened i had gone over to blanche carburys for a day or two i was just leaving when i heard he was coming back and i couldnt throw her over at the last moment justine tried to catch the glance that fluttered evasively under bessys lashes you knew he was coming and you chose that time to go to mrs carburys i didnt choose my dear it just happened and it really happened for the best i suppose he was annoyed at my going you know he has a ridiculous prejudice against blanche and so the next morning he rushed off to his cotton mill there was a pause while the diamonds continued to flow in threads of fire through mrs amhersts fingers at length justine said did mr amherst know that you knew he was coming back before you left for mrs carburys bessy feigned to meditate the question did he know that i knew that he knew she mocked yes i suppose so he must have known she stifled a slight yawn as she drew herself languidly to her feet then he took that as your answer my answer to his coming back so it appears i told you he had shown unusual tact bessy stretched her softly tapering arms above her head and then dropped them along her sides with another yawn but its almost morning its wicked of me to have kept you so late when you must be up to look after all those people she flung her arms with a light gesture about justines shoulders and laid a dry kiss on her cheek dont look at me with those big eyes theyve eaten up the whole of your face and you neednt think im sorry for what ive done she declared im not the least little atom of a bit xxiv justine was pacing the long library at lynbrook between the caged sets of standard authors she felt as much caged as they as much a part of a conventional stagesetting totally unrelated to the action going on before it two weeks had passed since her return from philadelphia and during that time she had learned that her usefulness at lynbrook was over though not unwelcome she might almost call herself unwanted life swept by leaving her tethered to the stake of inaction a bitter lot for one who chose to measure existence by deeds instead of days she had found bessy ostensibly busy with a succession of guests no one in the house needed her but cicely and even cicely at times was caught up into the whirl of her mothers life swept off on sleighing parties and motortrips or carried to town for a dancingclass or an opera matinр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр

party had hastened back to his treadmill in wall street after a sunday spent in silently studying the files of the financial record but his wife stayed on somewhat aggressively in possession criticizing and rearranging the furniture ringing for the servants making sudden demands on the stable telegraphing telephoning ordering fires lighted or windows opened and leaving everywhere in her wake a trail of cigarette ashes and cocktail glasses ned bowfort had not been included in the houseparty but on the day of its dispersal he rode over unannounced for luncheon put up his horse in the stable threaded his way familiarly among the dozing dogs in the hall greeted mrs ansell and justine with just the right shade of quiet deference produced from his pocket a new puzzlegame for cicely and sat down beside her mother with the quiet urbanity of the family friend who knows his privileges but is too discreet to abuse them after that he came every day sometimes riding home late to the hunt club sometimes accompanying bessy and mrs carbury to town for dinner and the theatre but always with his deprecating air of having dropped in by accident and modestly hoping that his intrusion was not unwelcome the following sunday brought another influx of visitors and bessy seemed to fling herself with renewed enthusiasm into the cares of hospitality she had avoided justine since their midnight talk contriving to see her in cicelys presence or pleading haste when they found themselves alone the winter was unusually open and she spent long hours in the saddle when her time was not taken up with her visitors for a while she took cicely on her daily rides but she soon wearied of adapting her hunters stride to the pace of the little girls pony and cicely was once more given over to the coachmans care then came snow and a long frost and bessy grew restless at her imprisonment and grumbled that there was no way of keeping well in a winter climate which made regular exercise impossible why not build a squashcourt blanche carbury proposed and the two fell instantly to making plans under the guidance of ned bowfort and westy gaines as the scheme developed various advisers suggested that it was a pity not to add a bowlingalley a swimmingtank and a gymnasium a fashionable architect was summoned from town measurements were taken sites discussed sketches compared and engineers consulted as to the cost of artesian wells and the best system for heating the tank bessy seemed filled with a feverish desire to carry out the plan as quickly as possible and on as large a scale as even the architects invention soared to but it was finally decided that before signing the contracts she should run over to new jersey to see a building of the same kind on which a sporting friend of mrs carburys had recently lavished a fortune it was on this errand that the two ladies in company with westy gaines and bowfort had departed on the day which found justine restlessly measuring the length of the library she and mrs ansell had the house to themselves and it was hardly a surprise to her when in the course of the afternoon mrs ansell after a discreet pause on the threshold advanced toward her down the long room since the night of her return justine had felt sure that mrs ansell would speak but the elder lady was given to hawklike circlings about her subject to hanging over it and contemplating it before her wings dropped for the descent now however it was plain that she had resolved to strike and justine had a sense of relief at the thought she had been too long isolated in her anxiety her powerlessness to help and she had a vague hope that mrs ansells worldly wisdom might accomplish what her inexperience had failed to achieve shall we sit by the fire i am glad to find you alone mrs ansell began with the pleasant abruptness that was one of the subtlest instruments of her indirection and as justine acquiesced she added yielding her slight lines to the luxurious depths of an armchair i have been rather suddenly asked by an invalid cousin to go to europe with her next week and i cant go contentedly without being at peace about our friends she paused but justine made no answer in spite of her growing sympathy for mrs ansell she could not overcome an inherent distrust not of her methods but of her ultimate object what for instance was her conception of being at peace about the amhersts justines own conviction was that as far as their final welfare was concerned any terms were better between them than the external harmony which had prevailed during amhersts stay at lynbrook the subtle emanation of her distrust may have been felt by mrs ansell for the latter presently continued with a certain nobleness i am the more concerned because i believe i must hold myself in a small degree responsible for bessys marriage and as justine looked at her in surprise she added i thought she could never be happy unless her affections were satisfied and even now i believe so i believe so too justine said surprised into assent by the simplicity of mrs ansells declaration well then since we are agreed in our diagnosis the older woman went on smiling what remedy do you suggest or rather how can we administer it what remedy justine hesitated oh i believe we are agreed on that too mr amherst must be brought back but how to bring him she paused and then added with a singular effect of appealing frankness i ask you because i believe you to be the only one of bessys friends who is in the least in her husbands confidence justines embarrassment increased would it not be disloyal both to bessy and amherst to acknowledge to a third person a fact of which bessy herself was unaware yet to betray embarrassment under mrs ansells eyes was to risk giving it a dangerous significance bessy has spoken to me once or twice but i know very little of mr amhersts point of view except justine added after another moments weighing of alternatives that i believe he suffers most from being cut off from his work at westmore yes so i think but that is a difficulty that time and expediency must adjust all we can do their friends i mean is to get them together again before the breach is too wide justine pondered she was perhaps more ignorant of the situation than mrs ansell imagined for since her talk with bessy the latter had not again alluded to amhersts absence and justine could merely conjecture that he had carried out his plan of taking the management of the mill he had spoken of what she most wished to know was whether he had listened to her entreaty and taken the position temporarily without binding himself by the acceptance of a salary or whether wounded by the outrage of bessys flight he had freed himself from financial dependence by engaging himself definitely as manager i really know very little of the present situation justine said looking at mrs ansell bessy merely told me that mr amherst had taken up his old work in a cotton mill in the south as her eyes met mrs ansells it flashed across her that the latter did not believe what she said and the perception made her instantly shrink back into herself but there was nothing in mrs ansells tone to confirm the doubt which her look betrayed ah i hoped you knew more she said simply for like you i have only heard from bessy that her husband went away suddenly to help a friend who is reorganizing some mills in georgia of course under the circumstances such a temporary break is natural enough perhaps inevitable only he must not stay away too long justine was silent mrs ansells momentary selfbetrayal had checked all farther possibility of frank communion and the discerning lady had seen her error too late to remedy it but her hearers heart gave a leap of joy it was clear from what mrs ansell said that amherst had not bound himself definitely since he would not have done so without informing his wife and with a secret thrill of happiness justine recalled his last word to her i will remember all you have said he had kept that word and acted on it in spite of bessys last assault on his pride he had borne with her and deferred the day of final rupture and the sense that she had had a part in his decision filled justine with a glow of hope the consciousness of mrs ansells suspicions faded to insignificance mrs ansell and her kind might think what they chose since all that mattered now was that she herself should act bravely and circumspectly in her last attempt to save her friends i am not sure mrs ansell continued gently scrutinizing her companion that i think it unwise of him to have gone but if he stays too long bessy may listen to bad advice advice disastrous to her happiness she paused and turned her eyes meditatively toward the fire as far as i know she said with the same air of serious candour you are the only person who can tell him this i exclaimed justine with a leap of colour to her pale cheeks mrs ansells eyes continued to avoid her my dear miss brent bessy has told me something of the wise counsels you have given her mr amherst is also your friend as i said just now you are the only person

absorbed in the question as to how she could most effectually use whatever influence she possessed i put it to you as one old friend to another will you write to mr amherst to come back mrs ansell urged her justine was past considering even the strangeness of this request and its oblique reflection on the kind of power ascribed to her through the confused beatings of her heart she merely struggled for a clearer sense of guidance no she said slowly i cannot you cannot with a friends happiness in extremity mrs ansell paused a moment before she added unless you believe that bessy would be happier divorced divorced oh no justine shuddered that is what it will come to no no in time time is what i am most afraid of when blanche carbury disposes of it justine breathed a deep sigh youll write mrs ansell murmured laying a soft touch on her hand i have not the influence you think can you do any harm by trying i might justine faltered losing her exact sense of the words she used ah the other flashed back then you have influence why will you not use it justine waited a moment then her resolve gathered itself into words if i have any influence i am not sure it would be well to use it as you suggest not to urge mr amhersts return no not now she caught the same veiled gleam of incredulity under mrs ansells lids caught and disregarded it it must be now or never mrs ansell insisted i cant think so justine held out nevertheless will you try no no it might be fatal to whom to both she considered if he came back now i know he would not stay mrs ansell was upon her abruptly you know then you speak with authority no what authority i speak as i feel justine faltered the older woman drew herself to her feet ah then you shoulder a great responsibility she moved nearer to justine and once more laid a fugitive touch upon her you wont write to him no no the girl flung back and the voices of the returning party in the hall made mrs ansell with an almost imperceptible gesture of warning turn musingly away toward the fire bessy came back brimming with the wonders she had seen a glazed sunroom mosaic pavements a marble fountain to feed the marble tank and outside a watergarden descending in successive terraces to take up and utilize one could see how practically the overflow from the tank if one did the thing at all why not do it decently she had given up her new motor had let her town house had pinched and stinted herself in a hundred ways if ever woman was entitled to a little compensating pleasure surely she was that woman the days were crowded with consultations architect contractors engineers a landscape gardener and a dozen minor craftsmen came and went unrolled plans moistened pencils sketched figured argued persuaded and filled bessy with the dread of appearing under blanche carburys eyes subject to any restraining influences of economy what she was a young woman with an independent fortune and she was always wavering considering secretly referring back to the mute criticism of an invisible judge of the husband who had been first to shake himself free of any mutual subjection the accomplished blanche did not have to say this she conveyed it by the raising of painted brows by a smile of mocking interrogation a judiciously placed silence or a resigned glance at the architect so the estimates poured in were studied resisted then yielded to and signed then the hour of advance payments struck and an imperious appeal was despatched to mr tredegar to whom the management of bessys affairs had been transferred mr tredegar to his clients surprise answered the appeal in person he had not been lately to lynbrook dreading the cold and damp of the country in winter and his sudden arrival had therefore an ominous significance he came for an evening in midweek when even blanche carbury was absent and bessy and justine had the house to themselves mrs ansell had sailed the week before with her invalid cousin no farther words had passed between herself and justine but the latter was conscious that their talk had increased instead of lessened the distance between them justine herself meant to leave soon her hope of regaining bessys confidence had been deceived and seeing herself definitely superseded she chafed anew at her purposeless inactivity she had already written to one or two doctors in new york and to the matron of saint elizabeths she had made herself a name in surgical cases and it could not be long before a summons came meanwhile mr tredegar arrived and the three dined together the two women bending meekly to his discourse which was never more oracular and authoritative than when delivered to the gentler sex alone amhersts absence in particular seemed to loose the thin current of mr tredegars eloquence he was never quite at ease in the presence of an independent mind and justine often reflected that even had the two men known nothing of each others views there would have been between them an instinctive and irreducible hostility they would have disliked each other if they had merely jostled elbows in the street yet even freed from amhersts presence mr tredegar showed a darkling brow and as justine slipped away after dinner she felt that she left bessy to something more serious than the usual business conference how serious she was to learn that very night when in the small hours her friend burst in on her tearfully bessy was ruined ruined that was what mr tredegar had come to tell her she might have known he would not have travelled to lynbrook for a trifle she had expected to find herself cramped restricted to be warned that she must manage hateful word but this this was incredible unendurable there was no money to build the gymnasium none at all and all because it had been swallowed up at westmore because the ridiculous changes there the changes that nobody wanted nobody approved of that truscomb and all the other experts had opposed and derided from the first these changes even modified and arrested had already involved so much of her income that it might be years yes he said years before she would feel herself free again free of her own fortune of cicelys fortuneof the money poor dick westmore had meant his wife and child to enjoy justine listened anxiously to this confused outpouring of resentments bessys born incapacity for figures made it indeed possible that the facts came on her as a surprise that she had quite forgotten the temporary reduction of her income and had begun to imagine that what she had saved in one direction was hers to spend in another all this was conceivable but why had mr tredegar drawn so dark a picture of the future or was it only that thwarted of her immediate desire bessys disappointment blackened the farthest verge of her horizon justine though aware of her friends lack of perspective suspected that a conniving hand had helped to throw the prospect out of drawing could it be possible then that mr tredegar was among those who desired a divorce that the influences at which mrs ansell had hinted proceeded not only from blanche carbury and her group helpless amid this rush of forebodings justine could do no more than soothe and restrain to reason would have been idle she had never till now realized how completely she had lost ground with bessy the humiliation before my friends oh i was warnedmy father every onefor cicelys sake i was warnedbut i wouldnt listen and now from the first it was all he cared for in europe even he was always dragging me to factories me i was only the owner of westmore he wanted power power thats all when he lost it he left meoh im glad now my baby is dead glad theres nothing between us nothing nothing in the world to tie us together any longer the disproportion between this violent grief and its trivial cause would have struck justine as simply grotesque had she not understood that the incident of the gymnasium which followed with cumulative pressure on a series of similar episodes seemed to bessy like the reaching out of a retaliatory hand a mocking reminder that she was still imprisoned in the consequences of her unhappy marriage such folly seemed past weeping for it froze justines compassion into disdain till she remembered that the sources of our sorrow are sometimes nobler than their means of expression and that a baffled unappeased love was perhaps the real cause of bessys anger against her husband at any rate the moment was a critical one and justine remembered with a pang that mrs ansell had foreseen such a contingency and implored her to take measures against it she had refused from a sincere dread of precipitating a definite estrangement but had she been right in judging the situation so logically with a creature of bessys emotional uncertainties the result of contending influences was really incalculable it might still be that at this juncture amhersts return would bring about a reaction of better feelings justine sat and mused on these things after leaving her friend exhausted upon a tearful pillow she felt that she had perhaps taken too large a survey of the situation that the question whether there could ever be happiness between this tormented pair was not one to concern those who struggled for their welfare most marriages are a patchwork of jarring tastes and illassorted ambitions if here and there for a moment two colours blend two textures are the same so much the better for the pattern justine certainly could foresee in reunion no positive happiness for either of her friends but she saw positive disaster for bessy in separation from her husband suddenly she rose from her chair by the falling fire and crossed over to the writingtable she would write to amherst herself she would tell him to come the decision once reached hope flowed back to her heart the joy of action so often deceived her into immediate faith in its results dear mr amherst she wrote the last time i saw you you told me you would remember what i said i ask you to do so now to remember that i urged you not to be away too long i believe you ought to come back now though i know bessy will not ask you to i am writing without her knowledge but with the conviction that she needs you though perhaps without knowing it herself she paused and laid down her pen why did it make her so happy to write to him was it merely the sense of recovered helpfulness or something warmer more personal that made it a joy to trace his name and to remind him of their last intimate exchange of words well perhaps it was that too there were moments when she was so mortally lonely that any sympathetic contact with another life sent a glow into her veins that she was thankful to warm herself at any fire xxv bessy languidly glancing through her midday mail some five days later uttered a slight exclamation as she withdrew her fingertip from the flap of the envelope she had begun to open it was a black sleety day with an east wind bowing the trees beyond the drenched windowpanes and the two friends after luncheon had withdrawn to the library where justine sat writing notes for bessy while the latter lay back in her armchair in the state of dreamy listlessness into which she always sank when not under the stimulus of amusement or exercise she sat suddenly upright as her eyes fell on the letter i beg your pardon i thought it was for me she said holding it out to justine the latter reddened as she glanced at the superscription it had not occurred to her that amherst would reply to her appeal she had pictured him springing on the first northbound train perhaps not even pausing to announce his return to his wife and to receive his letter under bessys eye was undeniably embarrassing since justine felt the necessity of keeping her intervention secret but under bessys eye she certainly was it continued to rest on her curiously speculatively with an undergleam of malicious significance so stupid of me i cant imagine why i should have expected my husband to write to me bessy went on leaning back in lazy contemplation of her other letters but still obliquely including justine in her angle of vision the latter after a moments pause broke the seal and read millfield georgia my dear miss brent your letter reached me yesterday and i have thought it over carefully i appreciate the feeling that prompted it but i dont know that any friend however kind and discerning can give the final advice in such matters you tell me you are sure my wife will not ask me to return well under present conditions that seems to me a sufficient reason for staying away meanwhile i assure you that i have remembered all you said to me that day i have made no binding arrangement here nothing to involve my future action and i have done this solely because you asked it this will tell you better than words how much i value your advice and what strong reasons i must have for not following it now i suppose there are no more exploring parties in this weather i wish i could show cicely some of the birds down here yours faithfully john amherst please dont let my wife ride impulse latent under justines acute consciousness of what this letter meant was the sense of bessys inferences and conjectures she could feel them actually piercing the page in her hand like some hypersensitive visual organ to which matter offers no obstruction or rather baffled in their endeavour they were evoking out of the unseen heaven knew what fantastic structure of intrigue scrawling over the innocent page with burning evidences of perfidy and collusion one thing became instantly clear to her she must show the letter to bessy she ran her eyes over it again trying to disentangle the consequences there was the allusion to their talk in town well she had told bessy of that but the careless reference to their woodland excursions what might not bessy in her present mood make of it justines uppermost thought was of distress at the failure of her plan perhaps she might still have induced amherst to come back had it not been for this accident but now that hope was destroyed she raised her eyes and met bessys will you read it she said holding out the letter bessy received it with lifted brows and a protesting murmur but as she read justine saw the blood mount under her clear skin invade the temples the nape even the little flowerlike ears then it receded as suddenly ebbing at last from the very lips so that the smile with which she looked up from her reading was as white as if she had been under the stress of physical pain so you have written my husband to come back as you see bessy looked her straight in the eyes i am very much obliged to you extremely obliged justine met the look quietly which means that you resent my interference oh i leave you to call it that bessy mocked tossing the letter down on the table at her side bessy dont take it in that way if i made a mistake i did so with the hope of helping you how can i stand by after all these months together and see you deliberately destroying your life without trying to stop you the smile withered on bessys lips it is very dear and good of you i know youre never happy unless youre helping people but in this case i can only repeat what my husband says he and i dont often look at things in the same light but i quite agree with him that the management of such matters is best left to to the persons concerned justine hesitated i might answer that if you take that view it was inconsistent of you to talk with me so openly youve certainly made me feel that you wanted help youve turned to me for it but perhaps that does not justify my writing to mr amherst without your knowing it bessy laughed ah my dear you knew that if you asked me the letter would never be sent perhaps i did said justine simply i was trying to help you against your will well you see the result bessy laid a derisive touch on the letter do you understand now whose fault it is if i am alone justine faced her steadily there is nothing in mr amhersts letter to make me change my opinion i still think it lies with you to bring him back bessy raised a glittering face to her all hardness and laughter such modesty my dear as if i had a chance of succeeding where you failed she sprang up brushing the curls from her temples with a petulant gesture dont mind me if im cross but ive had a dose of preaching from maria ansell and i dont know why my friends should treat me like a puppet without any preferences of my own and press me upon a man who has done his best to show that he doesnt want me as a matter of fact he and i are luckily agreed on that point too and im afraid all the good advice in the world wont persuade us to change our opinion justine held her ground if i believed that of either of you i shouldnt have written i should not be pleading with you now and mr amherst doesnt believe it either she added after a pause conscious of the risk she was taking but thinking the words might act like a blow in the face of a person sinking under a deadly narcotic bessys smile deepened to a sneer i see youve talked me over thoroughly and on his views i ought perhaps not to have risked an opinion we have not talked you over justine exclaimed mr amherst could never talk of youin the way you think and under the light staccato of bessys laugh she found resolution to add it is not in that way that i know what he feels ah i should be curious to hear then justine turned to the letter which still lay between them will you read the last sentence again the postscript i mean bessy after a surprised glance at her took the letter up with the deprecating murmur of one who acts under compulsion rather than dispute about a trifle the postscript let me seedont let my wife ride impulse et puis she murmured dropping the page again well does it tell you nothing its a cold letter at first i thought so the letter of a man who believes himself deeply hurt so deeply that he will make no advance no sign of relenting thats what i thought when i first read itbut the postscript undoes it all justine as she spoke had drawn near bessy laying a hand on her arm and shedding on her the radiance of a face all charity and sweet compassion it was her rare gift at such moments to forget her own relation to the person for whose fate she was concerned to cast aside all consciousness of criticism and distrust in the heart she strove to reach as pitiful people forget their physical timidity in the attempt to help a wounded animal for a moment bessy seemed to waver the colour flickered faintly up her cheek her long lashes drooped she had the tenderest lids and all her face seemed melting under the beams of justines ardour but the letter was still in her hand her eyes in sinking fell upon it and she sounded beneath her breath the fatal phrase i have done this solely because you asked it after such a tribute to your influence i dont wonder you feel competent to set everybodys affairs in order but take my advice my dear dont ask me not to ride impulse the pity froze on justines lip she shrank back cut to the quick for a moment the silence between the two women rang with the flight of arrowy wounding thoughts then bessys anger flagged she gave one of her embarrassed halflaughs and turning back laid a deprecating touch on her friends arm i didnt mean that justinebut let us not talk now i cant justine did not move the reaction could not come as quickly in her case but she turned on bessy two eyes full of pardon full of speechless pityand bessy received the look silently before she moved to the door and went out oh poor thing poor thing justine gasped as the door closed she had already forgotten her own hurt she was alone again with bessys sterile pain she stood staring before her for a moment then her eyes fell on amhersts letter which had fluttered to the floor between them the fatal letter if it had not come at that unlucky moment perhaps she might still have gained her end she picked it up and reread it yes there were phrases in it that a wounded suspicious heart might misconstrue yet bessys last words had absolved her why had she not answered them why had she stood there dumb the blow to her pride had been too deep had been dealt too unexpectedly for one miserable moment she had thought first of herself ah that importunate irrepressible self the moi haр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р вђрв р в р вђ р в рірср ррірсрўср в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в

cold whispers of vanity of selfishness of worldly pride might have drawn their freezing ring about bessys heart justine started up to follow herthen paused recalling her last words let us not talk now i cant she had no right to intrude on that bleeding privacy if the chance had been hers she had lost it she dropped back into her seat at the desk hiding her face in her hands presently she heard the clock strike and true to her tireless instinct of activity she lifted her head took up her pen and went on with the correspondence she had dropped it was hard at first to collect her thoughts or even to summon to her pen the conventional phrases that sufficed for most of the notes groping for a word she pushed aside her writing and stared out at the sallow frozen landscape framed by the window at which she sat the sleet had ceased and hollows of sunless blue showed through the driving windclouds a hard sky and a hard ground frostbound ringing earth under rigid icemailed trees as justine looked out shivering a little she saw a womans figure riding down the avenue toward the gate the figure disappeared behind a clump of evergreens showed again farther down through the boughs of a skeleton beech and revealed itself in the next open space as bessy bessy in the saddle on a day of glaring frost when no horse could keep his footing out of a walk justine went to the window and strained her eyes for a confirming glimpse yes it was bessy there was no mistaking that light flexible figure every line swaying true to the beat of the horses stride but justine remembered that bessy had not meant to ride had countermanded her horse because of the bad going well she was a perfect horsewoman and had no doubt chosen her surestfooted mountprobably the brown cob tony lumpkin but when did tonys sides shine so bright through the leafless branches and when did he sweep his rider on with such long free play of the hindquarters horse and rider shot into sight again rounding the curve of the avenue near the gates and in a break of sunlight justine saw the glitter of chestnut flanks and remembered that impulse was the only chestnut in the stables she went back to her seat and continued writing bessy had left a formidable heap of bills and letters and when this was demolished justine had her own correspondence to despatch she had heard that morning from the matron of saint elizabeths an interesting case was offered her but she must come within two days for the first few hours she had wavered loath to leave lynbrook without some definite light on her friends future but now amhersts letter had shed that light or rather had deepened the obscurity and she had no pretext for lingering on where her uselessness had been so amply demonstrated she wrote to the matron accepting the engagement and the acceptance involved the writing of other letters the general reorganizing of that minute polity the life of justine brent she smiled a little to think how easily she could be displaced and transplanted how slender were her material impedimenta how few her invisible bonds she was as light and detachable as a dead leaf on the autumn breeze yet she was in the season of sap and flower when there is life and song in the trees but she did not think long of herself for an undefinable anxiety ran through her thoughts like a black thread it found expression now and then in the long glances she threw through the window in her rising to consult the clock and compare her watch with it in a nervous snatch of humming as she paced the room once or twice before going back to her desk why was bessy so late dusk was falling already the early end of the cold slatehued day but bessy always rode late there was always a rational answer to justines irrational conjectures it was the sight of those chestnut flanks that tormented her she knew of bessys previous struggles with the mare but the indulging of idle apprehensions was not in her nature and when the teatray came and with it cicely sparkling from a gusty walk and coralpink in her cloud of crinkled hair justine sprang up and cast off her cares it cost her a pang again to see the lamps lit and the curtains drawn shutting in the warmth and brightness of the house from that windswept frozen twilight through which bessy rode alone but the icy touch of the thought slipped from justines mind as she bent above the teatray gravely measuring cicelys milk into a grownup teacup hearing the confidential details of the childs day and capping them with banter and fantastic narrative she was not sorry to go ah no the house had become a prison to her with ghosts walking its dreary floors but to lose cicely would be bitter she had not felt how bitter till the child pressed against her in the firelight insisting raptly with little sharp elbows stabbing her knee and then what happened justine the door opened and some one came in to look at the fire justine through the mazes of her fairytale was dimly conscious that it was knowles and not one of the footmenthe proud knowles who never mended the fires himself as he passed out again hovering slowly down the long room she rose leaving cicely on the hearthrug and followed him to the door has mrs amherst not come in she asked not knowing why she wished to ask it out of the childs hearing no miss i looked in myself to see thinking she might have come by the sidedoor she may have gone to her sittingroom shes not upstairs they both paused then justine said what horse was she riding impulse miss the butler looked at his large responsible watch its not late he said more to himself than to her no has she been riding impulse lately no miss not since that day the mare nearly had her off i understood mr amherst did not wish it justine went back to cicely and the fairytale as she took up the thread of the princesss adventures she asked herself why she had ever had any hope of helping bessy the seeds of disaster were in the poor creatures soul even when she appeared to be moved lifted out of herself her escaping impulses were always dragged back to the magnetic centre of hard distrust and resistance that sometimes forms the core of softfibred natures as she had answered her husbands previous appeal by her flight to the woman he disliked so she answered this one by riding the horse he feared justines last illusions crumbled the distance between two such natures was unspannable amherst had done well to remain awayand with a tidal rush her sympathies swept back to his side the governess came to claim cicely one of the footmen came to put another log on the fire then the rite of removing the teatable was majestically performed the ceremonial that had so often jarred on amhersts nerves as she watched it justine had a vague sense of the immutability of the household routine a queer awed feeling that whatever happened a machine so perfectly adjusted would work on inexorably like a natural law she rose to look out of the window staring vainly into blackness between the parted curtains as she turned back passing the writingtable she noticed that cicelys irruption had made her forget to post her letters an unusual oversight a glance at the clock told her that she was not too late for the mail reminding her at the same time that it was scarcely three hours since bessy had started on her ride she saw the foolishness of her fears even in winter bessy often rode for more than three hours and now that the days were growing longer suddenly reassured justine went out into the hall intending to carry her batch of letters to the red pillarbox by the door as she did so a cold blast struck her could it be that for once the faultless routine of the house had been relaxed that one of the servants had left the outer door ajar she walked over to the vestibule yes both doors were wide the night rushed in on a vicious wind as she pushed the vestibule door shut she heard the dogs sniffing and whining on the threshold she crossed the vestibule and heard voices and the tramping of feet in the darkness then saw a lantern gleam suddenly knowles shot out of the night the lantern struck on his bleached face justine stepping back pressed the electric button in the wall and the wide doorstep was abruptly illuminated with its huddled pushing heavilybreathing groupblack figures writhing out of darkness strange faces distorted in the glare bessy she cried and sprang forward but suddenly wyant was before her his hand on her arm and as the dreadful group struggled by into the hall he froze her to him with a whisper the spine xxvi within justine there was a moments darkness then like terrorstruck workers rallying to their tasks every faculty was again at its post receiving and transmitting signals taking observations anticipating orders making her brain ring with the hum of a controlled activity she had known the sensation before the transmuting of terror and pity into this miraculous lucidity of thought and action but never had it snatched her from such depths oh thank heaven for her knowledge now for the trained mind that could take command of her senses and bend them firmly to its service wyant seconded her well after a moments aguefit of fear she pitied and pardoned the moment aware of its cause and respecting him for the way in which he rose above it into the clear air of professional selfcommand through the first hours they worked shoulder to shoulder conscious of each other only as of kindred willpowers stretched to the utmost tension of discernment and activity and hardly needing speech or look to further their swift cooperation it was thus that she had known him in the hospital in the heat of his youthful zeal the doctor she liked best to work with because no other so tempered ardour with judgment the great surgeon arriving from town at midnight confirmed his diagnosis there was undoubted injury to the spine other consultants were summoned in haste and in the winter dawn the verdict was pronounced a fractured vertebra and possibly lesion of the cord justine got a moment alone when the surgeons returned to the sickroom other nurses were there now capped aproned quickly and silently unpacking their appliances she must call a halt clear her brain again decide rapidly what was to be done next oh if only the crawling hours could bring amherst it was strange that there was no telegram yet no not strange after all since it was barely six in the morning and her message had not been despatched till seven the night before it was not unlikely that in that little southern settlement the telegraph office closed at six she stood in bessys sittingroom her forehead pressed to the windowpane her eyes straining out into the thin february darkness through which the morning star swam white as soon as she had yielded her place to the other nurses her nervous tension relaxed and she hung again above the deeps of anguish terrified and weak in a moment the necessity for action would snatch her back to a firm footing her thoughts would clear her will affirm itself all the wheels of the complex machine resume their functions but now she felt only the horror she knew so well what was going on in the next room dr garford the great surgeon who had known her at saint elizabeths had evidently expected her to take command of the nurses he had brought from town but there were enough without her and there were other cares which for the moment she only could assume the despatching of messages to the scattered family the incessant telephoning and telegraphing to town the general guidance of the household swinging rudderless in the tide of disaster cicely above all must be watched over and guarded from alarm the little governess reduced to a twittering heap of fears had been quarantined in a distant room till reason returned to her and the child meanwhile slept quietly in the old nurses care cicely would wake presently and justine must go up to her with a bright face other duties would press thick on the heels of this their feet were already on the threshold but meanwhile she could only follow in imagination what was going on in the other room she had often thought with dread of such a contingency she always sympathized too much with her patients she knew it was the joint in her armour her quickgushing pity lay too near that professional exterior which she had managed to endue with such a bright glaze of insensibility that some sentimental patients without much the matter had been known to call her a little hard how then should she steel herself if it fell to her lot to witness a cruel accident to some one she loved and to have to perform a nurses duties steadily expertly unflinchingly while every fibre was torn with inward anguish she knew the horror of it now and she knew also that her selfenforced exile from the sickroom was a hundred times worse to stand there knowing with each tick of the clock what was being said and done within how the great luxurious room with its pale draperies and scented cushions and the hundred pretty trifles strewing the lace toilettable and the delicate old furniture was being swept bare cleared for action like a ships deck drearily garnished with rows of instruments rolls of medicated cotton oiled silk bottles bandages waterpillows all the grim paraphernalia of the awful rites of pain to know this and to be able to call up with torturing vividness that poor pale face on the pillows vagueeyed expressionless perhaps as she had last seen it or worse yet stirred already with the first creeping pangs of consciousness to have these images slowly deliberately burn themselves into her brain and to be aware at the same time of that underlying moral disaster of which the accident seemed the monstrous outward symbol ah this was worse than anything she had ever dreamed she knew that the final verdict could not be pronounced till the operation which was about to take place should reveal the extent of injury to the spine bessy in falling must have struck on the back of her head and shoulders and it was but too probable that the fractured vertebra had caused a bruise if not a lesion of the spinal cord in that case paralysis was certain and a slow crawling death the almost inevitable outcome there had been cases of course justines professional memory evoked them cases of socalled recovery where actual death was kept at bay a semblance of life preserved for years in the poor petrified body but the mind shrank from such a fate for bessy and it might still be that the injury to the spine was not grave though here again the fracturing of the fourth vertebra was ominous the door opened and some one came from the inner room wyant in search of an instrumentcase justine turned and they looked at each other it will be now yes dr garford asked if there was no one you could send for no one but mr tredegar and the halford gaineses theyll be here this evening i suppose they exchanged a discouraged glance knowing how little difference the presence of the halford gaineses would make he wanted to know if there was no telegram from amherst no then they mean to begin a nursemaid appeared in the doorway miss cicely she said and justine bounded upstairs the days work had begun from cicely to the governess from the governess to the housekeeper from the telephone to the writingtable justine vibrated back and forth quick noiseless selfpossessed sobering guiding controlling her confused and panicstricken world it seemed to her that half the day had elapsed before the telegraph office at lynbrook opened she was at the telephone at the stroke of the hour no telegram only one a message from halford gaines arrive at eight tonight amherst was still

whom to turn to loose the telfer tribe and mrs carbury upon that stricken house her thought revolted from it and she was thankful to know that february had dispersed their migratory flock to southern shores but if only amherst would come cicely and the tranquillized governess had been despatched on a walk with the dogs and justine was returning upstairs when she met one of the servants with a telegram she tore it open with a great throb of relief it was her own message to amherst address unknown had she misdirected it then in that first blinding moment her mind might so easily have failed her but no there was the name of the town before hermillfield georgiathe same name as in his letter she had made no mistake but he was gone gone and without leaving an address for a moment her tired mind refused to work then she roused herself ran down the stairs again and rang up the telegraphoffice the thing to do of course was to telegraph to the owner of the mills of whose very name she was ignorant enquiring where amherst was and asking him to forward the message precious hours must be lost meanwhile but after all they were waiting for no one upstairs the verdict had been pronounced dislocation and fracture of the fourth vertebra with consequent injury to the spinal cord dr garford and wyant came out alone to tell her the surgeon ran over the technical details her brain instantly at attention as he developed his diagnosis and issued his orders she asked no questions as to the future she knew it was impossible to tell but there were no immediate signs of a fatal ending the patient had rallied well and the general conditions were not unfavourable you have heard from mr amherst dr garford concluded not yethe may be travelling justine faltered unwilling to say that her telegram had been returned as she spoke there was a tap on the door and a folded paper was handed in a telegram telephoned from the village amherst gone south america to study possibilities cotton growing have cabled our correspondent buenos ayres concealment was no longer possible justine handed the message to the surgeon ah and there would be no chance of finding his address among mrs amhersts papers i think not no well we must keep her alive wyant yes sir at dusk justine sat in the library waiting for cicely to be brought to her a lull had descended on the house a new order developed out of the mornings chaos with soundless steps with lowered voices the machinery of life was carried on and justine caught in one of the pauses of inaction which she had fought off since morning was reliving for the hundredth time her few moments at bessys bedside she had been summoned in the course of the afternoon and stealing into the darkened room had bent over the bed while the nurses noiselessly withdrew there lay the white face which had been burnt into her inward vision the motionless body and the head stirring ceaselessly as though to release the agitation of the imprisoned limbs bessys eyes turned to her drawing her down am i going to die justine no the pain isso awful it will passyou will sleep cicely she has gone for a walk youll see her presently the eyes faded releasing justine she stole away and the nurses came back bessy had spoken of cicely but not a word of her husband perhaps her poor dazed mind groped for him or perhaps it shrank from his name justine was thankful for her silence for the moment her heart was bitter against amherst why so soon after her appeal and his answer had he been false to the spirit of their agreement this unannounced unexplained departure was nothing less than a breach of his tacit pledge the pledge not to break definitely with lynbrook and why had he gone to south america she drew her aching brows together trying to retrace a vague memory of some allusion to the cottongrowing capabilities of the region yes he had spoken of it once in talking of the worlds area of cotton production but what impulse had sent him off on such an exploration mere unrest perhaps the intolerable burden of his useless life the questions spun round and round in her head weary profitless yet persistent it was a relief when cicely came a relief to measure out the cambric tea to make the terrier beg for gingerbread even to take up the thread of the interrupted fairytale though through it all she was wrung by the thought that just twentyfour hours earlier she and the child had sat in the same place listening for the trot of bessys horse the day passed the hands of the clocks moved food was cooked and served blinds were drawn up or down lamps lit and fires renewedall these tokens of the passage of time took place before her while her real consciousness seemed to hang in some dim central void where nothing happened nothing would ever happen and now cicely was in bed the last longdistance call was answered the last orders to kitchen and stable had been despatched wyant had stolen down to her with his hourly report no change and she was waiting in the library for the gaineses carriagewheels on the gravel they were there at last justine started up and went into the hall as she passed out of the library the outer door opened and the gusty night swooped in as at the same hour the day before it had swooped in ahead of the dreadful procession preceding now the carriageful of hanaford relations mr gaines redglazed brief and interrogatory westy small nervous ill at ease with his grief and mrs gaines supreme in the possession of a consolatory yet funereal manner and sinking on justines breast with the solemn whisper have you sent for the clergyman xxvii the house was empty again a week had passed since bessys accident and friends and relations had dispersed the household had fallen into its routine the routine of sickness and silence and once more the perfectlyadjusted machine was working on steadily inexorably like a natural law so at least it seemed to justines nerves intolerably stretched at times on the rack of solitude of suspense of forebodings she had been thankful when the gaineses left doubly thankful when a telegram from bermuda declared mrs carbury to be in despair at her inability to fly to bessys side thankful even that mr tredegars professional engagements made it impossible for him to do more than come down every second or third day for a few hours yet though in some ways it was a relief to be again in sole command there were moments when the weight of responsibility and the inability to cry out her fears and her uncertainties seemed almost unendurable wyant was her chief reliance he had risen so gallantly above his weakness become again so completely the indefatigable worker of former days that she accused herself of injustice in ascribing to physical causes the vague eye and tremulous hand which might merely have betokened a passing access of nervous sensibility now at any rate he had his nerves so well under control and had shown such a grasp of the case and such marked executive capacity that on the third day after the accident dr garford withdrawing his own assistant had left him in control at lynbrook at the same time justine had taken up her attendance in the sickroom replacing one of the subordinate nurses who had been suddenly called away she had done this the more willingly because bessy who was now conscious for the greater part of the time had asked for her once or twice and had seemed easier when she was in the room but she still gave only occasional aid relieving the other nurses when they dined or rested but keeping herself partly free in order to have an eye on the household and give a few hours daily to cicely all this had become part of a system that already seemed as old as memory she could hardly recall what life had been before the accident the seven dreadful days seemed as long as the days of creation every morning she rose to the same report no change and every day passed without a word from amherst minor news of course had come poor mr langhope at length overtaken at wady halfa was hastening back as fast as ship and rail could carry him mrs ansell anchored at algiers with her invalid cabled anxious enquiries but still no word from amherst the correspondent at buenos ayres had simply cabled not here will enquire and since then silence justine had taken to sitting in a small room beyond amhersts bedroom near enough to bessy to be within call yet accessible to the rest of the household the walls were hung with old prints and with two or three photographs of early italian pictures and in a low bookcase amherst had put the books he had brought from hanaford the english poets the greek dramatists some textbooks of biology and kindred subjects and a few stray wellworn volumes leckys european morals carlyles translation of wilhelm meister seneca epictetus a german grammar a pocket bacon it was unlike any other room at lynbrook even through her benumbing misery justine felt the relief of escaping there from the rest of the great soulless house sometimes she took up one of the books and read a page or two letting the beat of the verse lull her throbbing brain or the strong words of stoic wisdom sink into her heart and even when there was no time for these brief flights from reality it soothed her to feel herself in the presence of great thoughts to know that in this room among these books another restless baffled mind had sought escape from the dusty answer of life her hours there made her think less bitterly of amherst but also alas made her see more clearly the irreconcilable difference between the two natures she had striven to reunite that which was the essence of life to one was a meaningless shadow to the other and the gulf between them was too wide for the imagination of either to bridge as she sat there on the seventh afternoon there was a knock on the door and wyant entered she had only time to notice that he was very pale she had been struck once or twice with his look of sudden exhaustion which passed as quickly as it came then she saw that he carried a telegram and her mind flew back to its central anxiety she grew pale herself as she read the message he has been found at corrientes it will take him at least a month to get here a month good god and it may take mr langhope longer their eyes met its too long she asked i dont know i dont know he shivered slightly turning away into the window justine sat down to dash off messages to mr tredegar and the gaineses amhersts return must be made known at once when she glanced up wyant was standing near her his air of intense weariness had passed and he looked calm and ready for action shall i take these down no ring please i want to ask you a few questions the servant who answered the bell brought in a teatray and justine having despatched the telegrams seated herself and began to pour out her tea food had been repugnant to her during the first anguished unsettled days but with the resumption of the nurses systematic habits the nurses punctual appetite returned every drop of energy must be husbanded now and only sleep and nourishment could fill the empty cisterns she held out a cup to wyant but he drew back with a gesture of aversion thanks im not hungry you ought to eat more no no im very well she lifted her head revived by the warm draught the mechanical act of nourishment performed her mind leapt back to the prospect of amhersts return a whole month before he reached lynbrook he had instructed her where news might find him on the way but a whole month to wait she looked at wyant and they read each others thoughts its a long time he said yes but garford can do wonders and shes very strong justine shuddered just so a skilled agent of the inquisition might have spoken calculating how much longer the power of suffering might be artificially preserved in a body broken on the wheel how does she seem to you today the general conditions are about the same the heart keeps up wonderfully but there is a little more oppression of the diaphragm yes her breathing is harder last night she suffered horribly at times oh shell suffer wyant murmured of course the hypodermics can be increased just what did dr garford say this morning he is astonished at her strength but theres no hope i dont know why i ask hope wyant looked at her you mean of whats called recovery of deferring death indefinitely she nodded how can garford tell or any one we all know there have been cases where such injury to the cord has not caused death this may be one of those cases but the biggest man couldnt say now justine hid her eyes what a fate recovery yes keeping people alive in such cases is one of the refinements of cruelty that it was left for christianity to invent and yet and yet its got to be science herself says so not for the patient of course but for herself for unborn generations rather queer isnt it the two creeds are at one justine murmured through her clasped hands i wish she were not so strong yes its wonderful what those frail petted bodies can stand the fight is going to be a hard one she rose with a shiver i must go to cicely the rector of saint annes had called again justine in obedience to mrs gainess suggestion had summoned him from clifton the day after the accident but supported by the surgeons and wyant she had resisted his admission to the sickroom bessys religious practices had been purely mechanical her faith had never been associated with the graver moments of her life and the apparition of a clerical figure at her bedside would portend not consolation but calamity since it was allimportant that her nervous strength should be sustained and the gravity of the situation kept from her mrs gaines yielded to the medical commands consoled by the ready acquiescence of the rector but before she left she extracted a promise that he would call frequently at lynbrook and wait his opportunity to say an uplifting word to mrs amherst the reverend ernest lynde who was a young man with more zeal than experience deemed it his duty to obey this injunction to the letter but hitherto he had had to content himself with a talk with the housekeeper or a brief word on the doorstep from wyant today however he had asked somewhat insistently for miss brent and justine who was free at the moment felt that she could not refuse to go down she had seen him only in the pulpit when once or twice in bessys absence she had taken cicely to church he struck her as a grave young man with a fine voice but halting speech his sermons were earnest but ineffective as he rose to meet her she felt that she should like him better out of church his glance was clear and honest and there was sweetness in his hesitating smile i am sorry to seem persistent but i heard you had news of mr langhope and i was anxious to know the particulars he explained justine replied that her message had overtaken mr langhope at wady haifa and that he hoped to reach alexandria in time to catch a steamer to brindisi at the end of the week not till then so it will be almost three weeks as nearly as i can calculate a month the rector hesitated and mr amherst he is coming back too ah you have heard im glad of that he will be here soon no he is in south america at buenos ayres there will be no steamer for some days and he may not get here till after mr langhope mr lynde looked at her kindly with grave eyes that proffered help this is terrible for you miss brent yes justine answered simply and mrs amhersts condition it is about the same the doctors are hopeful they have not lost hope she seems to keep her strength wonderfully yes wonderfully mr lynde paused looking downward and awkwardly turning his soft clerical hat in his large kindlooking hands one might almost see in it a dispensation we should see one miss brent we she glanced up apologetically not quite sure that her tired mind had followed his meaning we i mean who believethat not one sparrow falls to the ground he flushed and went on in a more mundane tone i am glad you have the hope of mr langhopes arrival to keep you up modern science thank heaven can do such wonders in sustaining and prolonging life that even if there is little chance of recovery the faint spark may be nursed until he paused again conscious that the duskybrowed young woman slenderly erect in her dark blue linen and nurses cap was examining him with an intentness which contrasted curiously with the absentminded glance she had dropped on him in entering in such cases she said in a low tone there is practically no chance of recovery so i understand even if there were it would probably be deathinlife complete paralysis of the lower body he shuddered a dreadful fate she was so gay and active yes and the struggle with death for the next few weeks must involve incessant sufferingfrightful sufferingperhaps vainly i feared so he murmured his kind face paling then why do you thank heaven that modern science has found such wonderful ways of prolonging life he raised his head with a start and their eyes met he saw that the nurses face was pale and calm almost judicial in its composure and his selfpossession returned to him as a christian he answered with his slow smile i can hardly do otherwise justine continued to consider him thoughtfully the men of the older generation clergymen i mean she went on in a low controlled voice would of course take that view must take it but the conditions are so changed so many undreamedof means of prolonging life prolonging suffering have been discovered and applied in the last few years that i wonderedin my profession one often wonders i understand he rejoined sympathetically forgetting his youth and his inexperience in the simple desire to bring solace to a troubled mind i understand your feeling but you need have no doubt human life is sacred and the fact that even in this materialistic age science is continually struggling to preserve and prolong it shows very beautifully i think how all things work together to fulfill the divine will then you believe that the divine will delights in mere pain mere meaningless animal suffering for its own sake surely not but for the sake of the spiritual life that may be mysteriously wrung out of it justine bent her puzzled brows on him i could understand that view of moral suffering or even of physical pain moderate enough to leave the mind clear and to call forth qualities of endurance and renunciation but where the body has been crushed to a pulp and the mind is no more than a machine for the registering of senseimpressions of physical anguish of what use can such suffering be to its owner or to the divine will the young rector looked at her sadly almost severely there miss brent we touch on inscrutable things and human reason must leave the answer to faith justine pondered so that one may say christianity recognizes no exceptions none none its authorized exponent pronounced emphatically then christianity and science are agreed she rose and the young rector with visible reluctance stood up also that again is one of the most striking evidences he began and then as the necessity of taking leave was forced upon him he added appealingly i understand your uncertainties your questionings and i wish i could have made my point clearer thank you it is quite clear the reasons of course are different but the result is exactly the same she held out her hand smiling sadly on him and with a sudden return of youth and selfconsciousness he murmured shyly i feel for you the man in him yearning over her loneliness though the pastor dared not press his help xxviii that evening when justine took her place at the bedside and the other two nurses had gone down to supper bessy turned her head slightly resting her eyes on her friend the roseshaded lamp cast a tint of life on her face and the dark circles of pain made her eyes look deeper and brighter justine was almost deceived by the delusive semblance of vitality and a hope that was half anguish stirred in her she sat down by the bed clasping the hand on the sheet you feel better tonight i breathebetter the words came brokenly between long pauses but without the hard agonized gasps of the previous night thats a good sign justine paused and then letting her fingers glide once or twice over the back of bessys hand you know dear mr amherst is coming she leaned down to say bessys eyes moved again slowly inscrutably she had never asked for her husband soon she whispered he had started on a long journey to outoftheway places to study something about cotton growing my message has just overtaken him justine explained bessy lay still her breast straining for breath she remained so long without speaking that justine began to think she was falling back into the somnolent state that intervened between her moments of complete consciousness but at length she lifted her lids again and her lips stirred he will belongcoming some days howmany we cant tell yet silence again bessys features seemed to shrink into a kind of waxen quietude as though her face were seen under clear water a long way down and then as she lay thus without sound or movement two tears forced themselves through her lashes and rolled down her cheeks justine bending close wiped them away bessy the wet lashes were raised an anguished look met her gaze i i cant bear it what dear the pain shant i diebefore you may get well bessy justine felt her hand quiver walk again perhapsnot that this i cant bear it her head drooped sideways turning away toward the wall justine that night kept her vigil with an aching heart the news of amhersts return had produced no sign of happiness in his wife the tears had been forced from her merely by the dread of being kept alive during the long days of pain before he came the medical explanation might have been that repeated crises of intense physical anguish and the deep lassitude succeeding them had so overlaid all other feelings or at least so benumbed their expression that it was impossible to conjecture how bessys little halfsmothered spark of soul had really been affected by the news but justine did not believe in this argument her experience among the sick had convinced her on the contrary that the shafts of grief or joy will find a crack in the heaviest armour of physical pain that the tiniest gleam of hope will light up depths of mental inanition and somehow send a ray to the surface it was true that bessy had never known how to bear pain and that her own sensations had always formed the centre of her universe yet for that very reason if the thought of seeing amherst had made her happier it would have lifted at least momentarily the weight of death from her body justine at first had almost feared the contrary effect feared that the moral depression might show itself in a lowering of physical resistance but the body kept up its obstinate struggle against death drawing strength from sources of vitality unsuspected in that frail envelope the surgeons report the next day was more favourable and every day won from death pointed now to a faint chance of recovery such at least was wyants view dr garford and the consulting surgeons had not yet declared themselves but the young doctor strung to the highest point of watchfulness and constantly in attendance on the patient was tending toward a hopeful prognosis the growing conviction spurred him to fresh efforts at dr garfords request he had temporarily handed over his clifton practice to a young new york doctor in need of change and having installed himself at lynbrook he gave up his days and nights to mrs amhersts case if any one can save her wyant will dr garford had declared to justine when on the tenth day after the accident the surgeons held their third consultation dr garford reserved his own judgment he had seen cases they had all seen casesbut just at present the signs might point either way meanwhile wyants confidence was an invaluable asset toward the patients chances of recovery hopefulness in the physician was almost as necessary as in the patient contact with such faith had been known to work miracles justine listened in silence wishing that she too could hope but whichever way the prognosis pointed she felt only a dull despair she believed no more than dr garford in the chance of recovery that conviction seemed to her a mirage of wyants imagination of his boyish ambition to achieve the impossible and every hopeful symptom pointed in her mind only to a longer period of useless suffering her hours at bessys side deepened her revolt against the energy spent in the fight with death since bessy had learned that her husband was returning she had never by sign or word reverted to the fact except for a gleam of tenderness now and then when cicely was brought to her she seemed to have sunk back into herself as though her poor little flicker of consciousness were wholly centred in the contemplation of its pain it was not that her mind was clouded only that it was immersed absorbed in that dread mystery of disproportionate anguish which a capricious fate had laid on it and what if she recovered as they called it if the floodtide of pain should ebb leaving her stranded a helpless wreck on the desert shores of inactivity what would life be to bessy without movement thought would never set her blood flowing motion in her could only take the form of the physical processes her love for amherst was dead even if it flickered into life again it could but put the spark to smouldering discords and resentments and would her one uncontaminated sentiment her affection for cicely suffice to reconcile her to the desolate halflife which was the utmost that science could hold out here again justines experience answered no she did not believe in bessys powers of moral recuperation her body seemed less near death than her spirit life had been poured out to her in generous measure and she had spilled the precious draught the few drops remaining in the cup could no longer renew her strength pity not condemnation profound illimitable pity flowed from this conclusion of justines to a compassionate heart there could be no sadder instance of the wastefulness of life than this struggle of the small halfformed soul with a destiny too heavy for its strength if bessy had had any moral hope to fight for every pang of suffering would have been worth enduring but it was intolerable to witness the spectacle of her useless pain incessant commerce with such thoughts made justine as the days passed crave any escape from solitude any contact with other ideas even the reappearance of westy gaines bringing a breath of commonplace conventional grief into the haunted silence of the house was a respite from her questionings if it was hard to talk to him to answer his enquiries to assent to his platitudes it was harder a thousand times to go on talking to herself mr tredegars coming was a distinct relief his dryness was like cautery to her wound mr tredegar undoubtedly grieved for bessy but his grief struck inward exuding only now and then through the fissures of his hard manner in a touch of extra solemnity the more laboured rounding of a period yet on the whole it was to his feeling that justine felt her own to be most akin if his stoic acceptance of the inevitable proceeded from the resolve to spare himself pain that at least was a form of strength an indication of character she had never cared for the fluencies of invertebrate sentiment now on the evening of the day after her talk with bessy it was more than ever a solace to escape from the torment of her thoughts into the rarefied air of mr tredegars presence the day had been a bad one for the patient and justines distress had been increased by the receipt of a cable from mr langhope announcing that owing to delay in reaching brindisi he had missed the fast steamer from cherbourg and would not arrive till four or five days later than he had expected mr tredegar in response to her report had announced his intention of coming down by a late train and now he and justine and dr wyant after dining together were seated before the fire in the smokingroom i take it then mr tredegar said turning to wyant that the chances of her living to see her father are very slight the young doctor raised his head eagerly not in my opinion sir unless unforeseen complications arise i can almost promise to keep her alive for another month im not afraid to call it six weeks hm garford doesnt say so no dr garford argues from precedent and you mr tredegars thin lips were visited by the ghost of a smile oh i dont argue i just feel my way said wyant imperturbably and yet you dont hesitate to predict no i dont sir because the case as i see it presents certain definite indications he began to enumerate them cleverly avoiding the use of technicalities and trying to make his point clear by the use of simple illustration and analogy it sickened justine to listen to his passionate exposition she had heard it so often she believed in it so little mr tredegar turned a probing glance on him as he ended then today even you believe not only in the possibility of prolonging life but of ultimate recovery wyant hesitated i wont call it recovery today say life indefinitely prolonged and the paralysis it might disappear after a few months or a few years such an outcome would be unusual exceptional but then there are exceptions and im straining every nerve to make this one and the suffering such as todays for instance is unavoidable unhappily and bound to increase well as the anр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв

with mr tredegar he turned to her thoughtfully that young fellow seems sure of himself you believe in him justine hesitated not in his expectation of recovery no one does but you think they can keep the poor child alive till langhope and her husband get back there was a moments pause then justine murmured it can be donei think yes its horrible said mr tredegar suddenly as if in answer to her thought she looked up in surprise and saw his eye resting on her with what seemed like a mist of sympathy on its vitreous surface her lips trembled parting as if for speech but she looked away without answering these new devices for keeping people alive mr tredegar continued they increase the suffering besides prolonging it yes in some cases in this case i am afraid so the lawyer drew out his fine cambric handkerchief and furtively wiped a slight dampness from his forehead i wish to god she had been killed he said justine lifted her head again with an answering exclamation oh yes its infernal the time they can make it last its useless justine broke out useless he turned his critical glance on her well thats beside the point since its inevitable she wavered a moment but his words had loosened the bonds about her heart and she could not check herself so suddenly why inevitable mr tredegar looked at her in surprise as though wondering at so unprofessional an utterance from one who under ordinary circumstances showed the absolute selfcontrol and submission of the welldisciplined nurse human life is sacred he said sententiously ah that must have been decreed by some one who had never suffered justine exclaimed mr tredegar smiled compassionately he evidently knew how to make allowances for the fact that she was overwrought by the sight of her friends suffering society decreed it not one person he corrected society science religion she murmured as if to herself precisely its the universal consensus the result of the worlds accumulated experience cruel in individual instances necessary for the general welfare of course your training has taught you all this but i can understand that at such a time yes she said rising wearily as wyant came in her worst misery now was to have to discuss bessys condition with wyant to the young physician bessy was no longer a suffering agonizing creature she was a case a beautiful case as the problem developed new intricacies becoming more and more of a challenge to his faculties of observation and inference justine saw the abstract scientific passion supersede his personal feeling of pity though his professional skill made him exquisitely tender to the patient under his hands he seemed hardly conscious that she was a woman who had befriended him and whom he had so lately seen in the brightness of health and enjoyment this view was normal enough it was as justine knew the ideal state of mind for the successful physician in whom sympathy for the patient as an individual must often impede swift choice and unfaltering action but what she shrank from was his resolve to save bessys life a resolve fortified to the point of exasperation by the scepticism of the consulting surgeons who saw in it only the youngsters natural desire to distinguish himself by performing a feat which his elders deemed impossible as the days dragged on and bessys sufferings increased justine longed for a protesting word from dr garford or one of his colleagues in her hospital experience she had encountered cases where the useless agonies of death were mercifully shortened by the physician why was not this a case for such treatment the answer was simple enough in the first place it was the duty of the surgeons to keep their patient alive till her husband and her father could reach her and secondly there was that faint illusive hope of socalled recovery in which none of them believed yet which they could not ignore in their treatment the evening after mr tredegars departure wyant was setting this forth at great length to justine bessy had had a bad morning the bronchial symptoms which had developed a day or two before had greatly increased her distress and there had been at dawn a moment of weakness when it seemed that some pitiful power was about to defeat the relentless efforts of science but wyant had fought off the peril by the prompt and audacious use of stimulants by a rapid marshalling of resources a display of selfreliance and authority which justine could not but admire as she mechanically seconded his efforts the spark of life had been revived and bessy won back for fresh suffering yes i say it can be done tonight i say it more than ever wyant exclaimed pushing the disordered hair from his forehead and leaning toward justine across the table on which their brief evening meal had been served i say the way the heart has rallied proves that weve got more strength to draw on than any of them have been willing to admit the breathings better too if we can fight off the degenerative processes and by george i believe we can he looked up suddenly at justine with you to work with i believe i could do anything how you do back a man up you think with your hands with every individual finger justine turned her eyes away she felt a shudder of repulsion steal over her tired body it was not that she detected any note of personal admiration in his praise he had commended her as the surgeon might commend a fine instrument fashioned for his use but that she should be the instrument to serve such a purpose that her skill her promptness her gift of divining and interpreting the will she worked with should be at the service of this implacable scientific passion ah no she could be silent no longer she looked up at wyant and their eyes met why do you do it she asked he stared as if thinking that she referred to some special point in his treatment do what its so uselessyou all know she must die i know nothing of the kindand even the others are not so sure today he began to go over it all again repeating his arguments developing new theories trying to force into her reluctant mind his own faith in the possibility of success justine sat resting her chin on her clasped hands her eyes gazing straight before her under dark tormented brows when he paused she remained silent well dont you believe me he broke out with sudden asperity i dont knowi cant tell but as long as theres a doubt even a doubt my way and ill show you there is if youll give me time how much time she murmured without shifting her gaze ah that depends on ourselves on you and me chiefly thats what garford admits they cant do much now theyve got to leave the game to us its a question of incessant vigilanceof utilizing every hour every moment times all i ask and you can give it to me if any one can under the challenge of his tone justine rose to her feet with a low murmur of fear ah dont ask me dont ask you i cant i cant wyant stood up also turning on her an astonished glance you cant what their eyes met and she thought she read in his a sudden divination of her inmost thoughts the discovery electrified her flagging strength restoring her to immediate clearness of brain she saw the gulf of selfbetrayal over which she had hung and the nearness of the peril nerved her to a last effort of dissimulation i canttalk of itany longer she faltered letting her tears flow and turning on him a face of pure womanly weakness wyant looked at her without answering did he distrust even these plain physical evidences of exhaustion or was he merely disappointed in her as in one whom he had believed to be above the emotional failings of her sex youre overtired he said coldly take tonight to rest miss mace can replace you for the next few hours and i may need you more tomorrow xxix four more days had passed bessy seldom spoke when justine was with her she was wrapped in a thickening cloud of opiates morphia by day bromides sulphonal chloral hydrate at night when the cloud broke and consciousness emerged it was centred in the one acute point of bodily anguish darting throes of neuralgia agonized oppression of the breath the diffused misery of the whole helpless body these were reducing their victim to a mere instrument on which pain played its incessant deadly variations once or twice she turned her dull eyes on justine breathing out i want to die as some inevitable lifting or readjusting thrilled her body with fresh pangs but there were no signs of contact with the outer world she had ceased even to ask for cicely and yet according to the doctors the patient held her own certain alarming symptoms had diminished and while others persisted the strength to fight them persisted too with such strength to call on what fresh agonies were reserved for the poor body when the narcotics had lost their power that was the question always before justine she never again betrayed her fears to wyant she carried out his orders with morbid precision trembling lest any failure in efficiency should revive his suspicions she hardly knew what she feared his suspecting she only had a confused sense that they were enemies and that she was the weaker of the two and then the anр в

almost exhausted it was not sure even now that bessy was going to die and she was certainly going to suffer a long time wyant seemed hardly conscious of the increase of pain his whole mind was fixed on the prognosis what matter if the patient suffered as long as he proved his case that of course was not his way of putting it in reality he did all he could to allay the pain surpassed himself in new devices and experiments but death confronted him implacably claiming his due so many hours robbed from him so much tribute to pay and wyant setting his teeth fought on and bessy paid justine had begun to notice that it was hard for her to get a word alone with dr garford the other nurses were not in the way it was wyant who always contrived to be there perhaps she was unreasonable in seeing a special intention in his presence it was natural enough that the two persons in charge of the case should confer together with their chief but his persistence annoyed her and she was glad when one afternoon the surgeon asked him to telephone an important message to town as soon as the door had closed justine said to dr garford she is beginning to suffer terribly he answered with the large impersonal gesture of the man to whom physical suffering has become a painful general fact of life no longer divisible into individual cases we are doing all we can yes she paused and then raised her eyes to his dry kind face is there any hope another gesture the fatalistic sweep of the lifted palms the next ten days will tell the fight is on as wyant says and if any one can do it that young fellow can theres stuff in him and infernal ambition yes but do you believe she can live dr garford smiled indulgently on such unprofessional insistence but she was past wondering what they must all think of her my dear miss brent he said i have reached the age when one always leaves a door open to the unexpected as he spoke a slight sound at her back made her turn wyant was behind her he must have entered as she put her question and he certainly could not have had time to descend the stairs walk the length of the house ring up new york and deliver dr garfords message the same thought seemed to strike the surgeon hello wyant he said line busy said wyant curtly about this time justine gave up her night vigils she could no longer face the struggle of the dawn hour when life ebbs lowest and since her duties extended beyond the sickroom she could fairly plead that she was more needed about the house by day but wyant protested he wanted her most at the difficult hour you know youre taking a chance from her he said almost sternly oh no he looked at her searchingly you dont feel up to it no he turned away with a slight shrug but she knew he resented her defection the day watches were miserable enough it was the nineteenth day now and justine lay on the sofa in amhersts sittingroom trying to nerve herself for the nurses summons a page torn out of the calendar lay before her she had been calculating again how many days must elapse before mr langhope could arrive ten days ten days and ten nights and the length of the nights was double as for amherst it was impossible to set a date for his coming for his steamer from buenos ayres called at various ports on the way northward and the length of her stay at each was dependent on the delivery of freight and on the dilatoriness of the south american official she threw down the calendar and leaned back pressing her hands to her temples oh for a word with amherst he alone would have understood what she was undergoing mr langhopes coming would make no difference or rather it would only increase the difficulty of the situation instinctively justine felt that though his heart would be wrung by the sight of bessys pain his cry would be the familiar one the traditional one keep her alive under his surface originality his verbal audacities and ironies mr langhope was the creature of accepted forms inherited opinions he had never really thought for himself on any of the pressing problems of life but amherst was different close contact with many forms of wretchedness had freed him from the bondage of accepted opinion he looked at life through no eyes but his own and what he saw he confessed to seeing he never tried to evade the consequences of his discoveries justines remembrance flew back to their first meeting at hanaford when his confidence in his own powers was still unshaken his trust in others unimpaired and gradually she began to relive each detail of their talk at dillons bedside her first impression of him as he walked down the ward the first sound of his voice her surprised sense of his authority her almost involuntary submission to his will then her thoughts passed on to their walk home from the hospital she recalled his sober yet unsparing summary of the situation at westmore and the note of insight with which he touched on the hardships of the workers then word by word their talk about dillon came backamhersts indignation and pityhis shudder of revolt at the mans doom in your work dont you ever feel tempted to set a poor devil free and then after her conventional murmur of protest to save what when all the good of life is gone to distract her thoughts she stretched her hand toward the bookcase taking out the first volume in reach the little copy of bacon she leaned back fluttering its pages aimlessly so wrapped in her own misery that the meaning of the words could not reach her it was useless to try to read every perception of the outer world was lost in the hum of inner activity that made her mind like a forge throbbing with heat and noise but suddenly her glance fell on some pencilled sentences on the flyleaf they were in amhersts hand and the sight arrested her as though she had heard him speak la vraie morale se moque de la morale we perish because we follow other mens examples socrates used to call the opinions of the many by the

day things were looking well as he would have phrased it and each day now was a fresh victory justine went through her task mechanically the glow of strength and courage remained steeling her to bear what had broken down miss maces professional fortitude but when she sat down by the bed bessys moaning began to wear on her it was no longer the utterance of human pain but the monotonous whimper of an animal the kind of sound that a compassionate hand would instinctively crush into silence but her hand had other duties she must keep watch on pulse and heart must reinforce their action with the tremendous stimulants which wyant was now using and having revived fresh sensibility to pain must presently try to allay it by the cautious use of narcotics it was all simple enough but suppose she should not do it suppose she left the stimulants untouched wyant was absent one nurse exhausted with fatigue the other laid low by headache justine had the field to herself for three hours at least no one was likely to cross the threshold of the sickroom ah if no more time were needed but there was too much life in bessy her youth was fighting too hard for her she would not sink out of life in three hoursand justine could not count on more than that she looked at the little travellingclock on the dressingtable and saw that its hands marked four an hour had passed already she rose and administered the prescribed restorative then she took the pulse and listened to the beat of the heart strong still too strong as she lifted her head the vague animal wailing ceased and she heard her name justine she bent down eagerly yes no answer the wailing had begun again but the one word showed her that the mind still lived in its torturehouse that the poor powerless body before her was not yet a mere bundle of senseless reflexes but her friend bessy amherst dying and feeling herself die justine reseated herself and the vigil began again the second hour ebbed slowly ah no it was flying now her eyes were on the hands of the clock and they seemed leagued against her to devour the precious minutes and now she could see by certain spasmodic symptoms that another crisis of pain was approaching one of the struggles that wyant at times had almost seemed to court and exult in bessys eyes turned on her again justine she knew what that meant it was an appeal for the hypodermic needle the little instrument lay at hand beside a newlyfilled bottle of morphia but she must wait must let the pain grow more severe yet she could not turn her gaze from bessy and bessys eyes entreated her again justine there was really no word now the whimperings were uninterrupted but justine heard an inner voice and its pleading shook her heart she rose and filled the syringe and returning with it bent above the bed she lifted her head and looked at the clock the second hour had passed as she looked she heard a step in the sittingroom who could it be not dr garfords assistant he was not due till seven she listened again one of the nurses no not a womans step the door opened and wyant came in justine stood by the bed without moving toward him he paused also as if surprised to see her there motionless in the intense silence she fancied for a moment that she heard bessys violent agonized breathing she tried to speak to drown the sound of the breathing but her lips trembled too much and she remained silent wyant seemed to hear nothing he stood so still that she felt she must move forward as she did so she picked up from the table by the bed the memoranda that it was her duty to submit to him well he said in the familiar sickroom whisper she is dead he fell back a step glaring at her white and incredulous dead when a few minutes ago dead its not possible he swept past her shouldering her aside pushing in an electric button as he sprang to the bed she perceived then that the room had been almost in darkness she recovered command of herself and followed him he was going through the usual rapid examination pulse heart breath hanging over the bed like some angry animal balked of its prey then he lifted the lids and bent close above the eyes take the shade off that lamp he commanded justine obeyed him he stooped down again to examine the eyeshe remained stooping a long time suddenly he stood up and faced her had she been in great pain yes worse than usual yes what had you done nothing there was no time no time he broke off to sweep the room again with his excited incredulous glance where are the others why were you here alone he demanded it came suddenly i was going to call their eyes met for a moment her face was perfectly calm she could feel that her lips no longer trembled she was not in the least afraid of wyants scrutiny as he continued to look at her his expression slowly passed from incredulous wrath to something softer more human she could not tell what this has been too much for you go and send one of the others its all over he said book iv xxx on a september day somewhat more than a year and a half after bessy amhersts death her husband and his mother sat at luncheon in the diningroom of the westmore house at hanaford the house was john amhersts now and shortly after the loss of his wife he had established himself there with his mother by a will made some six months before her death bessy had divided her estate between her husband and daughter placing cicelys share in trust and appointing mr langhope and amherst as her guardians as the latter was also her trustee the whole management of the estate devolved on him while his control of the westmore mills was ensured by his receiving a slightly larger proportion of the stock than his stepdaughter the will had come as a surprise not only to amherst himself but to his wifes family and more especially to her legal adviser mr tredegar had in fact had nothing to do with the drawing of the instrument but as it had been drawn in due form and by a firm of excellent standing he was obliged in spite of his private views and mr langhopes open adjurations that he should do something to declare that there was no pretext for questioning the validity of the document to amherst the will was something more than a proof of his wifes confidence it came as a reconciling word from her grave for the date showed that it had been made at a moment when he supposed himself to have lost all influence over her on the morrow of the day when she had stipulated that he should give up the management of the westmore mills and yield the care of her property to mr tredegar while she smote him with one hand she sued for pardon with the other and the contradiction was so characteristic it explained and excused in so touching a way the inconsistencies of her impulsive heart and hesitating mind that he was filled with that tender compunction that searching sense of his own shortcomings which generous natures feel when they find they have underrated the generosity of others but amhersts was not an introspective mind and his sound moral sense told him when the first pang of selfreproach had subsided that he had done his best by his wife and was in no way to blame if her recognition of the fact had come too late the selfreproach subsided and instead of the bitterness of the past it left a softened memory which made him take up his task with the sense that he was now working with bessy and not against her yet perhaps after all it was chiefly the work itself which had healed old wounds and quelled the tendency to vain regrets amherst was only thirtyfour and in the prime of his energies the task he was made for had been given back to him to a sound nature which finds its outlet in fruitful action nothing so simplifies the complexities of life so tends to a large acceptance of its vicissitudes and mysteries as the sense of doing something each day toward clearing ones own bit of the wilderness and this was the joy at last conceded to amherst the mills were virtually his and the fact that he ruled them not only in his own right but as cicelys representative made him doubly eager to justify his wifes trust in him mrs amherst looking up from a telegram which the parlourmaid had handed her smiled across the table at her son from maria ansell they are all coming tomorrow ah thats good amherst rejoined i should have been sorry if cicely had not been here mr langhope is coming too his mother continued im glad of that john yes amherst again assented the morrow was to be a great day at westmore the emergency hospital planned in the first months of his marriage and abandoned in the general reduction of expenditure at the mills had now been completed on a larger and more elaborate scale as a memorial to bessy the strict retrenchment of all personal expenses and the leasing of lynbrook and the town house had enabled amherst in eighteen months to lay by enough income to carry out this plan which he was impatient to see executed as a visible commemoration of his wifes generosity to westmore for amherst persisted in regarding the gift of her fortune as a gift not to himself but to the mills he looked on himself merely as the agent of her beneficent intentions he was anxious that westmore and hanaford should take the same view and the opening of the westmore memorial hospital was therefore to be performed with an unwonted degree of ceremony i am glad mr langhope is coming mrs amherst repeated as they rose from the table it shows dear doesnt it that hes really gratified that he appreciates your motive she raised a proud glance to her tall son whose head seemed to tower higher than ever above her small proportions renewed selfconfidence and the habit of command had in fact restored the erectness to amhersts shoulders and the clearness to his eyes the cleft between the brows was gone and his veiled inward gaze had given place to a glance almost as outwardlooking and unspeculative as his mothers it shows well yes what you say he rejoined with a slight laugh and a tap on her shoulder as she passed he was under no illusions as to his fatherinlaws attitude he knew that mr langhope would willingly have broken the will which deprived his granddaughter of half her inheritance and that his subsequent show of friendliness was merely a concession to expediency but in his present mood amherst almost believed that time and closer relations might turn such sentiments into honest liking he was very fond of his little stepdaughter and deeply sensible of his obligations toward her and he hoped that as mr langhope came to recognize this it might bring about a better understanding between them his mother detained him youre going back to the mills at once i wanted to consult you about the rooms miss brent had better be next to cicely i suppose so yes ill see you before i go he nodded affectionately and passed on his hands full of papers into the oriental smokingroom now dedicated to the unexpected uses of an office and study mrs amherst as she turned away found the parlourmaid in the act of opening the front door to the highlytinted and welldressed figure of mrs harry dressel im so delighted to hear that youre expecting justine began mrs dressel as the two ladies passed into the drawingroom ah youve heard too mrs amherst rejoined enthroning her visitor in one of the monumental plush armchairs beneath the threatening weight of the bay of naples i hadnt till this moment in fact i flew in to ask for news and on the doorstep there was such a strikinglooking young man enquiring for her and i heard the parlourmaid say she was arriving tomorrow a young man some one you didnt know striking apparitions of the male sex were of infrequent occurrence at hanaford and mrs amhersts unabated interest in the movement of life caused her to dwell on this statement oh no im sure he was a stranger extremely slight and pale with remarkable eyes he was so disappointed he seemed sure of finding her well no doubt hell come back tomorrow you know were expecting the whole party added mrs amherst to whom the imparting of good news was always an irresistible temptation mrs dressels interest deepened at once really mr langhope too yes its a great pleasure to my son it must be im so glad i suppose in a way it will be rather sad for mr langhope seeing everything here so unchanged mrs amherst straightened herself a little i think he will prefer to find it so she said with a barely perceptible change of tone oh i dont know they were never very fond of this house there was an added note of authority in mrs dressels accent in the last few months she had been to europe and had had nervous prostration and these incontestable evidences of growing prosperity could not always be kept out of her voice and bearing at any rate they justified her in thinking that her opinion on almost any subject within the range of human experience was a valuable addition to the sumtotal of wisdom and unabashed by the silence with which her comment was received she continued her critical survey of the drawingroom dear mrs amherst you know i cant help saying what i think and ive so often wondered why you dont do this room over with these high ceilings you could do something lovely in louis seize a faint pink rose to mrs amhersts cheeks i dont think my son would ever care to make any changes here she said oh i understand his feeling but when he begins to entertain and you know poor bessy always hated this furniture mrs amherst smiled slightly perhaps if he marries again she said seizing at random on a pretext for changing the subject mrs dressel dropped the hands with which she was absentmindedly assuring herself of the continuance of unbroken relations between her hat and her hair marries again why you dont mean he doesnt think of it not in the least i spoke figuratively her hostess rejoined with a laugh oh of course i see he really couldnt marry could he i mean it would be so wrong to cicely under the circumstances mrs amhersts black eyebrows gathered in a slight frown she had already noticed on the part of the hanaford clan a disposition to regard amherst as imprisoned in the conditions of his trust and committed to the obligation of handing on unimpaired to cicely the fortune his wifes caprice had bestowed on him and this open expression of the family view was singularly displeasing to her i had not thought of it in that light but its really of no consequence how one looks at a thing that is not going to happen she said carelessly no naturally i see you were only joking hes so devoted to cicely isnt he mrs dressel rejoined with her bright obtuseness a step on the threshold announced amhersts approach im afraid i must be off mother he began halting in the doorway with the instinctive masculine recoil from the afternoon caller oh mr amherst how dyou do i suppose youre very busy about tomorrow i just flew in to find out if justine was really coming mrs dressel explained a little fluttered by the effort of recalling what she had been saying when he entered i believe my mother expects the whole party amherst replied shaking hands with the false bonhomie of the man entrapped how delightful and its so nice to think that mr langhopes arrangement with justine still works so well mrs dressel hastened on nervously hoping that her volubility would smother any recollection of what he had chanced to overhear mr langhope is lucky in having persuaded miss brent to take charge of cicely mrs amherst quietly interposed yes and it was so lucky for justine too when she came back from europe with us last autumn i could see she simply hated the idea of taking up her nursing again amhersts face darkened at the allusion and his mother said hurriedly ah she was tired poor child but im only afraid that after the summers rest she may want some more active occupation than looking after a little girl oh i think not shes so fond of cicely and of course its everything to her to have a comfortable home mrs amherst smiled at her age its not always everything mrs dressel stared slightly oh justines twentyseven you know shes not likely to marry now she said with the mild finality of the earlywedded she rose as she spoke extending cordial hands of farewell you must be so busy preparing for the great dayif only it doesnt rain no please mr amherst its a mere step im walking that afternoon as amherst walked out toward westmore for a survey of the final preparations he found that among the pleasant thoughts accompanying him one of the pleasantest was the anticipation of seeing justine brent among the little group who were to surround him on the morrow she was the only one discerning enough to understand what the day meant to him or with sufficient knowledge to judge of the use he had made of his great opportunity even now that the opportunity had come and all obstacles were levelled sympathy with his work was as much lacking as ever and only duplain at length reinstated as manager really understood and shared in his aims but justine brents sympathy was of a different kind from the managers if less logical it was warmer more penetrating like some fine imponderable fluid so subtle that it could always find a way through the clumsy processes of human intercourse amherst had thought very often of this quality in her during the weeks which followed his abrupt departure for georgia and in trying to define it he had said to himself that she felt with her brain and now aside from the instinctive understanding between them she was set apart in his thoughts by her association with his wifes last days on his arrival from the south he had gathered on all sides evidences of her tender devotion to bessy even mr tredegars chary praise swelled the general commendation from the surgeons he heard how her unwearied skill had helped them in their fruitless efforts poor cicely awed by her loss clung to her mothers friend with childish tenacity and the young rector of saint annes shyly acquitting himself of his visit of condolence dwelt chiefly on the consolatory thought of miss brents presence at the deathbed the knowledge that justine had been with his wife till the end had in fact done more than anything else to soften amhersts regrets and he had tried to express something of this in the course of his first talk with her justine had given him a clear and selfpossessed report of the dreadful weeks at lynbrook but at his first allusion to her own part in them she shrank into a state of distress which seemed to plead with him to refrain from even the tenderest touch on her feelings it was a peculiarity of their friendship that silence and absence had always mysteriously fostered its growth and he now felt that her reticence deepened the understanding between them as the freest confidences might not have done soon afterward an opportune attack of nervous prostration had sent mrs harry dressel abroad and justine was selected as her companion they remained in europe for six months and on their return amherst learned with pleasure that mr langhope had asked miss brent to take charge of cicely mr langhopes sorrow for his daughter had been aggravated by futile wrath at her unaccountable will and the mixed sentiment thus engendered had found expression in a jealous outpouring of affection toward cicely he took immediate possession of the child and in the first stages of his affliction her companionship had been really consoling but as time passed and the pleasant habits of years reasserted themselves her presence became in small unacknowledged ways a source of domestic irritation nursery hours disturbed the easy routine of his household the elderly parlourmaid who had long ruled it resented the intervention of cicelys nurse the little governess involved in the dispute broke down and had to be shipped home to germany a successor was hard to find and in the interval mr langhopes privacy was invaded by a stream of visiting teachers who were always wanting to consult him about cicelys lessons and lay before him their tiresome complaints and perplexities poor mr langhope found himself in the position of the mourner who in the first fervour of bereavement has undertaken the construction of an imposing monument without having counted the cost he had meant that his devotion to cicely should be a monument to his paternal grief but the foundations were scarcely laid when he found that the funds of time and patience were almost exhausted pride forbade his consigning cicely to her stepfather though mrs amherst would gladly have undertaken her care mrs ansells migratory habits made it impossible for her to do more than intermittently hover and advise and a new hope rose before mr langhope when it occurred to him to appeal to miss brent the experiment had proved a success and when amherst met justine again she had been for some months in charge of the little girl and change and congenial occupation had restored her to a normal view of life there was no trace in her now of the dumb misery which had haunted him at their parting she was again the vivid creature who seemed more charged with life than any one he had ever known the crisis through which she had passed showed itself only in a smoothing of the brow and deepening of the eyes as though a bloom of experience had veiled without deadening the first brilliancy of youth as he lingered on the image thus evoked he recalled mrs dressels words justine is twentyseven shes not likely to marry now oddly enough he had never thought of her marrying but now that he heard the possibility questioned he felt a disagreeable conviction of its inevitableness mrs dressels view was of course absurd in spite of justines feminine graces he had formerly felt in her a kind of elfin immaturity as of a flitting ariel with untouched heart and senses it was only of late that she had developed the subtle quality which calls up thoughts of love not marry why the vagrant fire had just lighted on her and the fact that she was poor and unattached with her own way to make and no setting of pleasure and elegance to embellish her these disadvantages seemed as nothing to amherst against the warmth of personality in which she moved and besides she would never be drawn to the kind of man who needed fine clothes and luxury to point him to the charm of sex she was always finished and graceful in appearance with the pretty womans art of wearing her few plain dresses as if they were many and varied yet no one could think of her as attaching much importance to the upholstery of life no the man who won her would be of a different type have other inducements to offerand amherst found himself wondering just what those inducements would be suddenly he remembered something his mother had said as he left the house something about a distinguishedlooking young man who had called to ask for miss brent mrs amherst innocently inquisitive in small matters had followed her son into the hall to ask the parlourmaid if the gentleman had left his name and the parlourmaid had answered in the negative the young man was evidently not indigenous all the social units of hanaford were intimately known to each other he was a stranger therefore presumably drawn there by the hope of seeing miss brent but if he knew that she was coming he must be intimately acquainted with her movements the thought came to amherst as an unpleasant surprise it showed him for the first time how little he knew of justines personal life of the ties she might have formed outside the lynbrook circle after all he had seen her chiefly not among her own friends but among his wifes was it reasonable to suppose that a creature of her keen individuality would be content to subsist on the fringe of other existences somewhere of course she must have a centre of her own must be subject to influences of which he was wholly ignorant and since her departure from lynbrook he had known even less of her life she had spent the previous winter with mr langhope in new york where amherst had seen her only on his rare visits to cicely and mr langhope on going abroad for the summer had established his granddaughter in a bar harbour cottage where save for two flying visits from mrs ansell miss brent had reigned alone till his return in september very likely amherst reflected the mysterious visitor was a bar harbour acquaintance no more than an acquaintance a friend and as mr langhopes party had left mount desert but three days previously the arrival of the unknown at hanaford showed a singular impatience to rejoin miss brent as he reached this point in his meditations amherst found himself at the streetcorner where it was his habit to pick up the westmore trolley just as it bore down on him and he sprang to the platform another car coming in from the mills stopped to discharge its passengers among them amherst noticed a slender undersized man in shabby clothes about whose retreating back as he crossed the street to signal a station avenue car there was something dimly familiar and suggestive of troubled memories amherst leaned out and looked again yes the back was certainly like dr wyants but what could wyant be doing at hanaford and in a westmore car amhersts first impulse was to spring out and overtake him he knew how admirably the young physician had borne himself at lynbrook he even recalled dr garfords saying with his kindly sceptical smile poor wyant believed to the end that we could save her and felt again his own inward movement of thankfulness that the cruel miracle had not been worked he owed a great deal to wyant and had tried to express his sense of the fact by warm words and a liberal fee but since bessys death he had never returned to lynbrook and had consequently lost sight of the young doctor now he felt that he ought to try to rejoin him to find out why he was at hanaford and make some proffer of hospitality but if the stranger were really wyant his choice of the station avenue car made it appear that he was on his way to catch the new york express and in any case amhersts engagements at westmore made immediate pursuit impossible he consoled himself with the thought that if the physician was not leaving hanaford he would be certain to call at the house and then his mind flew back to justine brent but the pleasure of looking forward to her arrival was disturbed by new feelings a sense of reserve and embarrassment had sprung up in his mind checking that free mental communion which as he now perceived had been one of the unconscious promoters of their friendship it was as though his thoughts faced a stranger instead of the familiar presence which had so long dwelt in them and he began to see that the feeling of intelligence existing between justine and himself was not the result of actual intimacy but merely of the charm she knew how to throw over casual intercourse when he had left his house his mind was like a summer sky all open blue and sunlit rolling clouds but gradually the clouds had darkened and massed themselves till they drew an impenetrable veil over the upper light and stretched threateningly across his whole horizon xxxi the celebrations at westmore were over hanaford society mustering for the event had streamed through the hospital inspected the clinic complimented amherst recalled itself to mr langhope and mrs ansell and streamed out again to regain its carriages and motors the chief actors in the ceremony were also taking leave mr langhope somewhat pale and nervous after the ordeal had been helped into the gaines landau with mrs ansell and cicely mrs amherst had accepted a seat in the dressel victoria and westy gaines with an empressement slightly tinged by condescension was in the act of placing his electric phaeton at miss brents disposal she stood in the pretty white porch of the hospital looking out across its squares of floweredged turf at the long street of westmore in the warm goldpowdered light of september the factory town still seemed a blot on the face of nature yet here and there on all sides justines eye saw signs of humanizing change the rough banks along the street had been levelled and sodded young maples set in rows already made a long festoon of gold against the dingy housefronts and the houses themselves once so irreclaimably outlawed and degraded showed in their whitecurtained windows their flowery whiterailed yards a growing approach to civilized human dwellings glancing the other way one still met the grim pile of factories cutting the sky with their harsh rooflines and blackened chimneys but here also were signs of improvement one of the mills had already been enlarged another was scaffolded for the same purpose and young trees and neatlyfenced turf replaced the surrounding desert of trampled earth as amherst came out of the hospital he heard miss brent declining a seat in westys phaeton thank you so much but theres some one here i want to see first one of the operatives and i can easily take a hanaford car she held out her hand with the smile that ran like colour over her whole face and westy nettled by this unaccountable disregard of her privileges mounted his chariot alone as he glided mournfully away amherst turned to justine you wanted to see the dillons he asked their eyes met and she smiled again he had never seen her so sunnedover so luminous since the distant november day when they had picnicked with cicely beside the swamp he wondered vaguely if she were more elaborately dressed than usual or if the festal impression she produced were simply a reflection of her mood i do want to see the dillons how did you guess she rejoined and amherst felt a sudden impulse to reply for the same reason that made you think of them the fact of her remembering the dillons made him absurdly happy it reestablished between them the mental communion that had been checked by his thoughts of the previous day i suppose im rather selfconscious about the dillons because theyre one of my object lessons they illustrate the text he said laughing as they went down the steps westmore had been given a halfholiday for the opening of the hospital and as amherst and justine turned into the street parties of workers were dispersing toward their houses they were still a dulleyed stunted throng to whom air and movement seemed to have been too long denied but there was more animation in the groups more light in individual faces many of the younger men returned amhersts goodday with a look of friendliness and the women to whom he spoke met him with a volubility that showed the habit of frequent intercourse how much you have done justine exclaimed as he rejoined her after one of these asides but the next moment he saw a shade of embarrassment cross her face as though she feared to have suggested comparisons she had meant to avoid he answered quite naturally yes im beginning to see my way now and its wonderful how they respond and they walked on without a shadow of constraint between them while he described to her what was already done and what direction his projected experiments were taking the dillons had been placed in charge of one of the old factory tenements now transformed into a lodginghouse for unmarried operatives even its harsh brick exterior hung with creepers and brightened by flowerborders had taken on a friendly air and indoors it had a clean sunny kitchen a big diningroom with cheerfulcoloured walls and a room where the men could lounge and smoke about a table covered with papers the creation of these model lodginghouses had always been a favourite scheme of amhersts and the dillons incapacitated for factory work had shown themselves admirably adapted to their new duties in mrs dillons small hot sittingroom among the starched sofatidies and pink shells that testified to the family prosperity justine shone with enjoyment and sympathy she had always taken an interest in the lives and thoughts of workingpeople not so much the constructive interest of the sociological mind as the vivid imaginative concern of a heart open to every human appeal she liked to hear about their hard struggles and small pathetic successes the childrens sicknesses the fathers lucky job the little sum they had been able to put by the plans they had formed for tommys advancement and how sues good marks at school were still ahead of mrs hagans marys what i really like is to gossip with them and give them advice about the babys cough and the cheapest way to do their marketing she said laughing as she and amherst emerged once more into the street its the same kind of interest i used to feel in my dolls and guinea pigs a managing interfering old maids interest i dont believe i should care a straw for them if i couldnt dose them and order them about amherst laughed too he recalled the time when he had dreamed that just such warm personal sympathy was her sexs destined contribution to the broad work of human beneficence well it had not been a dream here was a woman whose deeds spoke for her and suddenly the thought came to him what might they not do at westmore together the brightness of it was blinding like the dazzle of sunlight which faced them as they walked toward the mills but it left him speechless confused glad to have a pretext for routing duplain out of the office introducing him to miss brent and asking him for the keys of the buildings it was wonderful again how she grasped what he was doing in the mills and saw how his whole scheme hung together harmonizing the work and leisure of the operatives instead of treating them as half machine half man and neglecting the man for the machine nor was she content with utopian generalities she wanted to know the how and why of each case to hear what conclusions he drew from his results to what solutions his experiments pointed in explaining the mill work he forgot his constraint and returned to the free comradery of mind that had always marked their relation he turned the key reluctantly in the last door and paused a moment on the threshold anything more he said with a laugh meant to hide his desire to prolong their tour she glanced up at the sun which still swung free of the tall factory roofs as much as youve time for cicely doesnt need me this afternoon and i cant tell when i shall see westmore again her words fell on him with a chill his smile faded and he looked away for a moment but i hope cicely will be here often he said oh i hope so too she rejoined with seeming unconsciousness of any connection between the wish and her previous words amherst hesitated he had meant to propose a visit to the old eldorado building which now at last housed the longdesired nightschools and nursery but since she had spoken he felt a sudden indifference to showing her anything more what was the use if she meant to leave cicely and drift out of his reach he could get on well enough without sympathy and comprehension but his momentary indulgence in them made the ordinary taste of life a little flat there must be more to see she continued as they turned back toward the village and he answered absently oh yes if you like he heard the change in his own voice and knew by her quick sideglance that she had heard it too please let me see everything that is compatible with my getting a car to hanaford by six well then the nightschool next he said with an effort at lightness and to shake off the importunity of his own thoughts he added carelessly as they walked on by the way it seems improbable but i think i saw dr wyant yesterday in a westmore car she echoed the name in surprise dr wyant really are you sure not quite but if it wasnt he it was his ghost you havent heard of his being at hanaford no ive heard nothing of him for ages something in her tone made him return her sideglance but her voice on closer analysis denoted only indifference and her profile seemed to express the same negative sentiment he remembered a vague lynbrook rumour to the effect that the young doctor had been attracted to miss brent such floating seeds of gossip seldom rooted themselves in his mind but now the fact acquired a new significance and he wondered how he could have thought so little of it at the time probably her somewhat exaggerated air of indifference simply meant that she had been bored by wyants attentions and that the reminder of them still roused a slight selfconsciousness amherst was relieved by this conclusion and murmuring oh i suppose it cant have been he led her rapidly on to the eldorado but the old sense of free communion was again obstructed and her interest in the details of the schools and nursery now seemed to him only a part of her wonderful art of absorbing herself in other peoples affairs he was a fool to have been duped by it to have fancied it was anything more personal than a grace of manner as she turned away from inspecting the blackboards in one of the empty schoolrooms he paused before her and said suddenly you spoke of not seeing westmore again are you thinking of leaving cicely the words were almost the opposite of those he had intended to speak it was as if some irrepressible inner conviction flung defiance at his surface distrust of her she stood still also and he saw a thought move across her face not immediately but perhaps when mr langhope can make some other arrangement owing to the halfholiday they had the schoolbuilding to themselves and the fact of being alone with her without fear of interruption woke in amherst an uncontrollable longing to taste for once the joy of unguarded utterance why do you go he asked moving close to the platform on which she stood she hesitated resting her hand on the teachers desk her eyes were kind but he thought her tone was cold this easy life is rather out of my line she said at length with a smile that draped her words in vagueness amherst looked at her again she seemed to be growing remote and inaccessible you mean that you dont want to stay his tone was so abrupt that it called forth one of her rare blushes no not that i have been very happy with cicely but soon i shall have to be doing something else why was she blushing and what did her last phrase mean something else the blood hummed in his ears he began to hope she would not answer too quickly she had sunk into the seat behind the desk propping her elbows on its lid and letting her interlaced hands support her chin a little bunch of violets which had been thrust into the folds of her dress detached itself and fell to the floor what i mean is she said in a low voice raising her eyes to amhersts that ive had a great desire lately to get back to real work my special work ive been too idle for the last year i want to do some hard nursing i want to help people who are miserable she spoke earnestly almost passionately and as he listened his undefined fear was lifted he had never before seen her in this mood with brooding brows and the darkness of the worlds pain in her eyes all her glow had faded she was a dun thrushlike creature clothed in semitints yet she seemed much nearer than when her smile shot light on him he stood motionless his eyes absently fixed on the bunch of violets at her feet suddenly he raised his head and broke out with a boyish blush could it have been wyant who was trying to see you dr wyant trying to see me she lowered her hands to the desk and sat looking at him with open wonder he saw the irrelevance of his question and burst in spite of himself into youthful laughter i mean its only that an unknown visitor called at the house yesterday and insisted that you must have arrived he seemed so annoyed at not finding you that i thoughti imaginedit must be some one who knew you very welland who had followed you herefor some special reason her colour rose again as if caught from his but her eyes still declared her ignorance some special reason and just now he blurted out when you said you might not stay much longer with cicely i thought of the visit and wondered if there was some one you meant to marry a silence fell between them justine rose slowly her eyes screened under the veil she had lowered no i dont mean to marry she said halfsmiling as she came down from the platform restored to his level her small shadowy head just in a line with his eyes she seemed closer more approachable and feminine yet amherst did not dare to speak she took a few steps toward the window looking out into the deserted street its growing dark i must go home she said yes he assented absently as he followed her he had no idea what she was saying the inner voices in which they habitually spoke were growing louder than outward words or was it only the voice of his own desires that he heard the cry of new hopes and unguessed capacities of living all within him was floodtide this was the top of life surely to feel her alike in his brain and his pulses to steep sight and hearing in the joy of her nearness while all the while thought spoke clear this is the mate of my mind he began again abruptly wouldnt you marry if it gave you the chance to do what you say if it offered you hard work and the opportunity to make things betterfor a great many peopleas no one but yourself could do it it was a strange way of putting his case he was aware of it before he ended but it had not occurred to him to tell her that she was lovely and desirable in his humility he thought that what he had to give would plead for him better than what he was the effect produced on her by his question though undecipherable was extraordinary she stiffened a little remaining quite motionless her eyes on the street you she just breathed and he saw that she was beginning to tremble his wooing had been harsh and clumsy he was afraid it had offended her and his hand trembled too as it sought hers i only thought it would be a dull business to most women and im tied to it for lifebut i thoughtive seen so often how you pity sufferinghow you long to relieve it she turned away from him with a shuddering sigh oh i hate suffering she broke out raising her hands to her face amherst was frightened how senseless of him to go on reiterating the old plea he ought to have pleaded for himself to have let the man in him seek her and take his defeat instead of beating about the flimsy bush of philanthropy i only meant i was trying to make my work recommend me he said with a halflaugh as she remained silent her eyes still turned away the silence continued for a long time it stretched between them like a narrowing interminable road down which with a leaden heart he seemed to watch her gradually disappearing and then unexpectedly as she shrank to a tiny speck at the dip of the road the perspective was mysteriously reversed and he felt her growing nearer again felt her close to him felt her hand in his im really just like other women you know i shall like it because its your work she said xxxii every one agreed that on the whole mr langhope had behaved extremely well he was just beginning to regain his equanimity in the matter of the will to perceive that in the eyes of the public something important and distinguished was being done at westmore and that the venture while reducing cicelys income during her minority might in some incredible way actually make for its ultimate increase so much mr langhope always eager to take the easiest view of the inevitable had begun to let fall in his confidential comments on amherst when his newlyregained balance was rudely shaken by the news of his soninlaws marriage the free expression of his anger was baffled by the fact that even by the farthest stretch of selfextenuating logic he could find no one to blame for the event but himself why on earth dont you say so dont you call me a tripledyed fool for bringing them together he challenged mrs ansell as they had the matter out together in the small intimate drawingroom of her new york apartment mrs ansell stirring her tea with a pensive hand met the challenge composedly at present youre doing it for me she reminded him and after all im not so disposed to agree with you not agree with me but you told me not to engage miss brent didnt you tell me not to engage her she made a hesitating motion of assent but good lord how was i to help myself no man was ever in such a quandary he broke off leaping back to the other side of the argument no she said looking up at him suddenly i believe that for the only time in your life you were sorry then that you hadnt married me she held his eyes for a moment with a look of gentle malice then he laughed and drew forth his cigarettecase oh come youve inverted the formula he said reaching out for the enamelled matchbox at his elbow she let the pleasantry pass with a slight smile and he went on reverting to his grievance why didnt you want me to engage miss brent oh i dont knowsome instinct you wont tell me i couldnt if i tried and now after all after all what she reflected youll have cicely off your mind i mean cicely off my mind mr langhope was beginning to find his charming friend less consolatory than usual after all the most magnanimous woman has her circuitous way of saying i told you so as if any good governess couldnt have done that for me he grumbled ah the present care for her but i was looking ahead she rejoined to what if i may ask the next few years when mrs amherst may have children of her own children of her own he bounded up furious at the suggestion had it never occurred to you hardly as a source of consolation i think a philosophic mind might find it so i should really be interested to know how mrs ansell put down her cup and again turned her gentle tolerant eyes upon him mr amherst as a father will take a more conservative view of his duties every one agrees that in spite of his theories he has a good head for business and whatever he does at westmore for the advantage of his children will naturally be for cicelys advantage too mr langhope returned her gaze thoughtfully theres something in what you say he admitted after a pause but it doesnt alter the fact that with amherst unmarried the whole of the westmore fortune would have gone back to cicely where it belongs possibly but it was so unlikely that he would remain unmarried i dont see why a man of honour would have felt bound to keep the money for cicely but you must remember that from mr amhersts standpoint the money belongs rather to westmore than to cicely hes no better than a socialist then well supposing he isnt the birth of a son and heir will cure that mr langhope winced but she persisted gently its really safer for cicely as it is and before the end of the conference he found himself confessing half against his will well since he hadnt the decency to remain single im thankful he hasnt inflicted a stranger on us and i shall never forget what miss brent did for my poor bessy it was the view she had wished to bring him to and the view which in due course with all his accustomed grace and adaptability he presented to the searching gaze of a society profoundly moved by the incident of amhersts marriage of course if mr langhope approves society reluctantly murmured and that mr langhope did approve was presently made manifest by every outward show of consideration toward the newlywedded couple amherst and justine had been married in september and after a holiday in canada and the adirondacks they returned to hanaford for the winter amherst had proposed a short flight to europe but his wife preferred to settle down at once to her new duties the announcement of her marriage had been met by mrs dressel with a comment which often afterward returned to her memory its splendid for you of course dear in one way her friend had murmured between disparagement and envy that is if you can stand talking about the westmore millhands all the rest of your life oh but i couldnt i should hate it justine had energetically rejoined meeting mrs dressels admonitory well then with the laughing assurance that she meant to lead the conversation she knew well enough what the admonition meant to amherst so long thwarted in his chosen work the subject of westmore was becoming

justine had guessed at his other side a side as long thwarted and far less articulate which she intended to wake into life she had felt it in him from the first though their talks had so uniformly turned on the subject which palled on hanaford and it had been revealed to her during the silent hours among his books when she had grown into such close intimacy with his mind she did not assuredly mean to spend the rest of her days talking about the westmore millhands but in the arrogance of her joy she wished to begin her married life in the setting of its habitual duties and to achieve the victory of evoking the secret unsuspected amherst out of the preoccupied business man chained to his task dull lovers might have to call on romantic scenes to wake romantic feelings but justines glancing imagination leapt to the challenge of extracting poetry from the prose of routine and this was precisely the triumph that the first months brought her to mortal eye amherst and justine seemed to be living at hanaford in reality they were voyaging on unmapped seas of adventure the seas were limitless and studded with happy islands every fresh discovery they made about each other every new agreement of ideas and feelings offered itself to these intrepid explorers as a friendly coast where they might beach their keel and take their bearings thus in the thronging hum of metaphor justine sometimes pictured their relation seeing it again as a journey through crowded populous cities where every face she met was amhersts or contrarily as a multiplication of points of perception so that one became for the worlds contact a surface so multitudinously alive that the old myth of hearing the grass grow and walking the rainbow explained itself as the heightening of personality to the utmost pitch of sympathy in reality the work at westmore became an almost necessary sedative after these flights into the blue she felt sometimes that they would have been bankrupted of sensations if daily hours of drudgery had not provided a reservoir in which fresh powers of enjoyment could slowly gather and their duties had the rarer quality of constituting precisely the deepest finest bond between them the clarifying element which saved their happiness from stagnation and kept it in the strong midcurrent of human feeling it was this element in their affection which in the last days of november was unexpectedly put on trial mr langhope since his return from his annual visit to europe showed signs of diminishing strength and elasticity he had had to give up his nightly dinner parties to desert his stall at the opera to take in short as he plaintively put it his social pleasures homoeopathically certain of his friends explained the change by saying that he had never been quite the same since his daughters death while others found its determining cause in the shock of amhersts second marriage but this insinuation mr langhope in due time discredited by writing to ask the amhersts if they would not pity his loneliness and spend the winter in town with him the proposal came in a letter to justine which she handed to her husband one afternoon on his return from the mills she sat behind the teatable in the westmore drawingroom now at last transformed not into mrs dressels vision of something lovely in louis seize but into a warm yet sober setting for books for scattered flowers for deep chairs and shaded lamps in pleasant nearness to each other amherst raised his eyes from the letter thinking as he did so how well her bright head with its flamelike play of meanings fitted into the background she had made for it still unobservant of external details he was beginning to feel a vague wellbeing of the eye wherever her touch had passed well we must do it he said simply oh must we she murmured holding out his cup he smiled at her note of dejection unnatural woman new york versus hanaford do you really dislike it so much she tried to bring a tone of consent into her voice i shall be very glad to be with cicely again and that of course she reflected is the reason why mr langhope wants us well if it is its a good reason yes but how much shall you be with us if you say so ill arrange to get away for a month or two oh no i dont want that she said with a smile that triumphed a little but why should not cicely come here if mr langhope is cut off from his usual amusements im afraid that would only make him more lonely yes i suppose so she put aside her untasted cup resting her elbows on her knees and her chin on her clasped hands in the attitude habitual to her in moments of inward debate amherst rose and seated himself on the sofa beside her dear what is it he said drawing her hands down so that she had to turn her face to his nothingi dont knowa superstition ive been so happy here is our happiness too perishable to be transplanted she smiled and answered by another question you dont mind doing it then amherst hesitated shall i tell you i feel that its a sort of ring of polycrates it may buy off the jealous gods a faint shrinking from some importunate suggestion seemed to press her closer to him then you feel they are jealous she breathed in a halflaugh i pity them if theyre not yes she agreed rallying to his tone i only had a fancy that they might overlook such a dull place as hanaford amherst drew her to him isnt it on the contrary in the ashheaps that the ragpickers prowl there was no disguising it she was growing afraid of her happiness her husbands analogy of the ring expressed her fear she seemed to herself to carry a blazing jewel on her breast something that singled her out for human envy and divine pursuit she had a preposterous longing to dress plainly and shabbily to subdue her voice and gestures to try to slip through life unnoticed yet all the while she knew that her jewel would shoot its rays through every disguise and from the depths of ancient atavistic instincts came the hope that amherst was right that by sacrificing their precious solitude to mr langhopes convenience they might still deceive the gods once pledged to her new task justine as usual espoused it with ardour it was pleasant even among greater joys to see her husband again frankly welcomed by mr langhope to see cicely bloom into happiness at their coming and to overhear mr langhope exclaim in a confidential aside to his

it he was prodigal of delicate attentions the experiment in short was a complete success and even amhersts necessary weeks at hanaford had the merit of giving a finer flavour to his brief appearances of all this justine was thinking as she drove down fifth avenue one january afternoon to meet her husband at the grand central station she had tamed her happiness at last the quality of fear had left it and it nestled in her heart like some wild creature subdued to human ways and as her inward bliss became more and more a quiet habit of the mind the longing to help and minister returned absorbing her more deeply in her husbands work she dismissed the carriage at the station and when his train had arrived they emerged together into the cold winter twilight and turned up madison avenue these walks home from the station gave them a little more time to themselves than if they had driven and there was always so much to tell on both sides this time the news was all good the work at westmore was prospering and on justines side there was a more cheerful report of mr langhopes health and best of all his promise to give them cicely for the summer amherst and justine were both anxious that the child should spend more time at hanaford that her young associations should begin to gather about westmore and justine exulted in the fact that the suggestion had come from mr langhope himself while she and amherst were still planning how to lead him up to it they reached the house while this triumph was still engaging them and in the doorway amherst turned to her with a smile and of course dear man he believes the idea is all his theres nothing you cant make people believe you little jesuit i dont think there is she boasted falling gaily into his tone and then as the door opened and she entered the hall her eyes fell on a blotted envelope which lay among the letters on the table the parlourmaid proffered it with a word of explanation a gentleman left it for you madam he asked to see you and said hed call for the answer in a day or two another begging letter i suppose said amherst turning into the drawingroom where mr langhope and cicely awaited them and justine carelessly pushing the envelope into her muff murmured i suppose so as she followed him xxxiii over the teatable justine forgot the note in her muff but when she went upstairs to dress it fell to the floor and she picked it up and laid it on her dressingtable she had already recognized the hand as wyants for it was not the first letter she had received from him three times since her marriage he had appealed to her for help excusing himself on the plea of difficulties and illhealth the first time he wrote he alluded vaguely to having married and to being compelled through illness to give up his practice at clifton on receiving this letter she made enquiries and learned that a month or two after her departure from lynbrook wyant had married a clifton girl a pretty piece of flaunting innocence whom she remembered about the lanes generally with a young man in a buggy there had evidently been something obscure and precipitate about the marriage which was a strange one for the ambitious young doctor justine conjectured that it might have been the cause of his leaving clifton or or perhaps he had already succumbed to the fatal habit she had suspected in him at any rate he seemed in some mysterious way to have dropped in two years from promise to failure yet she could not believe that with his talents and the name he had begun to make such a lapse could be more than temporary she had often heard dr garford prophesy great things for him but dr garford had died suddenly during the previous summer and the loss of this powerful friend was mentioned by wyant among his misfortunes justine was anxious to help him but her marriage to a rich man had not given her the command of much money she and amherst choosing to regard themselves as pensioners on the westmore fortune were scrupulous in restricting their personal expenditure and her work among the millhands brought many demands on the modest allowance which her husband had insisted on her accepting in reply to wyants first appeal which reached her soon after her marriage she had sent him a hundred dollars but when the second came some two months later with a fresh tale of illluck and illhealth she had not been able to muster more than half the amount finally a third letter had arrived a short time before their leaving for new york it told the same story of persistent misfortune but on this occasion wyant instead of making a direct appeal for money suggested that through her hospital connections she should help him to establish a new york practice his tone was halfwhining halfperemptory his once precise writing smeared and illegible and these indications combined with her former suspicions convinced her that for the moment he was unfit for medical work at any rate she could not assume the responsibility of recommending him and in answering she advised him to apply to some of the physicians he had worked with at lynbrook softening her refusal by the enclosure of a small sum of money to this letter she received no answer wyant doubtless found the money insufficient and resented her unwillingness to help him by the use of her influence and she felt sure that the note before her contained a renewal of his former request an obscure reluctance made her begin to undress before opening it she felt slightly tired and indolently happy and she did not wish any jarring impression to break in on the sense of completeness which her husbands coming always put into her life her happiness was making her timid and luxurious she was beginning to shrink from even trivial annoyances but when at length in her dressinggown her loosened hair about her shoulders she seated herself before the toiletmirror wyants note once more confronted her it was absurd to put off reading it if he asked for money again she would simply confide the whole business to amherst she had never spoken to her husband of her correspondence with wyant the mere fact that the latter had appealed to her instead of addressing himself to amherst made her suspect that he had a weakness to hide and counted on her professional discretion but his continued importunities would certainly release her from any such supposed obligation and she thought with relief of casting the weight of her difficulty on her husbands shoulders she opened the note and read i did not acknowledge your last letter because i was ashamed to tell you that the money was not enough to be of any use but i am past shame now my wife was confined three weeks ago and has been desperately ill ever since she is in no state to move but we shall be put out of these rooms unless i can get money or work at once a word from you would have given me a start in new york and id be willing to begin again as an interne or a doctors assistant i have never reminded you of what you owe me and i should not do so now if i hadnt been to hell and back since i saw you but i suppose you would rather have me remind you than apply to mr amherst you can tell me when to call for my answer justine laid down the letter and looked up her eyes rested on her own reflection in the glass and it frightened her she sat motionless with a thicklybeating heart one hand clenched on the letter i suppose you would rather have me remind you than apply to mr amherst that was what his importunity meant then she had been paying blackmail all this time somewhere from the first in an obscure fold of consciousness she had felt the stir of an unnamed unacknowledged fear and now the fear raised its head and looked at her well she would look back at it then look it straight in the malignant eye what was it after all but a bugbear to scare children the ghost of the opinion of the many she had suspected from the first that wyant knew of her having shortened the term of bessy amhersts sufferings returning to the room when he did it was almost impossible that he should not have guessed what had happened and his silence had made her believe that he understood her motive and approved it but supposing she had been mistaken she still had nothing to fear since she had done nothing that her own conscience condemned if the act were to do again she would do it she had never known a moments regret suddenly she heard amhersts step in the passage heard him laughing and talking as he chased cicely up the stairs to the nursery if she was not afraid why had she never told amherst why the answer to that was simple enough she had not told him because she was not afraid from the first she had retained sufficient detachment to view her act impartially to find it completely justified by circumstances and to decide that since those circumstances could be but partly and indirectly known to her husband she not only had the right to keep her own counsel but was actually under a kind of obligation not to force on him the knowledge of a fact that he could not alter and could not completely judge was there any flaw in this line of reasoning did it not show a deliberate weighing of conditions a perfect rectitude of intention and after all she had had amhersts virtual consent to her act she knew his feelings on such matters his independence of traditional judgments his horror of inflicting needless pain she was as sure of his intellectual assent as of her own she was even sure that when she told him he would appreciate her reasons for not telling him before for now of course he must know everything this horrible letter made it inevitable she regretted that she had decided though for the best of reasons not to speak to him of her own accord for it was intolerable that he should think of any external pressure as having brought her to avowal but no he would not think that the understanding between them was so complete that no deceptive array of circumstances could ever make her motives obscure to him she let herself rest a moment in the thought presently she heard him moving in the next room he had come back to dress for dinner she would go to him now at once she could not bear this weight on her mind the whole evening she pushed back her chair crumpling the letter in her hand but as she did so her eyes again fell on her reflection she could not go to her husband with such a face if she was not afraid why did she look like that well she was afraid it would be easier and simpler to admit it she was afraid afraid for the first time afraid for her own happiness she had had just eight months of happiness it was horrible to think of losing it so soon losing it but why should she lose it the letter must have affected her brainall her thoughts were in a blur of fear fear of what of the man who understood her as no one else understood her the man to whose wisdom and mercy she trusted as the believer trusts in god this was a kind of abominable nightmare even amhersts image had been distorted in her mind the only way to clear her brain to recover the normal sense of things was to go to him now at once to feel his arms about her to let his kiss dispel her fears she rose with a long breath of relief she had to cross the length of the room to reach his door and when she had gone halfway she heard him knock may i come in she was close to the fireplace and a bright fire burned on the hearth come in she answered and as she did so she turned and dropped wyants letter into the fire her hand had crushed it into a little ball and she saw the flames spring up and swallow it before her husband entered it was not that she had changed her mind she still meant to tell him everything but to hold the letter was like holding a venomous snake she wanted to exterminate it to forget that she had ever seen the blotted repulsive characters and she could not bear to have amhersts eyes rest on it to have him know that any man had dared to write to her in that tone what vile meanings might not be read between wyants phrases she had a right to tell the story in her own way the true way as amherst approached in his evening clothes the heavy locks smoothed from his forehead a flower of cicelys giving in his buttonhole she thought she had never seen him look so kind and handsome not dressed do you know that its ten minutes to eight he said coming up to her with a smile she roused herself putting her hands to her hair yes i know i forgot she murmured longing to feel his arms about her but standing rooted to the ground unable to move an inch nearer it was he who came close drawing her lifted hands into his you look worried i hope it was nothing troublesome that made you forget the divine kindness in his voice his eyes yes it would be easy quite easy to tell him no yes i was a little troubled she said feeling the warmth of his touch flow through her hands reassuringly dear what about she drew a deep breath the letter he looked puzzled what letter downstairswhen we came init was not an ordinary beggingletter no what then he asked his face clouding she noticed the change and it frightened her was he angry was he going to be angry but how absurd he was only distressed at her distress what then he repeated more gently she looked up into his eyes for an instant it was a horrible letter she whispered as she pressed her clasped hands against him his grasp tightened on her wrists and again the stern look crossed his face horrible what do you mean she had never seen him angry but she felt suddenly that to the guilty creature his anger would be terrible he would crush wyant she must be careful how she spoke i didnt mean that only painful where is the letter let me see it oh no she exclaimed shrinking away justine what has happened what ails you on a blind impulse she had backed toward the hearth propping her arms against the mantelpiece while she stole a secret glance at the embers nothing remained of it no nothing but suppose it was against herself that his anger turned the idea was preposterous yet she trembled at it it was clear that she must say something at once must somehow account for her agitation but the sense that she was unnerved no longer in control of her face her voice made her feel that she would tell her story badly if she told it now had she not the right to gain a respite to choose her own hour weakness weakness again every delay would only increase the phantom terror now now with her head on his breast she turned toward him and began to speak impulsively i cant show you the letter because its not not my secret ah he murmured perceptibly relieved its from some one unlucky whom ive known about and whose troubles have been troubling you but cant we help she shone on him through gleaming lashes some one poor and ill who needs money i mean she tried to laugh away her tears and i havent any thats my trouble foolish child and to beg you are ashamed and so youre letting your tears cool mr langhopes soup he had her in his arms now his kisses drying her cheek and she turned her head so that their lips met in a long pressure will a hundred dollars do he asked with a smile as he released her a hundred dollars no she was almost sure they would not but she tried to shape a murmur of gratitude thank you thank you i hated to ask ill write the cheque at once no no she protested theres no hurry but he went back to his room and she turned again to the toilettable her face was painful to look at still but a light was breaking through its fear she felt the touch of a narcotic in her veins how calm and peaceful the room was and how delicious to think that her life would go on in it safely and peacefully in the old familiar way as she swept up her hair passing the comb through it and flinging it dexterously over her lifted wrist she heard amherst cross the floor behind her and pause to lay something on her writingtable thank you she murmured again lowering her head as he passed when the door had closed on him she thrust the last pin into her hair dashed some drops of cologne on her face and went over to the writingtable as she picked up the cheque she saw it was for three hundred dollars xxxiv once or twice in the days that followed justine found herself thinking that she had never known happiness before the old state of secure wellbeing seemed now like a dreamless sleep but this new bliss on its sharp pinnacle ringed with fire this thrilling conscious joy daily and hourly snatched from fear this was living not sleeping wyant acknowledged her gift with profuse almost servile thanks she had sent it without a word saying to herself that pity for his situation made it possible to ignore his baseness and the days went on as before she was not conscious of any change save in the heightened almost artificial quality of her happiness till one day in march when mr langhope announced that he was going for two or three weeks to a friends shootingbox in the south the anniversary of bessys death was approaching and justine knew that at that time he always absented himself supposing you and amherst were to carry off cicely till i come back perhaps you could persuade him to break away from work for once or if thats impossible you could take her with you to hanaford she looks a little pale and the change would be good for her this was a great concession on mr langhopes part and justine saw the pleasure in her husbands face it was the first time that his fatherinlaw had suggested cicelys going to hanaford im afraid i cant break away just now sir amherst said but it will be delightful for justine if youll give us cicely while youre away take her by all means my dear fellow i always sleep on both ears when shes with your wife it was nearly three months since justine had left hanaford and now she was to return there alone with her husband there would be hours of course when the childs presence was between them or when again his work would keep him at the mills but in the evenings when cicely was in bed when he and she sat alone together in the westmore drawingroom in bessys drawingroom no she must find some excuse for remaining away till she had again grown used to the idea of being alone with amherst every day she was growing a little more used to it but it would take time time and the full assurance that wyant was silenced till then she could not go back to hanaford she found a pretext in her own health she pleaded that she was a little tired below parand to return to hanaford meant returning to hard work with the best will in the world she could not be idle there might she not she suggested take cicely to tuxedo or lakewood and thus get quite away from household cares and good works the pretext rang hollow it was so unlike her she saw amhersts eyes rest anxiously on her as mr langhope uttered his prompt assent certainly she did look tired mr langhope himself had noticed it had he perhaps overtaxed her energies left the household too entirely on her shoulders oh no it was only the new york airlike cicely she pined for a breath of the woods and so the day mr langhope left she and cicely were packed off to lakewood they stayed there a week then a fit of restlessness drove justine back to town she found an excuse in the constant rain it was really useless as she wrote mr langhope to keep the child imprisoned in an overheated hotel while they could get no benefit from the outdoor life in reality she found the long lonely hours unendurable she pined for a sight of her husband and thought of committing cicely to mrs ansells care and making a sudden dash for hanaford but the vision of the long evenings in the westmore drawingroom again restrained her no she would simply go back to new york dine out occasionally go to a concert or two trust to the usual demands of town life to crowd her hours with small activities and in another week mr langhope would be back and the days would resume their normal course on arriving she looked feverishly through the letters in the hall none from wyant that fear was allayed every day added to her reassurance by this time no doubt he was on his feet again and ashamed unutterably ashamed of the threat that despair had wrung from him she felt almost sure that his shame would keep him from ever attempting to see her or even from writing again a gentleman called to see you yesterday madam he would give no name the parlourmaid said and there was the sick fear back on her again she could hardly control the trembling of her lips as she asked did he leave no message no madam he only wanted to know when youd be back she longed to return and did you tell him but restrained herself and passed into the drawingroom after all the parlourmaid had not described the caller why jump to the conclusion that it was wyant three days passed and no letter came no sign she struggled with the temptation to describe wyant to the servants and to forbid his admission but it would not do they were nearly all old servants in whose eyes she was still the intruder the upstart sicknurse she could not wholly trust them and each day she felt a little easier a little more convinced that the unknown visitor had not been wyant on the fourth day she received a letter from amherst he hoped to be back on the morrow but as his plans were still uncertain he would telegraph in the morning and meanwhile she must keep well and rest and amuse herself amuse herself that evening as it happened she was going to the theatre with mrs ansell she and mrs ansell though outwardly on perfect terms had not greatly advanced in intimacy the agitated decentralized life of the older woman seemed futile and trivial to justine but on mr langhopes account she wished to keep up an appearance of friendship with his friend and the same motive doubtless inspired mrs ansell just now at any rate justine was grateful for her attentions and glad to go about with her anything anything to get away from her own thoughts that was the pass she had come to at the theatre in a proscenium box the publicity the light and movement the action of the play all helped to distract and quiet her at such moments she grew ashamed of her fears why was she tormenting herself if anything happened she had only to ask her husband for more money she never spoke to him of her good works and there would be nothing to excite suspicion in her asking help again for the friend whose secret she was pledged to keep but nothing was going to happen as the play progressed and the stimulus of talk and laughter flowed through her veins she felt a complete return of confidence and then suddenly she glanced across the house and saw wyant looking at her he sat rather far back in one of the side rows just beneath the balcony so that his face was partly shaded but even in the shadow it frightened her she had been prepared for a change but not for this ghastly deterioration and he continued to look at her she began to be afraid that he would do something conspicuous point at her or stand up in his seat she thought he looked halfmad or was it her own hallucination that made him appear so she and mrs ansell were alone in the box for the moment and she started up pushing back her chair mrs ansell leaned forward what is it nothing the heat ill sit back for a moment but as she withdrew into the back of the box she was seized by a new fear if he was still watching might he not come to the door and try to speak to her her only safety lay in remaining in full view of the audience and she returned to mrs ansells side the other members of the party came back the bell rang the footlights blazed the curtain rose she lost herself in the mazes of the play she sat so motionless her face so intently turned toward the stage that the muscles at the back of her neck began to stiffen and then quite suddenly toward the middle of the act she felt an undefinable sense of relief she could not tell what caused it but slowly cautiously while the eyes of the others were intent upon the stage she turned her head and looked toward wyants seat it was empty her first thought was that he had gone to wait for her outside but no there were two more acts why should he stand at the door for half the evening at last the act ended the entracte elapsed the play went on again and still the seat was empty gradually she persuaded herself that she had been mistaken in thinking that the man who had occupied it was wyant her selfcommand returned she began to think and talk naturally to follow the dialogue on the stage and when the evening was over and mrs ansell set her down at her door she had almost forgotten her fears the next morning she felt calmer than for many days she was sure now that if wyant had wished to speak to her he would have waited at the door of the theatre and the recollection of his miserable face made apprehension yield to pity she began to feel that she had treated him coldly uncharitably they had been friends once as well as fellowworkers but she had been false even to the comradeship of the hospital she should have sought him out and given him sympathy as well as money had she shown some sign of human kindness his last letter might never have been written in the course of the morning amherst telegraphed that he hoped to settle his business in time to catch the two oclock express but that his plans were still uncertain justine and cicely lunched alone and after luncheon the little girl was despatched to her dancingclass justine herself meant to go out when the brougham returned she went up to her room to dress planning to drive in the park and to drop in on mrs ansell before she called for cicely but on the way downstairs she saw the servant opening the door to a visitor it was too late to draw back and descending the last steps she found herself face to face with wyant they looked at each other a moment in silence then justine murmured a word of greeting and led the way to the drawingroom it was a snowy afternoon and in the raw ashcoloured light she thought he looked more changed than at the theatre she remarked too that his clothes were worn and untidy his gloveless hands soiled and tremulous none of the degrading signs of his infirmity were lacking and she saw at once that while in the early days of the habit he had probably mixed his drugs so that the conflicting symptoms neutralized each other he had now sunk into open morphiataking she felt profoundly sorry for him yet as he followed her into the room physical repulsion again mastered the sense of pity but where action was possible she was always selfcontrolled and she turned to him quietly as they seated themselves i have been wishing to see you she said looking at him i have felt that i ought to have done so sooner to have told you how sorry i am for your bad luck he returned her glance with surprise they were evidently the last words he had expected youre very kind he said in a low embarrassed voice he had kept on his shabby overcoat and he twirled his hat in his hands as he spoke i have felt justine continued that perhaps a talk with you might be of more use he raised his head fixing her with bright narrowed eyes i have felt so too thats my reason for coming you sent me a generous present some weeks ago but i dont want to go on living on charity i understand that she answered but why have you had to do so wont you tell me just what has happened she felt the words to be almost a mockery yet she could not say i read your history at a glance and she hoped that her question might draw out his wretched secret and thus give her the chance to speak frankly he gave a nervous laugh just what has happened its a long story and some of the details are not particularly pretty he broke off moving his hat more rapidly through his trembling hands never mind tell me well after you all left lynbrook i had rather a bad breakdown the strain of mrs amhersts case i suppose you remember bramble the clifton grocer miss bramble nursed me i daresay you remember her too when i recovered i married her and after that things didnt go well he paused breathing quickly and looking about the room with odd furtive glances i was only halfwell anyhow i couldnt attend to my patients properly and after a few months we decided to leave clifton and i bought a practice in new jersey but my wife was ill there and things went wrong again damnably i suppose youve guessed that my marriage was a mistake she had an idea that we should do better in new york so we came here a few months ago and weve done decidedly worse justine listened with a sense of discouragement she saw now that he did not mean to acknowledge his failing and knowing the secretiveness of the drugtaker she decided that he was deluded enough to think he could still deceive her well he began again with an attempt at jauntiness ive found out that in my profession its a hard struggle to get on your feet again after illness or or any bad setback thats the reason i asked you to say a word for me its not only the money though i need that badly i want to get back my selfrespect with my record i oughtnt to be where i am and you can speak for me better than any one why better than the doctors youve worked with justine put the question abruptly looking him straight in the eyes his glance dropped and an unpleasant flush rose to his thin cheeks well as it happens youre better situated than any one to help me to the particular thing i want the particular thing yes i understand that mr langhope and mrs ansell are both interested in the new wing for paying patients at saint christophers i want the position of housephysician there and i know you can get it for me his tone changed as he spoke till with the last words it became rough and almost menacing justine felt her colour rise and her heart began to beat confusedly here was the truth then she could no longer be the dupe of her own compassion the man knew his power and meant to use it but at the thought her courage was in arms im sorry but its impossible she said impossible why she continued to look at him steadily you said just now that you wished to regain your selfrespect well you must regain it before you can ask me or any one else to recommend you to a position of trust wyant halfrose with an angry murmur my selfrespect what do you mean i meant that id lost courage through illluck yes and your illluck has come through your own fault till you cure yourself youre not fit to cure others he sank back into his seat glowering at her under sullen brows then his expression gradually changed to halfsneering admiration youre a plucky one he said justine repressed a movement of disgust i am very sorry for you she said gravely i saw this trouble coming on you long ago and if there is any other way in which i can help you thanks he returned still sneering your sympathy is very precious there was a time when i would have given my soul for it but thats over and im here to talk business you say you saw my trouble coming on did it ever occur to you that you were the cause of it justine glanced at him with frank contempt no for i was not she replied thats an easy way out of it but you took everything from me first my hope of marrying you then my chance of a big success in my career and i was desperate weak if you like and tried to deaden my feelings in order to keep up my pluck justine rose to her feet with a movement of impatience every word you say proves how unfit you are to assume any responsibility to do anything but try to recover your health if i can help you to that i am still willing to do so wyant rose also moving a step nearer well get me that place then ill see to the rest ill keep straight no its impossible you wont i cant she repeated firmly and you expect to put me off with that answer she hesitated yes if theres no other help youll accept he laughed again his feeble sneering laugh was disgusting oh i dont say that id like to earn my living honestly funny preference but if you cut me off from that i suppose its only fair to let you make up for it my wife and child have got to live you choose a strange way of helping them but i will do what i can if you will go for a while to some institution he broke in furiously institution be damned you cant shuffle me out of the way like that im all right good food is what i need you think ive got morphia in me why its hunger justine heard him with a renewal of pity oh im sorry for you very sorry why do you try to deceive me why do you deceive me you know what i want and you know youve got to let me have it if you wont give me a line to one of your friends at saint christophers youll have to give me another cheque thats the size of it as they faced each other in silence justines pity gave way to a sudden hatred for the poor creature who stood shivering and sneering before her you choose the wrong tone and i think our talk has lasted long enough she said stretching her hand to the bell wyant did not move dont ring unless you want me to write to your husband he rejoined a sick feeling of helplessness overcame her but she turned on him firmly i pardoned you once for that threat yes and you sent me some money the next day i was mistaken enough to think that in your distress you had not realized what you wrote but if youre a systematic blackmailer gently gently bad names dont frighten me its hunger and debt im afraid of justine felt a last tremor of compassion he was abominable but he was pitiable too i will really help you i will see your wife and do what i can but i can give you no money today why not because i have none i am not as rich as you think he smiled incredulously give me a line to mr langhope then no he sat down once more leaning back with a weak assumption of ease perhaps mr amherst will think differently she whitened but said steadily mr amherst is away very well i can write for the last five minutes justine had foreseen this threat and had tried to force her mind to face dispassionately the chances it involved after all why not let him write to amherst the very vileness of the deed must rouse an indignation which would be all in her favour would inevitably dispose her husband to readier sympathy with the motive of her act as contrasted with the base insinuations of her slanderer it seemed impossible that amherst should condemn her when his condemnation involved the fulfilling of wyants calculations a reaction of scorn would throw him into unhesitating championship of her conduct all this was so clear that had she been advising any one else her confidence in the course to be taken might have strengthened the feeblest will but with the question lying between herself and amherst with the vision of those soiled hands literally laid on the spotless fabric of her happiness judgment wavered foresight was obscured she felt tremulously unable to face the steps between exposure and vindication her final conclusion was that she must at any rate gain time buy off wyant till she had been able to tell her story in her own way and at her own hour and then defy him when he returned to the assault the idea that whatever concession she made would be only provisional helped to excuse the weakness of making it and enabled her at last without too painful a sense of falling below her own standards to reply in a low voice if youll go now i will send you something next week but wyant did not respond as readily as she had expected he merely asked without altering his insolently easy attitude how much unless its a good deal i prefer the letter oh why could she not cry out leave the house at once your vulgar threats are nothing to me why could she not even say in her own heart i will tell my husband tonight youre afraid said wyant as if answering her thought whats the use of being afraid when you can make yourself comfortable so easily you called me a systematic blackmailer well im not that yet give me a thousand and youll see the last of me on what used to be my honour justines heart sank she had reached the point of being ready to appeal again to amherst but on what pretext could she ask for such a sum in a lifeless voice she said i could not possibly get more than one or two hundred wyant scrutinized her a moment her despair must have rung true to him well you must have something of your own i saw your jewelry last night at the theatre he said so it had been he and he had sat there appraising her value like a murderer jewelry she faltered you had a thumping big sapphire wasnt it with diamonds round it it was her only jewel amhersts marriage gift she would have preferred a less valuable present but his mother had persuaded her to accept it saying that it was the brides duty to adorn herself for the bridegroom i will give you nothing she was about to exclaim when suddenly her eyes fell on the clock if amherst had caught the two oclock express he would be at the house within the hour and the only thing that seemed of consequence now was that he should not meet wyant supposing she still found courage to refuse there was no knowing how long the humiliating scene might be prolonged and she must be rid of the creature at any cost after all she seldom wore the sapphire months might pass without its absence being noted by amhersts careless eye and if wyant should pawn it she might somehow save money to buy it back before it was missed she went through these calculations with feverish rapidity then she turned again to wyant you wont come back ever i swear i wont he said he moved away toward the window as if to spare her and she turned and slowly left the room she never forgot the moments that followed once outside the door she was in such haste that she stumbled on the stairs and had to pause on the landing to regain her breath in her room she found one of the housemaids busy and at first could think of no pretext for dismissing her then she bade the woman go down and send the brougham away telling the coachman to call for miss cicely at six left alone she bolted the door and as if with a thiefs hand opened her wardrobe unlocked her jewelbox and drew out the sapphire in its flat morocco case she restored the box to its place the key to its ring then she opened the case and looked at the sapphire as she did so a little tremor ran over her neck and throat and closing her eyes she felt her husbands kiss and the touch of his hands as he fastened on the jewel she unbolted the door listened intently on the landing and then went slowly down the stairs none of the servants were in sight yet as she reached the lower hall she was conscious that the air had grown suddenly colder as though the outer door had just been opened she paused and listened again there was a sound of talking in the drawingroom could it be that in her absence a visitor had been admitted the possibility frightened her at first then she welcomed it as an unexpected means of ridding herself of her tormentor she opened the drawingroom door and saw her husband talking with wyant xxxv amherst his back to the threshold sat at a table writing wyant stood a few feet away staring down at the fire neither had heard the door open and before they were aware of her entrance justine had calculated that she must have been away for at least five minutes and that in that space of time almost anything might have passed between them for a moment the power of connected thought left her then her heart gave a bound of relief she said to herself that wyant had doubtless made some allusion to his situation and that her husband conscious only of a great debt of gratitude had at once sat down to draw a cheque for him the idea was so reassuring that it restored all her clearness of thought wyant was the first to see her he made an abrupt movement and amherst rising turned and put an envelope in his hand there my dear fellow as he turned he caught sight of his wife i caught the twelve oclock train after all you got my second wire he asked no she faltered pressing her left hand with the little case in it close to the folds of her dress i was afraid not there was a bad storm at hanaford and they said there might be a delay at the same moment she found wyant advancing with extended hand and understood that he had concealed the fact of having already seen her she accepted the cue and shook his hand murmuring how do you do amherst looked at her perhaps struck by her manner you have not seen dr wyant since lynbrook no she answered thankful to have this pretext for her emotion i have been telling him that he should not have left us so long without news especially as he has been ill and things have gone rather badly with him but i hope we can help now he has heard that saint christophers is looking for a housephysician for the paying patients wing and as mr langhope is away i have given him a line to mrs ansell extremely kind of you wyant murmured passing his hand over his forehead justine stood silent she wondered that her husband had not noticed that tremulous degraded hand but he was always so blind to externals and he had no medical experience to sharpen his perceptions suddenly she felt impelled to speak i am sorry dr wyant has been unfortunate of course you will want to do everything to help him but would it not be better to wait till mr langhope comes back wyant thinks the delay might make him lose the place it seems the board meets tomorrow and mrs ansell really knows much more about it isnt she the secretary of the ladies committee im not sure i believe so but surely mr langhope should be consulted she felt wyants face change his eyes settled on her in a threatening stare amherst looked at her also and there was surprise in his glance i think i can answer for my fatherinlaw he feels as strongly as i do how much we all owe to dr wyant he seldom spoke of mr langhope as his fatherinlaw and the chance designation seemed to mark a closer tie between them to exclude justine from what was after all a family affair for a moment she felt tempted to accept the suggestion and let the responsibility fall where it would but it would fall on amherst and that was intolerable i think you ought to wait she insisted an embarrassed silence settled on the three wyant broke it by advancing toward amherst i shall never forget your kindness he said and i hope to prove to mrs amherst that its not misplaced the words were well chosen and well spoken justine saw that they produced a good effect amherst grasped the physicians hand with a smile my dear fellow i wish i could do more be sure to call on me again if you want help oh youve put me on my feet said wyant gratefully he bowed slightly to justine and turned to go but as he reached the threshold she moved after him dr wyant you must give back that letter he stopped short with a whitening face she felt amhersts eyes on her again and she said desperately addressing him dr wyant understands my reasons her husbands glance turned abruptly to wyant do you he asked after a pause wyant looked from one to the other the moisture came out on his forehead and he passed his hand over it again yes he said in a dry voice mrs amherst wants me farther off out of new york out of new york what do you mean justine interposed hastily before the answer could come it is because dr wyant is not in condition for such a place just at present but he assures me he is quite well there was another silence and again wyant broke in this time with a slight laugh i can explain what mrs amherst means she intends to accuse me of the morphine habit and i can explain her reason for doing so she wants me out of the way amherst turned on the speaker and as she had foreseen his look was terrible you havent explained that yet he said well i can wyant waited another moment i know too much about her he declared there was a low exclamation from justine and amherst strode toward wyant you infernal blackguard he cried oh gently wyant muttered flinching back from his outstretched arm my wifes wish is sufficient give me back that letter wyant straightened himself no by god i wont he retorted furiously i didnt ask you for it till you offered to help me but i wont let it be taken back without a word like a thief that youd caught with your umbrella if your wife wont explain i will shes afraid ill talk about what happened at lynbrook amhersts arm fell to his side at lynbrook behind him there was a sound of inarticulate appeal but he took no notice yes its she who used morphia but not on herself she gives it to other people she gave an overdose to mrs amherst amherst looked at him confusedly an overdose yes purposely i mean and i came into the room at the wrong time i can prove that mrs amherst died of morphiapoisoning john justine gasped out pressing between them amherst gently put aside the hand with which she had caught his arm wait a moment this cant rest here you cant want it to he said to her in an undertone why do you carefor what he sayswhen i dont she breathed back with trembling lips you can see i am not wanted here wyant threw in with a sneer amherst remained silent for a brief space then he turned his eyes once more to his wife justine lifted her face it looked small and spent like an extinguished taper its true she said true i did givean overdoseintentionally when i knew there was no hope and when the surgeons said she might go on suffering she was very strongand i couldnt bear ityou couldnt have borne it there was another silence then she went on in a stronger voice looking straight at her husband and now will you send this man away amherst glanced at wyant without moving go he said curtly wyant instead moved a step nearer just a minute please its only fair to hear my side your wife says there was no hope yet the day before shegave the dose dr garford told her in my presence that mrs amherst might live again amhersts eyes addressed themselves slowly to justine and she forced her lips to articulate an answer dr garford saidone could never tellbut i know he didnt believe in the chance of recoveryno one did dr garford is dead said wyant grimly amherst strode up to him again you scoundrel leave the house he commanded but still wyant sneeringly stood his ground not till ive finished i cant afford to let myself be kicked out like a dog because i happen to be in the way every doctor knows that in cases of spinal lesion recovery is becoming more and more frequent if the patient survives the third week theres every reason to hope those are the facts as they would appear to any surgeon if theyre not true why is mrs amherst afraid of having them stated why has she been paying me for nearly a year to keep them quiet oh justine moaned i never thought of talking till luck went against me then i asked her for help and reminded her of certain things after that she kept me supplied pretty regularly he thrust his shaking hand into an inner pocket here are her envelopesquebecmontrealsaranaci know just where you went on your honeymoon she had to write often because the sums were small why did she do it if she wasnt afraid and why did she go upstairs just now to fetch me something if you dont believe me ask her what shes got in her hand amherst did not heed this injunction he stood motionless gripping the back of a chair as if his next gesture might be to lift and hurl it at the speaker ask her wyant repeated amherst turned his head slowly and his dull gaze rested on his wife his face looked years older lips and eyes moved as heavily as an old mans as he looked at her justine came forward without speaking and laid the little morocco case in his hand he held it there a moment as if hardly understanding her action then he tossed it on the table at his elbow and walked up to wyant you hound he said now go xxxvi when wyant had left the room and the housedoor had closed on him amherst spoke to his wife come upstairs he said justine followed him scarcely conscious where she went but moving already with a lighter tread part of her weight of misery had been lifted with wyants going she had suffered less from the fear of what her husband might think than from the shame of making her avowal in her defamers presence and her faith in amhersts comprehension had begun to revive he had dismissed wyant with scorn and horror did not that show that he was on her side already and how many more arguments she had at her call her brain hummed with them as she followed him up the stairs in her bedroom he closed the door and stood motionless the same heavy halfparalyzed look on his face it frightened her and she went up to him john she said timidly he put his hand to his head wait a moment he returned and she waited her heart slowly sinking again the moment over he seemed to recover his power of movement he crossed the room and threw himself into the armchair near the hearth now tell me everything he sat thrown back his eyes fixed on the fire and the vertical lines between his brows forming a deep scar in his white face justine moved nearer and touched his arm beseechingly wont you look at me he turned his head slowly as if with an effort and his eyes rested reluctantly on hers oh not like that she exclaimed he seemed to make a stronger effort at selfcontrol please dont heed me but say what there is to say he said in a level voice his gaze on the fire she stood before him her arms hanging down her clasped fingers twisting restlessly i dont know that there is much to say beyond what ive told you there was a slight sound in amhersts throat like the ghost of a derisive laugh after another interval he said i wish to hear exactly what happened she seated herself on the edge of a chair near by bending forward with hands interlocked and arms extended on her knees every line reaching out to him as though her whole slight body were an arrow winged with pleadings it was a relief to speak at last even face to face with the stony image that sat in her husbands place and she told her story detail by detail omitting nothing exaggerating nothing speaking slowly clearly with precision aware that the bare facts were her strongest argument amherst as he listened shifted his position once raising his hand so that it screened his face and in that attitude he remained when she had ended as she waited for him to speak justine realized that her heart had been alive with tremulous hopes all through her narrative she had counted on a murmur of perception an exclamation of pity she had felt sure of melting the stony image but amherst said no word at length he spoke still without turning his head you have not told me why you kept this from me a sob formed in her throat and she had to wait to steady her voice no that was my wrong my weakness when i did it i never thought of being afraid to tell you i had talked it over with you in my own mindso oftenbefore well then when you came back it was harderthough i was still sure you would approve me why harder because at first at lynbrook i could not tell it all over in detail as i have nowit was beyond human powerand without doing so i couldnt make it all clear to youand so should only have added to your pain if you had been there you would have done as i did i felt sure of that from the first but coming afterward you couldnt judgeno one who was not there could judgeand i wanted to spare you and afterward she had shrunk in advance from this question and she could not answer it at once to gain time she echoed it afterward did it never occur to you when we met later when you first went to mr langhope to tell you then no because by that time i had come to see that i could never be quite sure of making you understand no one who was not there at the time could know what it was to see her suffer you thought it all over then decided definitely against telling me i did not have to think long i felt i had done right i still feel so and i was sure you would feel so if you were in the same circumstances there was another pause then amherst said and last september at hanaford it was the word for which she had waited the word of her inmost fears she felt the blood mount to her face did you see no difference no special reason for telling me then yes she faltered yet you said nothing no silence again her eyes strayed to the clock and some dim association of ideas told her that cicely would soon be coming in why did you say nothing he lowered his hand and turned toward her as he spoke and she looked up and faced him because i regarded the question as settled i had decided it in my own mind months before and had never regretted my decision i should have thought it morbidunnaturalto go over the whole subject againto let it affect a situation that had come aboutso much laterso unexpectedly did you never feel that later if i came to know if others came to know it might be difficult no for i didnt care for the others and i believed that whatever your own feelings were you would know i had done what i thought right she spoke the words proudly strongly and for the first time the hard lines of his face relaxed and a slight tremor crossed it if you believed this why have you been letting that cur blackmail you because when he began i saw for the first time that what i had done might be turned against me by by those who disliked our marriage and i was afraid for my happiness that was my weaknessit is what i am suffering for now suffering he echoed ironically as though she had presumed to apply to herself a word of which he had the grim monopoly he rose and took a few aimless steps then he halted before her that day last month when you asked me for moneywas it yes she said her head sinking he laughed you couldnt tell me but you could use my money to bribe that fellow to conspire with you i had none of my own no nor i either you used her money god he groaned turning away with clenched hands justine had risen also and she stood motionless her hands clasped against her breast in the drawn shrinking attitude of a fugitive overtaken by a blinding storm he moved back to her with an appealing gesture and you didnt see it didnt occur to you that your doingas you didwas an obstacle an insurmountable obstacle to our ever she cut him short with an indignant cry no no for it was not how could it have anything to do with whatcame afterwith you or me i did it only for bessy it concerned only bessy ah dont name her broke from him harshly and she drew back cut to the heart there was another pause during which he seemed to fall into a kind of dazed irresolution his head on his breast as though unconscious of her presence then he roused himself and went to the door as he passed her she sprang after him john john is that all you have to say what more is there what more everything what right have you to turn from me as if i were a murderess i did nothing but what your own reason your own arguments have justified a hundred times i made a mistake in not telling you at once but a mistake is not a crime it cant be your real feeling that turns you from me it must be the dread of what other people would think but when have you cared for what other people thought when have your own actions been governed by it he moved another step without speaking and she caught him by the arm no you shant go not like that wait she turned and crossed the room on the lower shelf of the little table by her bed a few books were ranged she stooped and drew one hurriedly forth opening it at the flyleaf as she went back to amherst there read that the book was at lynbrook in your room and i came across it by chance the very day it was the little volume of bacon which she was thrusting at him he took it with a bewildered look as if scarcely following what she said read it read it she commanded and mechanically he read out the words he had

wrote it you wrote it i thought you meant it she cried as the book spun across a table and dropped to the floor he looked at her coldly almost apprehensively as if she had grown suddenly dangerous and remote then he turned and walked out of the room the striking of the clock roused her she rose to her feet rang the bell and told the maid through the door that she had a headache and was unable to see miss cicely then she turned back into the room and darkness closed on her she was not the kind to take grief passively it drove her in anguished pacings up and down the floor she walked and walked till her legs flagged under her then she dropped stupidly into the chair where amherst had sat all her world had crumbled about her it was as if some law of mental gravity had been mysteriously suspended and every firmlyanchored conviction every accepted process of reasoning spun disconnectedly through space amherst had not understood her worse still he had judged her as the world might judge her the core of her misery was there with terrible clearness she saw the suspicion that had crossed his mind the suspicion that she had kept silence in the beginning because she loved him and feared to lose him if she spoke and what if it were true what if her unconscious guilt went back even farther than his thought dared to track it she could not now recall a time when she had not loved him every chance meeting with him from their first brief talk at hanaford stood out embossed and glowing against the blur of lesser memories was it possible that she had loved him during bessys life that she had even subconsciously blindly been urged by her feeling for him to perform the act but she shook herself free from this morbid horror the rebound of health was always prompt in her and her mind instinctively rejected every form of moral poison no her motive had been normal sane and justifiable completely justifiable her fault lay in having dared to rise above conventional restrictions her mistake in believing that her husband could rise with her these reflections steadied her but they did not bring much comfort for her whole life was centred in amherst and she saw that he would never be able to free himself from the traditional view of her act in looking back and correcting her survey of his character in the revealing light of the last hours she perceived that like many men of emancipated thought he had remained subject to the old conventions of feeling and he had probably never given much thought to women till he met her had always been content to deal with them in the accepted currency of sentiment after all it was the currency they liked best and for which they offered their prettiest wares but what of the intellectual accord between himself and her she had not been deceived in that he and she had really been wedded in mind as well as in heart but until now there had not arisen in their lives one of those searching questions which call into play emotions rooted far below reason and judgment in the dark primal depths of inherited feeling it is easy to judge impersonal problems intellectually turning on them the full light of acquired knowledge but too often one must still grope ones way through the personal difficulty by the dim taper carried in longdead hands but was there then no hope of lifting ones individual life to a clearer height of conduct must one be content to think for the race and to feel only feel blindly and incoherently for ones self and was it not from such natures as amhersts natures in which independence of judgment was blent with strong human sympathy that the liberating impulse should come her mind grew weary of revolving in this vain circle of questions the fact was that in their particular case amherst had not risen above prejudice and emotion that though her act was one to which his intellectual sanction was given he had turned from her with instinctive repugnance had dishonoured her by the most wounding suspicions the tie between them was forever stained and debased justines long hospitaldiscipline made it impossible for her to lose consciousness of the lapse of time or to let her misery thicken into mental stupor she could not help thinking and moving and she presently lifted herself to her feet turned on the light and began to prepare for dinner it would be terrible to face her husband across mr langhopes pretty dinnertable and afterward in the charming drawingroom with its delicate old ornaments and intimate luxurious furniture but she could not continue to sit motionless in the dark it was her innermost instinct to pick herself up and go on while she dressed she listened anxiously for amhersts step in the next room but there was no sound and when she dragged herself downstairs the drawingroom was empty and the parlourmaid after a decent delay came to ask if dinner should be postponed she said no murmuring some vague pretext for her husbands absence and sitting alone through the succession of courses which composed the brief but carefullystudied menu when this ordeal was over she returned to the drawingroom and took up a book it chanced to be a new volume on labour problems which amherst must have brought back with him from westmore and it carried her thoughts instantly to the mills would this disaster poison their work there as well as their personal relation would he think of her as carrying contamination even into the task their love had illumined the hours went on without his returning and at length it occurred to her that he might have taken the night train to hanaford her heart contracted at the thought she remembered though every nerve shrank from the analogy his sudden flight at another crisis in his life and she felt obscurely that if he escaped from her now she would never recover her hold on him but could he be so cruel could he wish any one to suffer as she was suffering at ten oclock she could endure the drawingroom no longer and went up to her room again she undressed slowly trying to prolong the process as much as possible to put off the period of silence and inaction which would close in on her when she lay down on her bed but at length the dreaded moment came there was nothing more between her and the night she crept into bed and put out the light but as she slipped between the cold sheets a trembling seized her and after a moment she drew on her dressinggown again and groped her way to the lounge by the fire she pushed the lounge closer to the hearth and lay down still shivering though she had drawn the quilted coverlet up to her chin she lay there a long time with closed eyes in a mental darkness torn by sudden flashes of memory in one of these flashes a phrase of amhersts stood out a word spoken at westmore on the day of the opening of the emergency hospital about a goodlooking young man who had called to see her she remembered amhersts boyish burst of jealousy his sudden relief at the thought that the visitor might have been wyant and no doubt it was wyant wyant who had come to hanaford to threaten her and who baffled by her nonarrival or for some other unexplained reason had left again without carrying out his purpose it was dreadful to think by how slight a chance her first draught of happiness had escaped that drop of poison yet when she understood her inward cry was if it had happened my dearest need not have suffered already she was feeling amhersts pain more than her own understanding that it was harder to bear than hers because it was at war with all the reflective part of his nature as she lay there her face pressed into the cushions she heard a sound through the silent house the opening and closing of the outer door she turned cold and lay listening with strained ears yes now there was a step on the stairs her husbands step she heard him turn into his own room the throbs of her heart almost deafened her she only distinguished confusedly that he was moving about within so close that it was as if she felt his touch then her door opened and he entered he stumbled slightly in the darkness before he found the switch of the lamp and as he bent over it she saw that his face was flushed and that his eyes had an excited light which in any one less abstemious might almost have seemed like the effect of wine are you awake he asked she started up against the cushions her black hair streaming about her small ghostly face yes he walked over to the lounge and dropped into the low chair beside it ive given that cur a lesson he wont forget he exclaimed breathing hard the redness deepening in his face she turned on him in joy and trembling john oh john you didnt follow him oh what happened what have you done no i didnt follow him but there are some things that even the powers above cant stand and so they managed to let me run across him by the merest accident and i gave him something to remember he spoke in a strong clear voice that had a brightness like the brightness in his eyes she felt its heat in her veins the primitive woman in her glowed at contact with the primitive man but reflection chilled her the next moment but why why oh how could you where did it happen oh not in the street as she questioned him there rose before her the terrified vision of a crowd gathering the police newspapers a hideous publicity he must have been mad to do it and yet he must have done it because he loved her no no dont be afraid the powers looked after that too there was no one about and i dont think hell talk much about it she trembled fearing yet adoring him nothing could have been more unlike the amherst she fancied she knew than this act of irrational anger which had magically lifted the darkness from his spirit yet magically also it gave him back to her made them one flesh once more and suddenly the pressure of opposed emotions became too strong and she burst into tears she wept painfully violently with the resistance of strong natures unused to emotional expression till at length through the tumult of her tears she felt her husbands reassuring touch justine he said speaking once more in his natural voice she raised her face from her hands and they looked at each other justine this afternoon i said things i didnt mean to say her lips parted but her throat was still full of sobs and she could only look at him while the tears ran down i believe i understand now he continued in the same quiet tone her hand shrank from his clasp and she began to tremble again oh if you only believeif youre not suredont pretend to be he sat down beside her and drew her into his arms i am sure he whispered holding her close and pressing his lips against her face and hair oh my husband my husband youve come back to me he answered her with more kisses murmuring through them poor child poor child poor justine while he held her fast with her face against him she yielded to the childish luxury of murmuring out unjustified fears i was afraid you had gone back to hanaford tonight to hanaford to tell your mother she felt a contraction of the arm embracing her as though a throb of pain had stiffened it i shall never tell any one he said abruptly but as he felt in her a responsive shrinking he gathered her close again whispering through the hair that fell about her cheek dont talk dearlet us never talk of it again and in the clasp of his arms her terror and anguish subsided giving way not to the deep peace of tranquillized thought but to a confused wellbeing that lulled all thought to sleep xxxvii but thought could never be long silent between them and justines triumph lasted but a day with its end she saw what it had been made of the ascendency of youth and sex over his subjugated judgment her first impulse was to try and maintain it why not use the protective arts with which love inspired her she who lived so keenly in the brain could live as intensely in her feelings her quick imagination tutored her looks and words taught her the spells to weave about shorn giants and for a few days she and amherst lost themselves in this selfevoked cloud of passion both clinging fast to the visible the palpable in their relation as if conscious already that its finer essence had fled amherst made no allusion to what had passed asked for no details offered no reassurances behaved as if the whole episode had been effaced from his mind and from wyant there came no sound he seemed to have disappeared from life as he had from their talk toward the end of the week amherst announced that he must return to hanaford and justine at once declared her intention of going with him he seemed surprised disconcerted almost and for the first time the shadow of what had happened fell visibly between them but ought you to leave cicely before mr langhope comes back he suggested he will be here in two days but he will expect to find you it is almost the first of april we are to have cicely with us for the summer there is no reason why i should not go back to my work at westmore there was in fact no reason that he could produce and the next day they returned to hanaford together with her perceptions strung to the last pitch of sensitiveness she felt a change in amherst as soon as they reentered bessys house he was still scrupulously considerate almost too scrupulously tender but with a tinge of lassitude like a man who tries to keep up under the stupefying approach of illness and she began to hate the power by which she held him it was not thus they had once walked together free in mind though so linked in habit and feeling when their love was not a deadening drug but a vivifying element that cleared thought instead of stifling it there were moments when she felt that open alienation would be easier because it would be nearer the truth and at such moments she longed to speak to beg him to utter his mind to go with her once for all into the depths of the subject they continued to avoid but at the last her heart always failed her she could not face the thought of losing him of hearing him speak estranging words to her they had been at hanaford for about ten days when one morning at breakfast amherst uttered a sudden exclamation over a letter he was reading what is it she asked in a tremor he had grown very pale and was pushing the hair from his forehead with the gesture habitual to him in moments of painful indecision what is it justine repeated her fear growing nothing he began thrusting the letter under the pile of envelopes by his plate but she continued to look at him anxiously till she drew his eyes to hers mr langhope writes that theyve appointed wyant to saint christophers he said abruptly oh the letter we forgot the letter she cried yes we forgot the letter but how dare he amherst said nothing but the long silence between them seemed full of ironic answers till she brought out hardly above her breath what shall you do write at once tell mr langhope hes not fit for the place of course she murmured he went on tearing open his other letters and glancing at their contents she leaned back in her chair her cup of coffee untasted listening to the recurrent crackle of torn paper as he tossed aside one letter after another presently he rose from his seat and as she followed him from the diningroom she noticed that his breakfast had also remained untasted he gathered up his letters and walked toward the smokingroom and after a moments hesitation she joined him john she said from the threshold he was just seating himself at his desk but he turned to her with an obvious effort at kindness which made the set look of his face the more marked she closed the door and went up to him if you write that to mr langhope dr wyant will will tell him she said yes we must be prepared for that she was silent and amherst flung himself down on the leather ottoman against the wall she stood before him clasping and unclasping her hands in speechless distress what would you have me do he asked at length almost irritably i only thoughthe told me he would keep straightif he only had a chance she faltered out amherst lifted his head slowly and looked at her you mean i am to do nothing is that it she moved nearer to him with beseeching eyes i cant bear it i cant bear that others should come between us she broke out passionately he made no answer but she could see a look of suffering cross his face and coming still closer she sank down on the ottoman laying her hand on his johnoh john spare me she whispered for a moment his hand lay quiet under hers then he drew it out and enclosed her trembling fingers very well ill give him a chance ill do nothing he said suddenly putting his other arm about her the reaction caught her by the throat forcing out a dry sob or two and as she pressed her face against him he raised it up and gently kissed her but even as their lips met she felt that they were sealing a treaty with dishonour that his kiss should come to mean that to her it was unbearable worse than any personal pain the thought of dragging him down to falsehood through her weakness she drew back and rose to her feet putting aside his detaining hand no no what am i saying it cant be you must tell the truth her voice gathered strength as she spoke oh forget what i said i didnt mean it but again he seemed sunk in inaction like a man over whom some baneful lethargy is stealing john john forget she repeated urgently he looked up at her you realize what it will mean yes i realize but it must be and it will make no difference between uswill it no no why should it he answered apathetically then write tell mr langhope not to give him the place i want it over he rose slowly to his feet without looking at her again and walked over to the desk she sank down on the ottoman and watched him with burning eyes while he drew forth a sheet of notepaper and began to write but after he had written a few words he laid down his pen and swung his chair about so that he faced her i cant do it in this way he exclaimed how then what do you mean she said starting up he looked at her do you want the story to come from wyant oh she looked back at him with sudden insight you mean to tell mr langhope yourself yes i mean to take the next train to town and tell him her trembling increased so much that she had to rest her hands against the edge of the ottoman to steady herself but ifif after allwyant should not speak well if he shouldnt could you bear to owe our safety to him safety it comes to that doesnt it if were afraid to speak she sat silent letting the bitter truth of this sink into her till it poured courage into her veins yes it comes to that she confessed then you feel as i do that you must go that this is intolerable the words struck down her last illusion and she rose and went over to the writingtable yes go she said he stood up also and took both her hands not in a caress but gravely almost severely listen justine you must understand exactly what this means may mean i am willing to go on as we are nowas long as we canbecause i love youbecause i would do anything to spare you pain but if i speak i must say everything i must follow this thing up to its uttermost consequences thats what i want to make clear to you her heart sank with a foreboding of new peril what consequences cant you see for yourself when you look about this house this house he dropped her hands and took an abrupt turn across the room i owe everything to her he broke out all i am all i have all i have been able to give you and i must go and tell her father that you stop stop she cried lifting her hands as if to keep off a blow no dont make me stop we must face it he said doggedly but this this isnt the truth you put it as if almost as if yes dont finish has it occurred to you that he may think that amherst asked with a terrible laugh but at that she recovered her courage as she always did when an extreme call was made on it no i dont believe it if he does it will be because you think it yourself her voice sank and she lifted her hands and pressed them to her temples and if you think it nothing mattersone way or the other she paused and her voice regained its strength that is what i must face before you go what you think what you believe of me youve never told me that amherst at the challenge remained silent while a slow red crept to his cheekbones havent i told you by by what ive done he said slowly no what youve done has covered up what you thought and ive helped you cover it im to blame too but it was not for this that wethat we had that halfyear togethernot to sink into connivance and evasion i dont want another hour of sham happiness i want the truth from you whatever it is he stood motionless staring moodily at the floor dont you see thats my misery that i dont know myself you dont knowwhat you think of me good god justine why do you try to strip life naked i dont know whats been going on in me these last weeks you must know what you think of my motivefor doing what i did she saw in his face how he shrank from the least allusion to the act about which their torment revolved but he forced himself to raise his head and look at her i have never for one moment questioned your motive or failed to see that it was justifiedunder the circumstances oh john john she broke out in the wild joy of hearing herself absolved but the next instant her subtle perceptions felt the unconscious reserve behind his admission your mind justifies me not your heart isnt that your misery she said he looked at her almost piteously as if in the last resort it was from her that light must come to him on my soul i dont knowi cant tellits all dark in me i know you did what you thought bestif i had been there i believe i should have asked you to do itbut i wish to god she interrupted him sobbingly oh i ought never to have let you love me i ought to have seen that i was cut off from you forever i have brought you wretchedness when i would have given my life for you i dont deserve that you should forgive me for that her sudden outbreak seemed to restore his selfpossession he went up to her and took her hand with a quieting touch there is no question of forgiveness justine dont let us torture each other with vain repinings our business is to face the thing and we shall be better for having talked it out i shall be better for my part for having told mr langhope but before i go i want to be sure that you understand the view he may takeand the effect it will probably have on our future our future she started no i dont understand amherst paused a moment as if trying to choose the words least likely to pain her mr langhope knows that my marriage wasunhappy through my fault he no doubt thinks and if he chooses to infer thatthat you and i may have cared for each otherbeforeand that it was because there was a chance of recovery that you oh we must face it he repeated inflexibly and you must understand that if there is the faintest hint of this kind i shall give up everything here as soon as it can be settled legally god how tredegar will like the job and you and i will have to go and begin life over againsomewhere else for an instant a mad hope swelled in her the vision of escaping with him into new scenes a new life away from the coil of memories that bound them down as in a net but the reaction of reason came at once she saw him cut off from his chosen work his career destroyed his honour clouded above all ah this was what wrung them both his task undone his people flung back into the depths from which he had lifted them and all through her doing all because she had clutched at happiness with too rash a hand the thought stung her to passionate activity of mind made her resolve to risk anything dare anything before she involved him farther in her own ruin she felt her brain clear gradually and the thickness dissolve in her throat i understand she said in a low voice raising her eyes to his and youre ready to accept the consequences think again before its too late she paused that is what i should likewhat i wanted to ask youthe time to think she saw a slight shade cross his face as if he had not expected this failure of courage in her but he said quietly you dont want me to go today not today give me one more day very well she laid a timid hand on his arm please go out to westmore as usual as if nothing had happened and tonightwhen you come backi shall have decided very well he repeated youll be gone all day he glanced at his watch yes i had meant to be unless no i would rather be alone goodbye she said letting her hand slip softly along his coatsleeve as he turned to the door xxxviii at halfpast six that afternoon just as amherst on his return from the mills put the key into his door at hanaford mrs ansell in new york was being shown into mr langhopes library as she entered her friend rose from his chair by the fire and turned on her a face so disordered by emotion that she stopped short with an exclamation of alarm henry what has happened why did you send for me because i couldnt go to you i couldnt trust myself in the streets in the light of day but why what is it not cicely he struck both hands upward with a comprehensive gesture cicely everyone the whole world his clenched fist came down on the table against which he was leaning maria my girl might have been saved mrs ansell looked at him with growing perturbation saved bessys life but how by whom she might have been allowed to live i mean to recover she was killed maria that woman killed her mrs ansell with another cry of bewilderment let herself drop helplessly into the nearest chair in heavens name henry what woman he seated himself opposite to her clutching at his stick and leaning his weight heavily on it a white dishevelled old man i wonder why you ask just to spare me their eyes met in a piercing exchange of question and answer and mrs ansell tried to bring out reasonably i ask in order to understand what you are saying well then if you insist on keeping up appearances my daughterinlaw killed my daughter there you have it he laughed silently with a tear on his reddened eyelids mrs ansell groaned henry you are raving i understand less and less i dont see how i can speak more plainly she told me so herself in this room not an hour ago she told you who told you john amhersts wife told me shed killed my child its as easy as breathing if you know how to use a morphianeedle light seemed at last to break on his hearer oh my poor henry you mean she gave too much there was some dreadful accident there was no accident she killed my child killed her deliberately dont look at me as if i were a madman she sat in that chair youre in when she told me justine has she been here today mrs ansell paused in a painful effort to readjust her thoughts but why did she tell you thats simple enough to prevent wyants doing it oh broke from his hearer in a long sigh of fear and intelligence mr langhope looked at her with a smile of miserable exultation you knew you suspected all along but now you must speak out he exclaimed with a sudden note of command she sat motionless as if trying to collect herself i know nothing i only meant why was this never known before he was upon her at once you think because they understood each other and now theres been a break between them he wanted too big a share of the spoils oh its all so abysmally vile he covered his face with a shaking hand and mrs ansell remained silent plunged in a speechless misery of conjecture at length she regained some measure of her habitual composure and leaning forward with her eyes on his face said in a quiet tone if i am to help you you must try to tell me just what has happened he made an impatient gesture havent i told you she found that her accomplice meant to speak and rushed to town to forestall him mrs ansell reflected but why with his place at saint christophers secured did dr wyant choose this time to threaten her if as you imagine hes an accomplice because hes a drugtaker and she didnt wish him to have the place she didnt wish it but that does not look as if she were afraid she had only to hold her tongue mr langhope laughed sardonically its not quite so simple amherst was coming to town to tell me ah he knows yes and she preferred that i should have her version first and what is her version the furrows of misery deepened in mr langhopes face maria dont ask too much of me i cant go over it again she says she wanted to spare my child she says the doctors were keeping her alive torturing her uselessly as aa sort of scientific experiment she forced on me the hideous details mrs ansell waited a moment well may it not be true wyants version is different he says bessy would have recovered he says garford thought so too and what does she answer she denies it no she admits that garford was in doubt but she says the chance was too remote the pain too badthats her cue naturally mrs ansell leaning back in her chair with hands meditatively stretched along its arms gave herself up to silent consideration of the fragmentary statements cast before her the long habit of ministering to her friends in moments of perplexity and distress had given her an almost judicial keenness in disentangling and coordinating facts incoherently presented and in seizing on the thread of motive that connected them but she had never before been confronted with a situation so poignant in itself and bearing so intimately on her personal feelings and she needed time to free her thoughts from the impending rush of emotion at last she raised her head and said why did mr amherst let her come to you instead of coming himself he knows nothing of her being here she persuaded him to wait a day and as soon as he had gone to the mills this morning she took the first train to town ah mrs ansell murmured thoughtfully and mr langhope rejoined with a conclusive gesture do you want more proofs of panicstricken guilt oh guilt his friend revolved her large soft muff about a drooping hand theres so much still to understand your mind does not as a rule work so slowly he said with some asperity but she paid no heed to his tone amherst for instance how long has he known of this she continued a week or two only she made that clear and what is his attitude ah that i conjecture is just what she means to keep us from knowing you mean shes afraid mr langhope gathered his haggard brows in a frown shes afraid of course mortally i never saw a woman more afraid i only wonder she had the courage to face me ah thats it why did she face you to extenuate her act to give you her version because she feared his might be worse do you gather that that was her motive it was mr langhopes turn to hesitate he furrowed the thick turkey rug with the point of his ebony stick pausing once or twice to revolve it gimletlike in a gap of the pile not her avowed motive naturally well at least then let me have that her avowed motive oh shed prepared one of course trust her to have a dozen ready the one she produced was simply the desire to protect her husband her husband does he too need protection my god if he takes her side at any rate her fear seemed to be that what she had done might ruin him might cause him to feel as well he may that the mere fact of being her husband makes his situation as cicelys stepfather as my soninlaw intolerable and she came to clear him as it were to find out in short on what terms i should be willing to continue my present relations with him as though this hideous thing had not been known to me mrs ansell raised her head quickly well and what were your terms he hesitated she spared me the pain of proposing any i had only to accept hers hers that she should disappear altogether from my sight and from the childs naturally good heaven i should like to include amherst in that but im tied hand and foot as you see by cicelys interests and im bound to say she exonerated him completely completely mrs ansell was again silent but a swift flight of thoughts traversed her drooping face but if you are to remain on the old terms with her husband how is she to disappear out of your life without also disappearing out of his mr langhope gave a slight laugh i leave her to work out that problem and you think amherst will consent to such conditions hes not to know of them the unexpectedness of the reply reduced mrs ansell to a sound of inarticulate interrogation and mr langhope continued not at first that is she had thought it all out foreseen everything and she wrung from me i dont yet know how a promise that when i saw him i would make it appear that i cleared him completely not only of any possible complicity or whatever you choose to call it but of any sort of connection with the matter in my thoughts of him i am in short to let him feel that he and i are to continue on the old footing and i agreed on the condition of her effacing herself somehow of course on some other pretext some other pretext but what conceivable pretext my poor friend he adores her mr langhope raised his eyebrows slightly we havent seen him since this became known to him she has and she let slip that he was horrorstruck mrs ansell looked up with a quick exclamation let slip isnt it much more likely that she forced it on you emphasized it to the last limit of credulity she sank her hands to the arms of the chair and exclaimed looking him straight in the eyes you say she was frightened it strikes me she was dauntless mr langhope stared a moment then he said with an ironic shrug no doubt then she counted on its striking me too mrs ansell breathed a shuddering sigh oh i understand your feeling as you do im deep in the horror of it myself but i cant help seeing that this woman might have saved herself and that shes chosen to save her husband instead what i dont see from what i know of him she musingly proceeded is how on any imaginable pretext she will induce him to accept the sacrifice mr langhope made a resentful movement if thats the only point your mind dwells on mrs ansell looked up it doesnt dwell anywhere as yet except my poor henry she murmured rising to move toward him and softly laying her hand on his bent shoulder except on your distress and misery on the very part i cant yet talk of cant question you about he let her hand rest there a moment then he turned and drawing it into his own tremulous fingers pressed it silently with a clinging helpless grasp that drew the tears to her eyes justine brent in her earliest girlhood had gone through one of those emotional experiences that are the infantile diseases of the heart she had fancied herself beloved of a youth of her own age had secretly returned his devotion and had seen it reft from her by another such an incident as inevitable as the measles sometimes like that mild malady leaves traces out of all proportion to its actual virulence the blow fell on justine with tragic suddenness and she reeled under it thinking darkly of death and renouncing all hopes of future happiness her ready pen often beguiled her into recording her impressions and she now found an escape from despair in writing the history of a damsel similarly wronged in her tale the heroine killed herself but the author saved by this vicarious sacrifice lived and in time even smiled over her manuscript it was many years since justine amherst had recalled this youthful incident but the memory of it recurred to her as she turned from mr langhopes door for a moment death seemed the easiest escape from what confronted her but though she could no longer medicine her despair by turning it into fiction she knew at once that she must somehow transpose it into terms of action that she must always escape from life into more life and not into its negation she had been carried into mr langhopes presence by that expiatory passion which still burns so high and draws its sustenance from so deep down in the unsleeping hearts of women though she had never wavered in her conviction that her act had been justified her ideas staggered under the sudden comprehension of its consequences not till that morning had she seen those consequences in their terrible unsuspected extent had she understood how one stone rashly loosened from the laboriously erected structure of human society may produce remote fissures in that clumsy fabric she saw that having hazarded the loosening of the stone she should have held herself apart from ordinary human ties like some priestess set apart for the service of the temple and instead she had seized happiness with both hands taken it as the gift of the very fate she had herself precipitated she remembered some old greek saying to the effect that the gods never forgive the mortal who presumes to love and suffer like a god she had dared to do both and the gods were bringing ruin on that deeper self which had its life in those about her so much had become clear to her when she heard amherst declare his intention of laying the facts before mr langhope his few broken words lit up the farthest verge of their lives she saw that his retrospective reverence for his wifes memory which was far as possible removed from the strong passion of the mind and senses that bound him to herself was indelibly stained and desecrated by the discovery that all he had received from the one woman had been won for him by the deliberate act of the other this was what no reasoning no appeal to the calmer judgment could ever in his inmost thoughts undo or extenuate it could find appeasement only in the renunciation of all that had come to him from bessy and this renunciation so different from the mere sacrifice of material wellbeing was bound up with consequences so farreaching so destructive to the cause which had inspired his whole life that justine felt the helpless terror of the mortal who has launched one of the heavenly bolts she could think of no way of diverting it but the way she had chosen she must see mr langhope first must clear amherst of the least faint association with her act or her intention and to do this she must exaggerate not her own compunction for she could not depart from the exact truth in reporting her feelings and convictions but her husbands first instinctive movement of horror the revulsion of feeling her confession had really produced in him this was the most painful part of her task and for this reason her excited imagination clothed it with a special expiatory value if she could purchase amhersts peace of mind and the security of his future by confessing and even overemphasizing the momentary estrangement between them there would be a bitter joy in such payment her hour with mr langhope proved the correctness of her intuition she could save amherst only by effacing herself from his life those about him would be only too ready to let her bear the full burden of obloquy she could see that for a dozen reasons mr langhope even in the first shock of his dismay unconsciously craved a way of exonerating amherst of preserving intact the relation on which so much of his comfort had come to depend and she had the courage to make the most of his desire to fortify it by isolating amhersts point of view from hers so that when the hour was over she had the solace of feeling that she had completely freed him from any conceivable consequence of her act so far the impetus of selfsacrifice had carried her straight to her goal but as frequently happens with such atoning impulses it left her stranded just short of any subsequent plan of conduct her next step indeed was clear enough she must return to hanaford explain to her husband that she had felt impelled to tell her own story to mr langhope and then take up her ordinary life till chance offered her a pretext for fulfilling her promise but what pretext was likely to present itself no symbolic horn would sound the hour of fulfillment she must be her own judge and hear the call in the depths of her own conscience xxxix when amherst returning late that afternoon from westmore learned of his wifes departure and read the note she had left he found it for a time impossible to bring order out of the confusion of feeling produced in him his mind had been disturbed enough before all day through the routine of work at the mills he had laboured inwardly with the difficulties confronting him and his unrest had been increased by the fact that his situation bore an ironic likeness to that in which from a far different cause he had found himself at the other crisis of his life once more he was threatened with the possibility of having to give up westmore at a moment when concentration of purpose and persistency of will were at last beginning to declare themselves in tangible results before he had only given up dreams now it was their fruition that he was asked to surrender and he was fixed in his resolve to withdraw absolutely from westmore if the statement he had to make to mr langhope was received with the least hint of an offensive mental reservation all forms of moral compromise had always been difficult to amherst and like many men absorbed in large and complicated questions he craved above all clearness and peace in his household relation the first months of his second marriage had brought him as a part of richer and deeper joys this enveloping sense of a clear moral medium in which no subterfuge or equivocation could draw breath he had felt that henceforth he could pour into his work all the combative energy the powers of endurance resistance renovation which had once been unprofitably dissipated in the vain attempt to bring some sort of harmony into life with bessy between himself and justine apart from their love for each other there was the wider passion for their kind which gave back to them an enlarged and deepened reflection of their personal feeling in such an air it had seemed that no petty egotism could hamper their growth no misintelligence obscure their love yet all the while this pure happiness had been unfolding against a sordid background of falsehood and intrigue from which his soul turned with loathing justine was right in assuming that amherst had never thought much about women he had vaguely regarded them as meant to people that hazy domain of feeling designed to offer the busy man an escape from thought his second marriage leading him to the blissful discovery that woman can think as well as feel that there are beings of the ornamental sex in whom brain and heart have so enlarged each other that their emotions are as clear as thought their thoughts as warm as emotions this discovery had had the effect of making him discard his former summary conception of woman as a bundle of inconsequent impulses and admit her at a stroke to full mental equality with her lord the result of this act of manumission was that in judging justine he could no longer allow for what was purely feminine in her conduct it was incomprehensible to him that she to whom truth had seemed the essential element of life should have been able to draw breath and find happiness in an atmosphere of falsehood and dissimulation his mind could assent at least in the abstract to the reasonableness of her act but he was still unable to understand her having concealed it from him he could enter far enough into her feelings to allow for her having kept silence on his first return to lynbrook when she was still under the strain of a prolonged and terrible trial but that she should have continued to do so when he and she had discovered and confessed their love for each other threw an intolerable doubt on her whole course he stayed late at the mills finding one pretext after another for delaying his return to hanaford and trying while he gave one part of his mind to the methodical performance of his task to adjust the other to some definite view of the future but all was darkened and confused by the sense that between himself and justine complete communion of thought was no longer possible it had in fact never existed there had always been a locked chamber in her mind and he knew not yet what other secrets might inhabit it the shock of finding her gone when he reached home gave a new turn to his feelings she had made no mystery of her destination leaving word with the servants that she had gone to town to see mr langhope and amherst found a note from her on his study table i feel she wrote that i ought to see mr langhope myself and be the first to tell him what must be told it was like you dearest to wish to spare me this but it would have made me more unhappy and mr langhope might wish to hear the facts in my own words i shall come back tomorrow and after that it will be for you to decide what must be done the brevity and simplicity of the note were characteristic in moments of high tension justine was always calm and direct and it was like her too not to make any covert appeal to his sympathy not to seek to entrap his judgment by caressing words and plaintive allusions the quiet tone in which she stated her purpose matched the firmness and courage of the act and for a moment amherst was shaken by a revulsion of feeling her heart was level with his after all if she had done wrong she would bear the brunt of it alone it was so exactly what he himself would have felt and done in such a situation that faith in her flowed back through all the dried channels of his heart but an instant later the current set the other way the wretched years of his first marriage had left in him a residue of distrust a tendency to dissociate every act from its ostensible motive he had been too profoundly the dupe of his own enthusiasm not to retain this streak of scepticism and it now moved him to ask if justines sudden departure had not been prompted by some other cause than the one she avowed had that alone actuated her why not have told it to him and asked his consent to her plan why let him leave the house without a hint of her purpose and slip off by the first train as soon as he was safe at westmore might it not be that she had special reasons for wishing mr langhope to hear her own version first that there were questions she wished to parry herself explanations she could trust no one to make for her the thought plunged amherst into deeper misery he knew not how to defend himself against these disintegrating suspicions he felt only that once the accord between two minds is broken it is less easy to restore than the passion between two hearts he dragged heavily through his solitary evening and awaited with dread and yet impatience a message announcing his wifes return it would have been easier far easier when she left mr langhopes door to go straight out into the darkness and let it close in on her for good justine felt herself yielding to the spell of that suggestion as she walked along the lamplit pavement hardly conscious of the turn her steps were taking the door of the house which a few weeks before had been virtually hers had closed on her without a question she had been suffered to go out into the darkness without being asked whither she was going or under what roof her night would be spent the contrast between her past and present sounded through the tumult of her thoughts like the evil laughter of temptation the house at hanaford to which she was returning would look at her with the same alien face nowhere on earth at that moment was a door which would open to her like the door of home in her painful selfabsorption she followed the side street toward madison avenue and struck southward down that tranquil thoroughfare there was a physical relief in rapid motion and she walked on still hardly aware of her direction toward the clustered lights of madison square should she return to hanaford she had still several hours to dispose of before the departure of the midnight train and if she did not return hours and dates no longer existed for her it would be easier infinitely easier not to go back to take up her life with amherst would under any circumstances be painful enough to take it up under the tacit restriction of her pledge to mr langhope seemed more than human courage could face as she approached the square she had almost reached the conclusion that such a temporary renewal was beyond her strength beyond what any standard of duty exacted the question of an alternative hardly troubled her she would simply go on living and find an escape in work and material hardship it would not be hard for so inconspicuous a person to slip back into the obscure mass of humanity she paused a moment on the edge of the square vaguely seeking a direction for her feet that might permit the working of her thoughts to go on uninterrupted and as she stood there her eyes fell on the bench near the corner of twentysixth street where she had sat with amherst on the day of his flight from lynbrook he too had dreamed of escaping from insoluble problems into the clear air of hard work and simple duties and she remembered the words with which she had turned him back the cases of course were not identical since he had been flying in anger and wounded pride from a situation for which he was in no wise to blame yet if even at such a moment she had insisted on charity and forbearance how could she now show less selfdenial than she had exacted of him if you go away for a time surely it ought to be in such a way that your going does not seem to cast any reflection on bessy that was how she had put it to him and how with the mere change of a name she must now for reasons as cogent put it to herself it was just as much a part of the course she had planned to return to her husband now and take up their daily life together as it would later on be her duty to drop out of that life when her doing so could no longer involve him in the penalty to be paid she stood a little while looking at the bench on which they had sat and giving thanks in her heart for the past strength which was now helping to build up her failing courage such a patchwork business are our best endeavours yet so faithfully does each weak upward impulse reach back a hand to the next justines explanation of her visit to mr langhope was not wholly satisfying to her husband she did not conceal from him that the scene had been painful but she gave him to understand as briefly as possible that mr langhope after his first movement of uncontrollable distress had seemed able to make allowances for the pressure under which she had acted and that he had at any rate given no sign of intending to let her confession make any change in the relation between the households if she did not as amherst afterward recalled put all this specifically into words she contrived to convey it in her manner in her allusions above all in her recovered composure she had the demeanour of one who has gone through a severe test of strength but come out of it in complete control of the situation there was something slightly unnatural in this prompt solution of so complicated a difficulty and it had the effect of making amherst ask himself what to produce such a result must have been the gist of her communication to mr langhope if the latter had shown any disposition to be cruel or even unjust amhersts sympathies would have rushed instantly to his wifes defence but the fact that there was apparently to be no call on them left his reason free to compare and discriminate with the final result that the more he pondered on his fatherinlaws attitude the less intelligible it became a few days after justines return he was called to new york on business and before leaving he told her that he should of course take the opportunity of having a talk with mr langhope she received the statement with the gentle composure from which she had not departed since her return from town and he added tentatively as if to provoke her to a clearer expression of feeling i shall not be satisfied of course till i see for myself just how he feels just how much at bottom this has affected him since my own future relation to him will as i have already told you depend entirely on his treatment of you she met this without any sign of disturbance his treatment of me was very kind she said but would it not on your part she continued hesitatingly be kinder not to touch on the subject so soon again the line deepened between his brows touch on it i shant rest till ive gone to the bottom of it till then you must understand he summed up with decision i feel myself only on sufferance here at westmore yes i understand she assented and as he bent over to kiss her for goodbye a tenuous impenetrable barrier seemed to lie between their lips it was justines turn to await with a passionate anxiety her husbands homecoming and when on the third day he reappeared her dearly acquired selfcontrol gave way to a tremulous eagerness this was after all the turningpoint in their lives everything depended on how mr langhope had played up to his cue had kept to his side of their bond amhersts face showed signs of emotional havoc when feeling once broke out in him it had full play and she could see that his hour with mr langhope had struck to the roots of life but the resultant expression was one of invigoration not defeat and she gathered at a glance that her partner had not betrayed her she drew a tragic solace from the success of her achievement yet it flung her into her husbands arms with a passion of longing to which as she instantly felt he did not as completely respond there was still then something between them somewhere the mechanism of her scheme had failed or its action had not produced the result she had counted on as soon as they were alone in the study she said as quietly as she could you saw your fatherinlaw you talked with him yes i spent the afternoon with him cicely sent you her love she coloured at the mention of the childs name and murmured and mr langhope he is perfectly calm now perfectly impartial this business has made me feel amherst added abruptly that i have never been quite fair to him i never thought him a magnanimous man he has proved himself so justine murmured her head bent low over a bit of needlework and amherst affirmed energetically he has been more than that generous she looked up at him with a smile i am so glad dear so glad there is not to be the least shadow between you no amherst said his voice flagging slightly there was a pause and then he went on with renewed emphasis of course i made my point clear to him your point that i stand or fall by his judgment of you oh if he had but said it more tenderly but he delivered it with the quiet resolution of a man who contends for an abstract principle of justice and not for a passion grown into the fibres of his heart you are generous too she faltered her voice trembling a little amherst frowned and she perceived that any hint on her part of recognizing the slightest change in their relations was still like pressure on a painful bruise there is no need for such words between us he said impatiently and mr langhopes attitude he added with an effort at a lighter tone has made it unnecessary thank heaven that we should ever revert to the subject again he turned to his desk as he spoke and plunged into perusal of the letters that had accumulated in his absence there was a temporary excess of work at westmore and during the days that followed he threw himself into it with a zeal that showed justine how eagerly he sought any pretext for avoiding confidential moments the perception was painful enough yet not as painful as another discovery that awaited her she too had her tasks at westmore the supervision of the hospital the day nursery the mothers club and the various other organizations whereby she and amherst were trying to put some sort of social unity into the lives of the millhands and when on the day after his return from new york she presented herself as usual at the westmore office where she was in the habit of holding a brief consultation with him before starting on her rounds she was at once aware of a new tinge of constraint in his manner it hurt him then to see her at westmore hurt him more than to live with her at hanaford under bessys roof for it was there at the mills that his real life was led the life with which justine had been most identified the life that had been made possible for both by the magnanimity of that other woman whose presence was now forever between them justine made no sign she resumed her work as though unconscious of any change but whereas in the past they had always found pretexts for seeking each other out to discuss the order of the days work or merely to warm their hearts by a rapid word or two now each went a separate way sometimes not meeting till they regained the house at nightfall and as the weeks passed she began to understand that by a strange inversion of probability the relation between amherst and herself was to be the means of holding her to her compact with mr langhope if indeed it were not nearer the truth to say that it had made such a compact unnecessary amherst had done his best to take up their life together as though there had been no break in it but slowly the fact was being forced on her that by remaining with him she was subjecting him to intolerable suffering was coming to be the personification of the very thoughts and associations from which he struggled to escape happily her promptness of action had preserved westmore to him and in westmore she believed that he would in time find a refuge from even the memory of what he was now enduring but meanwhile her presence kept the thought alive and had every other incentive lost its power this would have been enough to sustain her fate had ironically enough furnished her with an unanswerable reason for leaving amherst the impossibility of their keeping up such a relation as now existed between them would soon become too patent to be denied meanwhile as summer approached she knew that external conditions would also call upon her to act the visible signal for her withdrawal would be cicelys next visit to westmore the childs birthday fell in early june and amherst some months previously had asked that she should be permitted to spend it at hanaford and that it should be chosen as the date for the opening of the first model cottages at hopewood it was justine who had originated the idea of associating cicelys anniversaries with some significant moment in the annals of the mill colony and struck by the happy suggestion he had at once applied himself to hastening on the work at hopewood the eagerness of both amherst and justine that cicely should be identified with the developing life of westmore had been one of the chief influences in reconciling mr langhope to his soninlaws second marriage husband and wife had always made it clear that they regarded themselves as the mere trustees of the westmore revenues and that cicelys name should as early as possible be associated with every measure taken for the welfare of the people but now as justine knew the situation was changed and cicely would not be allowed to come to hanaford until she herself had left it the manifold threads of divination that she was perpetually throwing out in amhersts presence told her without word or sign on his part that he also awaited cicelys birthday as a determining date in their lives he spoke confidently and as a matter of course of mr langhopes bringing his granddaughter at the promised time but justine could hear a note of challenge in his voice as though he felt that mr langhopes sincerity had not yet been put to the test as the time drew nearer it became more difficult for her to decide just how she should take the step she had determined on she had no material anxiety for the future for although she did not mean to accept a penny from her husband after she had left him she knew it would be easy for her to take up her nursing again and she knew also that her hospital connections would enable her to find work in a part of the country far enough distant to remove her entirely from his life but she had not yet been able to invent a reason for leaving that should be convincing enough to satisfy him without directing his suspicions to the truth as she revolved the question she suddenly recalled an exclamation of amhersts a word spoken as they entered mr langhopes door on the fatal afternoon when she had found wyants letter awaiting her theres nothing you cant make people believe you little jesuit she had laughed in pure joy at his praise of her for every bantering phrase had then been a caress but now the words returned with a sinister meaning she knew they were true as far as amherst was concerned in the arts of casuistry and equivocation a child could have outmatched him and she had only to exert her will to dupe him as deeply as she pleased well the task was odious but it was needful it was the bitterest part of her expiation that she must deceive him once more to save him from the results of her former deception this decision once reached every nerve in her became alert for an opportunity to do the thing and have it over so that whenever they were alone together she was in an attitude of perpetual tension her whole mind drawn up for its final spring the decisive word came one evening toward the end of may in the form of an allusion on amhersts part to cicelys approaching visit husband and wife were seated in the drawingroom after dinner he with a book in hand she bending as usual over the needlework which served at once as a pretext for lowered eyes and as a means of disguising her fixed preoccupation have you worked out a plan he asked laying down his book it occurred to me that it would be rather a good idea if we began with a sort of festivity for the kids at the day nursery you could take cicely there early and i could bring out mr langhope after luncheon the whole performance would probably tire him too much justine listened with suspended thread yes that seems a good plan will you see about the details then you know its only a week off yes i know she hesitated and then took the spring i ought to tell you john that i i think i may not be here he raised his head abruptly and she saw the blood mount under his fair skin not be here he exclaimed she met his look as steadily as she could i think of going away for awhile going away where what is the matter are you not well there was her pretext he had found it for her why should she not simply plead illhealth afterward she would find a way of elaborating the details and making them plausible but suddenly as she was about to speak there came to her the feeling which up to one fatal moment in their lives had always ruled their intercourse the feeling that there must be truth and absolute truth between them absolute indeed it could never be again since he must never know of the condition exacted by mr langhope but that at the moment seemed almost a secondary motive compared to the deeper influences that were inexorably forcing them apart at any rate she would trump up no trivial excuse for the step she had resolved on there should be truth if not the whole truth in this last decisive hour between them yes i am quite well at least my body is she said quietly but i am tired perhaps my mind has been going round too long in the same circle she paused for a brief space and then raising her head and looking him straight in the eyes has it not been so with you she asked the question seemed to startle amherst he rose from his chair and took a few steps toward the hearth where a small fire was crumbling into embers he turned his back to it resting an arm on the mantelshelf then he said in a somewhat unsteady tone i thought we had agreed not to speak of all that again justine shook her head with a fugitive halfsmile i made no such agreement and besides what is the use when we can always hear each others thoughts speak and they speak of nothing else amhersts brows darkened it is not so with mine he began but she raised her hand with a silencing gesture i know you have tried your best that it should not be so and perhaps you have succeeded better than i but i am tired horribly tired i want to get away from everything she saw a look of pain in his eyes he continued to lean against the mantelshelf his head slightly lowered his unseeing gaze fixed on a remote scroll in the pattern of the carpet then he said in a low tone i can only repeat again what i have said before that i understand why you did what you did thank you she answered in the same tone there was another pause for she could not trust herself to go on speaking and presently he asked with a tinge of bitterness in his voice that does not satisfy you she hesitated it satisfies me as much as it does you and no more she replied at length he looked up hastily what do you mean just what i say we can neither of us go on living on that understanding just at present she rose as she spoke and crossed over to the hearth i want to go back to my nursing to go out to michigan to a town where i spent a few months the year before i first came to hanaford i have friends there and can get work easily and you can tell people that i was ill and needed a change it had been easier to say than she had imagined and her voice held its clear note till the end but when she had ceased the whole room began to reverberate with her words and through the clashing they made in her brain she felt a sudden uncontrollable longing that they should provoke in him a cry of protest of resistance oh if he refused to let her go if he caught her to him and defied the world to part them what then of her pledge to mr langhope what then of her resolve to pay the penalty alone but in the space of a heartbeat she knew that peril that longedfor peril was past her husband had remained silent he neither moved toward her nor looked at her and she felt in every slackening nerve that in the end he would let her go xl mr langhope tossing down a note on mrs ansells drawingroom table commanded imperiously read that she set aside her teacup and looked up not at the note but into his face which was crossed by one of the waves of heat and tremulousness that she was beginning to fear for him mr langhope had changed greatly in the last three months and as he stood there in the clear light of the june afternoon it came to her that he had at last suffered the sudden collapse which is the penalty of youth preserved beyond its time what is it she asked still watching him as she put out her hand for the letter amherst writes to remind me of my promise to take cicely to hanaford next week for her birthday well it was a promise wasnt it she rejoined running her eyes over the page a promise yes but made before read the note youll see theres no reference to his wife for all i know shell be there to receive us but that was a promise too that neither cicely nor i should ever set eyes on her yes but why should she keep it i was a fool that day she fooled me as shes fooled us all but you saw through it from the beginning you said at once that shed never leave him mrs ansell reflected i said that before i knew all the circumstances now i think differently you think she still means to go she handed the letter back to him i think this is to tell you so this he groped for his glasses dubiously scanning the letter again yes and whats more if you refuse to go shell have every right to break her side of the agreement mr langhope sank into a chair steadying himself painfully with his stick upon my soul i sometimes think youre on her side he ejaculated no but i like fair play she returned measuring his tea carefully into his favourite little porcelain teapot fair play shes offering to do her part its for you to do yours now to take cicely to hanaford if i find her there i never cross amhersts threshold again mrs ansell without answering rose and put his teacup on the slenderlegged table at his elbow then before returning to her seat she found the enamelled matchbox and laid it by the cup it was becoming difficult for mr langhope to guide his movements about her small encumbered room and he had always liked being waited on mrs ansells prognostication proved correct when mr langhope and cicely arrived at hanaford they found amherst alone to receive them he explained briefly that his wife had been unwell and had gone to seek rest and change at the house of an old friend in the west mr langhope expressed a decent amount of regret and the subject was dropped as if by common consent cicely however was not so easily silenced poor bessys uncertain fits of tenderness had produced more bewilderment than pleasure in her soberminded child but the little girls feelings and perceptions had developed rapidly in the equable atmosphere of her stepmothers affection cicely had reached the age when children put their questions with as much ingenuity as persistence and both mr langhope and amherst longed for mrs ansells aid in parrying her incessant interrogations as to the cause and length of justines absence what she had said before going and what promise she had made about coming back but mrs ansell had not come to hanaford though it had become a matter of habit to include her in the family pilgrimages to the mills she had firmly maintained the plea of more urgent engagements and the two men with only cicely between them had spent the long days and longer evenings in unaccustomed and unmitigated propinquity mr langhope before leaving thought it proper to touch tentatively on his promise of giving cicely to amherst for the summer but to his surprise the latter after a moment of hesitation replied that he should probably go to europe for two or three months to europe alone escaped from mr langhope before he had time to weigh his words amherst frowned slightly i have been made a delegate to the berne conference on the housing of factory operatives he said at length without making a direct reply to the question and if there is nothing to keep me at westmore i shall probably go out in july he waited a moment and then added my wife has decided to spend the summer in michigan mr langhopes answer was a vague murmur of assent and amherst turned the talk to other matters mr langhope returned to town with distinct views on the situation at hanaford poor devil im sorry for him he can hardly speak of her he broke out at once to mrs ansell in the course of their first confidential hour together because he cares too much hes too unhappy because he loathes her mr langhope brought out with emphasis mrs ansell drew a deep sigh which made him add accusingly i believe youre actually sorry sorry she raised her eyebrows with a slight smile should one not always be sorry to know theres a little less love and a little more hate in the world youll be asking me not to hate her next she still continued to smile on him its the haters not the hated im sorry for she said at length and he flung back impatiently oh dont lets talk of her i sometimes feel she takes up more place in our lives than when she was with us amherst went to the berne conference in july and spent six weeks afterward in rapid visits to various industrial centres and model factory villages during his previous european pilgrimages his interest had by no means been restricted to sociological questions the appeal of an old civilization reaching him through its innumerable forms of tradition and beauty had roused that side of his imagination which his work at home left untouched but upon his present state of deep moral commotion the spells of art and history were powerless to work the foundations of his life had been shaken and the fair exterior of the world was as vacant as a maniacs face he could only take refuge in his special task barricading himself against every expression of beauty and poetry as so many poignant reminders of a phase of life that he was vainly trying to cast off and forget even his work had been embittered to him thrust out of its place in the ordered scheme of things it had cost him a hard struggle to hold fast to his main purpose to convince himself that his real duty lay not in renouncing the westmore money and its obligations but in carrying out his projected task as if nothing had occurred to affect his personal relation to it the mere fact that such a renunciation would have been a deliberate moral suicide a severing once for all of every artery of action made it take on at first the semblance of an obligation a sort of higher duty to the abstract conception of what he owed himself but justine had not erred in her forecast once she had passed out of his life it was easier for him to return to a dispassionate view of his situation to see and boldly confess to himself that he saw the still higher duty of sticking to his task instead of sacrificing it to any ideal of personal disinterestedness it was this gradual process of adjustment that saved him from the desolating scepticism which falls on the active man when the sources of his activity are tainted having accepted his fate having consented to see in himself merely the necessary agent of a good to be done he could escape from selfquestioning only by shutting himself up in the practical exigencies of his work closing his eyes and his thoughts to everything which had formerly related it to a wider world had given meaning and beauty to life as a whole the return from europe and the taking up of the daily routine at hanaford were the most difficult phases in this process of moral adaptation justines departure had at first brought relief he had been too sincere with himself to oppose her wish to leave hanaford for a time since he believed that for her as well as for himself a temporary separation would be less painful than a continuance of their actual relation but as the weeks passed into months he found he was no nearer to a clear view of his own case the future was still dark and enigmatic justines desire to leave him had revived his unformulated distrust of her what could it mean but that there were thoughts within her which could not be at rest in his presence he had given her every proof of his wish to forget the past and mr langhope had behaved with unequalled magnanimity yet justines unhappiness was evident she could not conceal her longing to escape from the conditions her act had created was it because in reality she was conscious of other motives than the one she acknowledged she had insisted almost unfeelingly as it might have seemed on the abstract rightness of what she had done on the fact that ideally speaking her act could not be made less right less justifiable by the special accidental consequences that had flowed from it because these consequences had caught her in a web of tragic fatality she would not be guilty of the weakness of tracing back the disaster to any intrinsic error in her original motive why then if this was her real her proud attitude toward the past and since those about her believed in her sincerity and accepted her justification as valid from her point of view if not from theirs why had she not been able to maintain her posture to carry on life on the terms she had exacted from others a special circumstance contributed to this feeling of distrust the fact namely that justine a week after her departure from hanaford had written to say that she could not from that moment till her return consent to accept any money from amherst as her manner was she put her reasons clearly and soberly without evasion or ambiguity since you and i she wrote have always agreed in regarding the westmore money as a kind of wage for our services at the mills i cannot be satisfied to go on drawing that wage while i am unable to do any work in return i am sure you must feel as i do about this and you need have no anxiety as to the practical side of the question since i have enough to live on in some savings from my hospital days which were invested for me two years ago by harry dressel and are beginning to bring in a small return this being the case i feel i can afford to interpret in any way i choose the terms of the bargain between myself and westmore on reading this amhersts mind had gone through the strange dual process which now marked all his judgments of his wife at first he had fancied he understood her and had felt that he should have done as she did then the usual reaction of distrust set in and he asked himself why she who had so little of the conventional attitude toward money should now develop this unexpected susceptibility and so the old question presented itself in another shape if she had nothing to reproach herself for why was it intolerable to her to live on bessys money the fact that she was doing no actual service at westmore did not account for her scruples she would have been the last person to think that a sick servant should be docked of his pay her reluctance could come only from that hidden cause of compunction which had prompted her departure and which now forced her to sever even the merely material links between herself and her past amherst on his return to hanaford had tried to find in these considerations a reason for his deep unrest it was his wifes course which still cast a torturing doubt on what he had braced his will to accept and put behind him and he now told himself that the perpetual galling sense of her absence was due to this uneasy consciousness of what it meant of the dark secrets it enveloped and held back from him in actual truth every particle of his being missed her he lacked her at every turn she had been at once the partner of his task and the pays bleu into which he escaped from it the vivifying thought which gave meaning to the life he had chosen yet never let him forget that there was a larger richer life outside to which he was rooted by deeper and more intrinsic things than any abstract ideal of altruism his love had preserved his identity saved him from shrinking into the mere nameless unit which the social enthusiast is in danger of becoming unless the humanitarian passion is balanced and a little overweighed by a merely human one and now this equilibrium was lost forever and his deepest pain lay in realizing that he could not regain it even by casting off westmore and choosing the narrower but richer individual existence that her love might once have offered his life was in truth one indivisible organism not two halves artificially united self and otherself were ingrown from the roots whichever portion fate restricted him to would be but a mutilated halflive fragment of the whole happily for him chance made this crisis of his life coincide with a strike at westmore soon after his return to hanaford he found himself compelled to grapple with the hardest problem of his industrial career and he was carried through the ensuing three months on that tide of swift obligatory action that sweeps the shipwrecked spirit over so many sunken reefs of fear and despair the knowledge that he was better able to deal with the question than any one who might conceivably have taken his place this conviction which was presently confirmed by the peaceable adjustment of the strike helped to make the sense of his immediate usefulness outbalance that other disintegrating doubt as to the final value of such efforts and so he tried to settle down into a kind of mechanical altruism in which the reflexes of habit should take the place of that daily renewal of faith and enthusiasm which had been fed from the springs of his own joy the autumn came and passed into winter and after mr langhopes reestablishment in town amherst began to resume his usual visits to his stepdaughter his natural affection for the little girl had been deepened by the unforeseen manner in which her fate had been entrusted to him the thought of bessy softened to compunction by the discovery that her love had persisted under their apparently hopeless estrangement this feeling intensified to the verge of morbidness by the circumstances attending her death now sought expression in a passionate devotion to her child accident had in short created between bessy and himself a retrospective sympathy which the resumption of life together would have dispelled in a week one of the exhalations from the past that depress the vitality of those who linger too near the grave of dead experiences since justines departure amherst had felt himself still more drawn to cicely but his relation to the child was complicated by the fact that she would not be satisfied as to the cause of her stepmothers absence whenever amherst came to town her first question was for justine and her memory had the precocious persistence sometimes developed in children too early deprived of their natural atmosphere of affection cicely had always been petted and adored at odd times and by divers people but some instinct seemed to tell her that of all the tenderness bestowed on her justines most resembled the allpervading motherly element in which the childs heart expands without ever being conscious of its needs if it had been embarrassing to evade cicelys questions in june it became doubly so as the months passed and the pretext of justines illhealth grew more and more difficult to sustain and in the following march amherst was suddenly called from hanaford by the news that the little girl herself was ill serious complications had developed from a protracted case of scarlet fever and for two weeks the childs fate was uncertain then she began to recover and in the joy of seeing life come back to her mr langhope and amherst felt as though they must not only gratify every wish she expressed but try to guess at those they saw floating below the surface of her clear vague eyes it was noticeable to mrs ansell if not to the others that one of these unexpressed wishes was the desire to see her stepmother cicely no longer asked for justine but something in her silence or in the gesture with which she gently put from her other offers of diversion and companionship suddenly struck mrs ansell as more poignant than speech what is it the child wants she asked the governess in the course of one of their whispered consultations and the governess after a moments hesitation replied she said something about a letter she wrote to mrs amherst just before she was taken ill about having had no answer i think ah she writes to mrs amherst does she the governess evidently aware that she trod on delicate ground tried at once to defend herself and her pupil it was my fault perhaps i suggested once that her little compositions should take the form of letters it usually interests a child more and she asked if they might be written to mrs amherst your fault why should not the child write to her stepmother mrs ansell rejoined with studied surprise and on the others murmuring of course of course she added haughtily i trust the letters were sent the governess floundered i couldnt say but perhaps the nurse that evening cicely was less well there was a slight return of fever and the doctor hastily summoned hinted at the possibility of too much excitement in the sickroom excitement there has been no excitement mr langhope protested quivering with the sudden renewal of fear no the child seemed nervous uneasy its hard to say why because she is unusually reserved for her age the medical man took his departure and mr langhope and mrs ansell faced each other in the disarray produced by a call to arms when all has seemed at peace i shall lose her i shall lose her the grandfather broke out sinking into his chair with a groan mrs ansell gathering up her furs for departure turned on him abruptly from the threshold its stupid what youre doing stupid she exclaimed with unwonted vehemence he raised his head with a startled look what do you mean what im doing the child misses justine you ought to send for her mr langhopes hands dropped to the arms of his chair and he straightened himself up with a pale flash of indignation youve had moments lately ive had moments yes and so have you when the child came back to us and we stood there and wondered how we could keep her tie her fastand in those moments i sawsaw what she wantedand so did you mr langhope turned away his head youre a sentimentalist he flung scornfully back oh call me any bad names you please i wont send for that woman no she fastened her furs slowly with the gentle deliberate movements that no emotion ever hastened or disturbed why do you say no he challenged her to make you contradict me perhaps she ventured after looking at him again ah he shifted his position one elbow supporting his bowed head his eyes fixed on the ground presently he brought out could one ask her to come and see the child and go away again for good to break the compact at your pleasure and enter into it again for the same reason no no i see he paused and then looked up at her suddenly but what if amherst wont have her back himself shall i ask him i tell you he cant bear to hear her name but he doesnt know why she has left him mr langhope gathered his brows in a frown why what on earth what possible difference would that make mrs ansell from the doorway shed a pitying glance on him ah if you dont see she murmured he sank back into his seat with a groan good heavens maria how you torture me i see enough as it is i see too much of the cursed business she paused again and then slowly moved a step or two nearer laying her hand on his shoulder theres one thing youve never seen yet henry what bessy herself would do now for the child if she could he sat motionless under her light touch his eyes on hers till their inmost thoughts felt for and found each other as they still sometimes could through the fog of years and selfishness and worldly habit then he dropped his face into his hands hiding it from her with the instinctive shrinking of an aged grief xli amherst cicelys convalescence once assured had been obliged to go back to hanaford but some ten days later on hearing from mrs ansell that the little girls progress was less rapid than had been hoped he returned to his fatherinlaws for a sunday he came two days after the talk recorded in the last chapter a talk of which mrs ansells letter to him had been the direct result she had promised mr langhope that in writing to amherst she would not go beyond the briefest statement of fact and she had kept her word trusting to circumstances to speak for her mrs ansell during cicelys illness had formed the habit of dropping in on mr langhope at the tea hour instead of awaiting him in her own drawingroom and on the sunday in question she found him alone beneath his pleasure in seeing her which had grown more marked as his dependence on her increased she at once discerned traces of recent disturbance and her first question was for cicely he met it with a discouraged gesture no great change amherst finds her less well than when he was here before hes upstairs with her yes she seems to want him mrs ansell seated herself in silence behind the teatray of which she was now recognized as the officiating priestess as she drew off her long gloves and mechanically straightened the row of delicate old cups mr langhope added with an effort ive spoken to him told him what you said she looked up quickly about the childs wish he continued about her having written to his wife it seems her last letters have not been answered he paused and mrs ansell with her usual calm precision proceeded to measure the tea into the fluted georgian teapot she could be as reticent in approval as in reprehension and not for the world would she have seemed to claim any share in the turn that events appeared to be taking she even preferred the risk of leaving her old friend to add halfreproachfully i told amherst what you and the nurse thought yes that cicely pines for his wife i put it to him in black and white the words came out on a deep strained breath and mrs ansell faltered well well he doesnt know where she is himself doesnt know theyre separated utterly separated its as i told you he could hardly name her mrs ansell had unconsciously ceased her ministrations letting her hands fall on her knee while she brooded in blank wonder on her companions face i wonder what reason she could have given him she murmured at length for going he loathes her i tell you yes but how did she make him he struck his hand violently on the arm of his chair upon my soul you seem to forget no she shook her head with a half smile i simply remember more than you do what more he began with a flush of anger but she raised a quieting hand what does all that matter if now that we need her we cant get her he made no answer and she returned to the dispensing of his tea but as she rose to put the cup in his hand he asked half querulously you think its going to be very bad for the child then mrs ansell smiled with the thin edge of her lips one can hardly set the police after her no were powerless he groaned in assent as the cup passed between them she dropped her eyes to his with a quick flash of interrogation but he sat staring moodily before him and she moved back to the sofa without a word on the way downstairs she met amherst descending from cicelys room since the early days of his first marriage there had always been on amhersts side a sense of obscure antagonism toward mrs ansell she was almost the embodied spirit of the world he dreaded and disliked her serenity her tolerance her adaptability seemed to smile away and disintegrate all the high enthusiasms the stubborn convictions that he had tried to plant in the shifting sands of his married life and now that bessys death had given her back the attributes with which his fancy had originally invested her he had come to regard mrs ansell as embodying the evil influences that had come between himself and his wife mrs ansell was probably not unaware of the successive transitions of feeling which had led up to this unflattering view but her life had been passed among petty rivalries and animosities and she had the patience and adroitness of the spy in a hostile camp she and amherst exchanged a few words about cicely then she exclaimed with a glance through the panes of the hall door but i must be off im on foot and the crossings appal me after dark he could do no less at that than offer to guide her across the perils of fifth avenue and still talking of cicely she led him down the thronged thoroughfare till her own corner was reached and then her own door turning there to ask as if by an afterthought wont you come up theres one thing more i want to say a shade of reluctance crossed his face which as the vestibule light fell on it looked hard and tired like a face set obstinately against a winter gale but he murmured a word of assent and followed her into the shining steel cage of the lift in her little drawingroom among the shaded lamps and bowls of spring flowers she pushed a chair forward settled herself in her usual corner of the sofa and said with a directness that seemed an echo of his own tone i asked you to come up because i want to talk to you about mr langhope amherst looked at her in surprise though his fatherinlaws health had been more or less unsatisfactory for the last year all their concern of late had been for cicely you think him less well he enquired she waited to draw off and smooth her gloves with one of the deliberate gestures that served to shade and supplement her speech i think him extremely unhappy amherst moved uneasily in his seat he did not know where she meant the talk to lead them but he guessed that it would be over painful places and he saw no reason why he should be forced to follow her you mean that hes still anxious about cicely partly that yes she paused the child will get well no doubt but she is very lonely she needs youth heat light mr langhope cant give her those or even a semblance of them and its an art ive lost the secret of she added with her shadowy smile amhersts brows darkened i realize all she has lost mrs ansell glanced up at him quickly she is twice motherless she said the blood rose to his neck and temples and he tightened his hand on the arm of his chair but it was a part of mrs ansells expertness to know when such danger signals must be heeded and when they might be ignored and she went on quietly its the question of the future that is troubling mr langhope after such an illness the next months of cicelys life should be all happiness and money wont buy the kind she needs one cant pick out the right companion for such a child as one can match a ribbon what she wants is spontaneous affection not the most superlative manufactured article she wants the sort of love that justine gave her it was the first time in months that amherst had heard his wifes name spoken outside of his own house no one but his mother mentioned justine to him now and of late even his mother had dropped her enquiries and allusions prudently acquiescing in the habit of silence which his own silence had created about him to hear the name again the two little syllables which had been the key of life to him and now shook him as the turning of a rusted lock shakes a longclosed door to hear her name spoken familiarly affectionately as one speaks of some one who may come into the room the next moment gave him a shock that was half pain and half furtive unacknowledged joy men whose conscious thoughts are mostly projected outward on the world of external activities may be more moved by such a touch on the feelings than those who are perpetually testing and tuning their emotional chords amherst had foreseen from the first that mrs ansell might mean to speak of his wife but though he had intended if she did so to cut their talk short he now felt himself irresistibly constrained to hear her out mrs ansell having sped her shaft followed its flight through lowered lashes and saw that it had struck a vulnerable point but she was far from assuming that the day was won i believe she continued that mr langhope has said something of this to you already and my only excuse for speaking is that i understood he had not been successful in his appeal no one but mrs ansell and perhaps she knew it could have pushed so far beyond the conventional limits of discretion without seeming to overstep them by a hair and she had often said when pressed for the secret of her art that it consisted simply in knowing the password that word once spoken she might have added the next secret was to give the enemy no time for resistance and though she saw the frown reappear between amhersts eyes she went on without heeding it i entreat you mr amherst to let cicely see your wife he reddened again and pushed back his chair as if to rise no dont break off like that let me say a word more i know your answer to mr langhope that you and justine are no longer together but i thought of you as a man to sink your personal relations at such a moment as this to sink them he repeated vaguely and she went on after all what difference does it make what difference he stared in unmitigated wonder and then answered with a touch of irony it might at least make the difference of my being unwilling to ask a favour of her mrs ansell at this raised her eyes and let them rest full on his because she has done you so great a one already he stared again sinking back automatically into his chair i dont understand you no she smiled a little as if to give herself time but i mean that you shall if i were a man i suppose i couldnt because a mans code of honour is such a clumsy castiron thing but a womans luckily can be cut over if shes clever to fit any new occasion and in this case i should be willing to reduce mine to tatters if necessary amhersts look of bewilderment deepened what is it that i dont understand he asked at length in a low voice well first of all why mr langhope had the right to ask you to send for your wife the right you dont recognize such a right on his part no why should i supposing she had left you by his wish his wish his he was on his feet now gazing at her blindly while the solid world seemed to grow thin about him her next words reduced it to a mist my poor amherst why else on earth should she have left you she brought it out clearly in her small chiming tones and as the sound travelled toward him it seemed to gather momentum till her words rang through his brain as if every incomprehensible incident in the past had suddenly boomed forth the question why else indeed should she have left him he stood motionless for a while then he approached mrs ansell and said tell me she drew farther back into her corner of the sofa waving him to a seat beside her as though to bring his inquisitory eyes on a level where her own could command them but he stood where he was unconscious of her gesture and merely repeating tell me she may have said to herself that a woman would have needed no farther telling but to him she only replied slanting her head up to his to spare you and himself pain to keep everything between himself and you as it had been before you married her he dropped down beside her at that grasping the back of the sofa as if he wanted something to clutch and throttle the veins swelled in his temples and as he pushed back his tossed hair mrs ansell noticed for the first time how gray it had grown on the under side and he asked this of my wife he accepted it havent you accepted it i how could i guess her reasons how could i imagine mrs ansell raised her brows a hairs breadth at that i dont know but as a fact he didnt ask it was she who offered who forced it on him even forced her going on him in a sense yes by making it appear that you felt as he did about about poor bessys death that the thought of what had happened at that time was as abhorrent to you as to him that she was as abhorrent to you no doubt she foresaw that had she permitted the least doubt on that point there would have been no need of her leaving you since the relation between yourself and mr langhope would have been altered destroyed yes i expected that i warned her of it but how did she make him think how can i tell to begin with i dont know your real feeling for all i know she was telling the truth and mr langhope of course thought she was that i abhorred her oh he broke out on his feet in an instant then why why did i let her leave me he strode across the room as his habit was in moments of agitation turning back to her again before he answered because i didnt know didnt know anything and because her insisting on going away like that without any explanation made me feelimagine there wassomething she didnt want me to knowsomething she was afraid of not being able to hide from me if we stayed together any longer well there was the extent to which she loved you mrs ansell her hands clasped on her knee her gaze holding his with a kind of visionary fixity seemed to reconstruct the history of his past bit by bit with the words she was dragging out of him i see it i see it all now she went on with a repressed fervour that he had never divined in her it was the only solution for her as well as for the rest of you the more she showed her love the more it would have cast a doubt on her motivethe greater distance she would have put between herself and you and so she showed it in the only way that was safe for both of you by taking herself away and hiding it in her heart and before going she secured your peace of mind your future if she ruined anything she rebuilt the ruin oh she paid she paid in full justine had paid yes paid to the utmost limit of whatever debt toward society she had contracted by overstepping its laws and her resolve to discharge the debt had been taken in a flash as soon as she had seen that man can commit no act alone whether for good or evil the extent to which amhersts fate was involved in hers had become clear to her with his first word of reassurance of faith in her motive and instantly a plan for releasing him had leapt fullformed into her mind and had been carried out with swift unflinching resolution as he forced himself now to look down the suddenly illuminated past to the weeks which had elapsed between her visit to mr langhope and her departure from hanaford he wondered not so much at her swiftness of resolve as at her firmness in carrying out her plan and he saw with a blinding flash of insight that it was in her love for him that she had found her strength in all moments of strong mental tension he became totally unconscious of time and place and he now remained silent so long his hands clasped behind him his eyes fixed on an indeterminate point in space that mrs ansell at length rose and laid a questioning touch on his arm its not true that you dont know where she is his face contracted at this moment i dont lately she has preferrednot to write but surely you must know how to find her he tossed back his hair with an energetic movement i should find her if i didnt know how they stood confronted in a gaze of silent intensity each penetrating farther into the mind of the other than would once have seemed possible to either one then amherst held out his hand abruptly goodbye and thank you he said she detained him a moment we shall see you soon again see you both his face grew stern its not to oblige mr langhope that i am going to find my wife ah now you are unjust to him she exclaimed dont let us speak of him he broke in why not when it is from him the request comes the entreaty that everything in the past should be forgotten yes when it suits his convenience do you imagine that even judging him in that way it has not cost him a struggle i can only think of what it has cost her mrs ansell drew a deep sighing breath ah but dont you see that she has gained her point and that nothing else matters to her gained her point not if by that you mean that things here can ever go back to the old state that she and i can remain at westmore after this mrs ansell dropped her eyes for a moment then she lifted to his her sweet impenetrable face do you know what you have to do both you and he exactly what she decides she affirmed xlii justines answer to her husbands letter bore a new york address and the surprise of finding her in the same town with himself and not half an hours walk from the room in which he sat was so great that it seemed to demand some sudden and violent outlet of physical movement he thrust the letter in his pocket took up his hat and leaving the house strode up fifth avenue toward the park in the early spring sunlight the news had taken five days to reach him for in order to reestablish communication with his wife he had been obliged to write to michigan with the request that his letter should be forwarded he had never supposed that justine would be hard to find or that she had purposely enveloped her movements in mystery when she ceased to write he had simply concluded that like himself she felt the mockery of trying to keep up a sort of distant semifraternal relation marked by the occasional interchange of inexpressive letters the inextricable mingling of thought and sensation which made the peculiar closeness of their union could never to such direct and passionate natures be replaced by the pretense of a temperate friendship feeling thus himself and instinctively assuming the same feeling in his wife amherst had respected her silence her wish to break definitely with their former life she had written him in the autumn that she intended to leave michigan for a few months but that in any emergency a letter addressed to her friends house would reach her and he had taken this as meaning that unless the emergency arose she preferred that their correspondence should cease acquiescence was all the easier because it accorded with his own desire it seemed to him as he looked back that the love he and justine had felt for each other was like some rare organism which could maintain life only in its special element and that element was neither passion nor sentiment but truth it was only on the heights that they could breathe some men in his place even while accepting the inevitableness of the moral rupture would have felt concerned for the material side of the case but it was characteristic of amherst that this did not trouble him he took it for granted that his wife would return to her nursing from the first he had felt certain that it would be intolerable to her to accept aid from him and that she would choose rather to support herself by the exercise of her regular profession and aside from such motives he who had always turned to hard work as the rarest refuge from personal misery thought it natural that she should seek the same means of escape he had therefore not been surprised on opening her letter that morning to learn that she had taken up her hospital work but in the amazement of finding her so near he hardly grasped her explanation of the coincidence there was something about a buffalo patient suddenly ordered to new york for special treatment and refusing to go in with a new nurse but these details made no impression on his mind which had only room for the fact that chance had brought his wife back at the very moment when his whole being yearned for her she wrote that owing to her duties she would be unable to see him till three that afternoon and he had still six hours to consume before their meeting but in spirit they had met already they were one in an intensity of communion which as he strode northward along the bright crowded thoroughfare seemed to gather up the whole world into one throbbing point of life he had a boyish wish to keep the secret of his happiness to himself not to let mr langhope or mrs ansell know of his meeting with justine till it was over and after twice measuring the length of the park he turned in at one of the little wooden restaurants which were beginning to unshutter themselves in anticipation of spring custom if only he could have seen justine that morning if he could have brought her there and they could have sat opposite each other in the bare empty room with sparrows bustling and twittering in the lilacs against the open window the room was ugly enough but how she would have delighted in the delicate green of the near slopes and the purplish haze of the woods beyond she took a childish pleasure in such small adventures and had the knack of giving a touch of magic to their most commonplace details amherst as he finished his cold beef and indifferent eggs found himself boyishly planning to bring her back there the next day then over the coffee he reread her letter the address she gave was that of a small private hospital and she explained that she would have to receive him in the public parlour which at that hour was open to other visitors as the time approached the thought that they might not be alone when they met became insufferable and he determined if he found any one else in possession of the parlour to wait in the hall and meet her as she came down the stairs he continued to elaborate this plan as he walked back slowly through the park he had timed himself to reach the hospital a little before three but though it lacked five minutes to the hour when he entered the parlour two women were already seated in one of its windows they looked around as he came in evidently as much annoyed by his appearance as he had been to find them there the older of the two showed a sallow middleaged face beneath her limp crape veil the other was a slight tawdry creature with nodding feathers and innumerable chains and bracelets which she fingered ceaselessly as she talked they eyed amherst with resentment and then turned away continuing their talk in low murmurs while he seated himself at the marbletopped table littered with torn magazines now and then the younger womans voice rose in a shrill staccato and a phrase or two floated over to him shed simply worked herself to death the nurse told me so she expects to go home in another week though how shes going to stand the fatigue and then after an inaudible answer its all his fault and if i was her i wouldnt go back to him for anything oh cora hes real sorry now the older woman protestingly murmured but the other unappeased rejoined with ominously nodding plumes you see if they do make it up itll never be the same between them amherst started up nervously and as he did so the clock struck three and he opened the door and passed out into the hall it was paved with black and white marble the walls were washed in a dull yellowish tint and the prevalent odour of antiseptics was mingled with a stale smell of cooking at the back rose a straight staircase carpeted with brassbound indiarubber like a ships companionway and down that staircase she would come in a moment he fancied he heard her step now but the step was that of an elderly blackgowned woman in a cap the matron probably she glanced at amherst in surprise and asked are you waiting for some one he made a motion of assent and she opened the parlour door saying please walk in may i not wait out here he urged she looked at him more attentively why no im afraid not youll find the papers and magazines in here mildly but firmly she drove him in before her and closing the door advanced to the two women in the window amhersts hopes leapt up perhaps she had come to fetch the visitors upstairs he strained his ears to catch what was being said and while he was thus absorbed the door opened and turning at the sound he found himself face to face with his wife he had not reflected that justine would be in her nurses dress and the sight of the dark blue uniform and small white cap in which he had never seen her since their first meeting in the hope hospital obliterated all bitter and unhappy memories and gave him the illusion of passing back at once into the clear air of their early friendship then he looked at her and remembered he noticed that she had grown thinner than ever or rather that her thinness which had formerly had a healthy reedlike strength now suggested fatigue and languor and her face was spent extinguished the very eyes were lifeless all her vitality seemed to have withdrawn itself into the arch of dense black hair which still clasped her forehead like the noble metal of some antique bust the sight stirred him with a deeper pity a more vehement compunction but the impulse to snatch her to him and seek his pardon on her lips was paralyzed by the sense that the three women in the window had stopped talking and turned their heads toward the door he held his hand out and justines touched it for a moment then he said in a low voice is there no other place where i can see you she made a negative gesture i am afraid not today ah her deep sweet voice how completely his ear had lost the sound of it she looked doubtfully about the room and pointed to a sofa at the end farthest from the windows shall we sit there she said he followed her in silence and they sat down side by side the matron had drawn up a chair and resumed her whispered conference with the women in the window between the two groups stretched the bare length of the room broken only by a few armchairs of stained wood and the marbletopped table covered with magazines the impossibility of giving free rein to his feelings developed in amherst an unwonted intensity of perception as though a sixth sense had suddenly emerged to take the place of those he could not use and with this newmade faculty he seemed to gather up and absorb into himself as he had never done in their hours of closest communion every detail of his wifes person of her face and hands and gestures he noticed how her full upper lids of the tint of yellowish ivory had a slight bluish discolouration and how little threadlike blue veins ran across her temples to the roots of her hair the emaciation of her face and the hollow shades beneath her cheekbones made her mouth seem redder and fuller though a little line on each side where it joined the cheek gave it a tragic droop and her hands when her fingers met his he recalled having once picked up in the winter woods the little featherlight skeleton of a frozen bird and that was what her touch was like and it was he who had brought her to this by his cruelty his obtuseness his base readiness to believe the worst of her he did not want to pour himself out in selfaccusation that seemed too easy a way of escape he wanted simply to take her in his arms to ask her to give him one more chance and then to show her and all the while he was paralyzed by the group in the window cant we go out i must speak to you he began again nervously not this afternoon the doctor is coming tomorrow i cant wait for tomorrow she made a faint imperceptible gesture which read to his eyes youve waited a whole year yes i know he returned still constrained by the necessity of muffling his voice of perpetually measuring the distance between themselves and the window i know what you might say dont you suppose ive said it to myself a million times but i didnt know i couldnt imagine she interrupted him with a rapid movement what do you know now what you promised langhope she turned her startled eyes on him and he saw the blood run flamelike under her skin but he promised not to speak she cried he hasnt to me but such things make themselves known should you have been content to go on in that way forever she raised her head and her eyes rested in his if you were she answered simply justine again she checked him with a silencing motion please tell me just what has happened not now theres too much else to say and nothing matters except that im with you but mr langhope he asks you to come youre to see cicely tomorrow her lower lip trembled a little and a tear flowed over and hung on her lashes but what does all that matter now were together after this horrible year he insisted she looked at him again but what is really changed everything everything not changed i mean just gone back to wherewe werebefore she whispered and he whispered back to where we were before there was a scraping of chairs on the floor and with a sense of release amherst saw that the colloquy in the window was over the two visitors gathering their wraps about them moved slowly across the room still talking to the matron in excited undertones through which as they neared the threshold the younger womans staccato again broke out i tell you if she does go back to him itll never be the same between them oh cora i wouldnt say that the other ineffectually wailed then they moved toward the door and a moment later it had closed on them amherst turned to his wife with outstretched arms say you forgive me justine she held back a little from his entreating hands not reproachfully but as if with a last scruple for himself theres nothing leftof the horror she asked below her breath to be without you thats the only horror youre sure sure its just the same to youjust as it wasbefore just the same justine its not for myself but you then for me never speak of it he implored because its not the same then leapt from her because its wiped out because its never been never never he felt her yield to him at that and under his eyes close under his lips was her face at last but as they kissed they heard the handle of the door turn and drew apart quickly her hand lingering in his under the fold of her dress a nurse looked in dressed in the white uniform and pointed cap of the hospital amherst fancied that she smiled a little as she saw them miss brent the doctor wants you to come right up and give the morphine the door shut again as justine rose to her feet amherst remained seated he had made no motion to retain her hand as it slipped from him im coming she called out to the retreating nurse then she turned slowly and saw her husbands face i must go she said in a low tone her eyes met his for a moment but he looked away again as he stood up and reached for his hat tomorrow then he said without attempting to detain her tomorrow you must come away from here you must come home he repeated mechanically she made no answer and he held his hand out and took hers tomorrow he said drawing her toward him and their lips met again but not in the same kiss xliii june again at hanaford and cicelys birthday the anniversary was to coincide this year with the opening of the old house at hopewood as a kind of pleasurepalace gymnasium concerthall and museum for the recreation of the millhands the idea had first come to amherst on the winter afternoon when bessy westmore had confessed her love for him under the snowladen trees of hopewood even then the sense that his personal happiness was enlarged and secured by its promise of happiness to others had made him wish that the scene associated with the opening of his new life should be made to commemorate a corresponding change in the fortunes of westmore but when the control of the mills passed into his hands other and more necessary improvements pressed upon him and it was not till now that the financial condition of the company had permitted the execution of his plan justine on her return to hanaford had found the work already in progress and had been told by her husband that he was carrying out a projected scheme of bessys she had felt a certain surprise but had concluded that the plan in question dated back to the early days of his first marriage when in his wifes eyes his connection with the mills still invested them with interest since justine had come back to her husband both had tacitly avoided all allusions to the past and the recreationhouse at hopewood being as she divined in some sort an expiatory offering to bessys plaintive shade she had purposely refrained from questioning amherst about its progress and had simply approved the plans he submitted to her fourteen months had passed since her return and now as she sat beside her husband in the carriage which was conveying them to hopewood she said to herself that her life had at last fallen into what promised to be its final shape that as things now were they would probably be to the end and outwardly at least they were what she and amherst had always dreamed of their being westmore prospered under the new rule the seeds of life they had sown there were springing up in a promising growth of bodily health and mental activity and above all in a dawning social consciousness the millhands were beginning to understand the meaning of their work in its relation to their own lives and to the larger economy and outwardly also the new growth was showing itself in the humanized aspect of the place amhersts young maples were tall enough now to cast a shade on the grassbordered streets and the wellkept turf the bright cottage gardens the new central group of library hospital and clubhouse gave to the millvillage the hopeful air of a rising residential suburb in the bright june light behind their fresh green mantle of trees and creepers even the factory buildings looked less stern and prisonlike than formerly and the turfing and planting of the adjoining riverbanks had transformed a waste of foul mud and refuse into a little park where the operatives might refresh themselves at midday yes westmore was alive at last the dead city of which justine had once spoken had risen from its grave and its blank face had taken on a meaning as justine glanced at her husband she saw that the same thought was in his mind however achieved at whatever cost of personal misery and error the work of awakening and freeing westmore was done and that work had justified itself she looked from amherst to cicely who sat opposite eager and rosy in her mourning frock for mr langhope had died some two months previously and as intent as her stepparents on the scene before her cicely was old enough now to regard her connection with westmore as something more than a nursery game she was beginning to learn a great deal about the mills and to understand in simple friendly ways something of her own relation to them the work and play of the children the interests and relaxations provided for their elders had been gradually explained to her by justine and she knew that this shining tenth birthday of hers was to throw its light as far as the clouds of factorysmoke extended as they mounted the slope to hopewood the spacious white building with its enfolding colonnades its broad terraces and tenniscourts shone through the trees like some bright countryhouse adorned for its masters homecoming and amherst and his wife might have been driving up to the house which had been built to shelter their wedded happiness the thought flashed across justine as their carriage climbed the hill she was as much absorbed as amherst in the welfare of westmore it had become more and more to both the refuge in which their lives still met and mingled but for a moment as they paused before the flowerdecked porch and he turned to help her from the carriage it occurred to her to wonder what her sensations would have been if he had been bringing her home to a real home of their own instead of accompanying her to another philanthropic celebration but what need had they of a real home when they no longer had any real life of their own nothing was left of that secret inner union which had so enriched and beautified their outward lives since justines return to hanaford they had entered tacitly almost unconsciously into a new relation to each other a relation in which their personalities were more and more merged in their common work so that as it were they met only by avoiding each other from the first justine had accepted this as inevitable just as she had understood when amherst had sought her out in new york that his remaining at westmore which had once been contingent on her leaving him now depended on her willingness to return and take up their former life she accepted the last condition as she had accepted the other pledged to the perpetual expiation of an act for which in the abstract she still refused to hold herself to blame but life is not a matter of abstract principles but a succession of pitiful compromises with fate of concessions to old tradition old beliefs old charities and frailties that was what her act had taught her that was the word of the gods to the mortal who had laid a hand on their bolts and she had humbled herself to accept the lesson seeing human relations at last as a tangled and deeprooted growth a dark forest through which the idealist cannot cut his straight path without hearing at each stroke the cry of the severed branch why woundest thou me the lawns leading up to the house were already sprinkled with holidaymakers while along the avenue came the rolling of wheels the throb of motorcars and justine with cicely beside her stood in the wide hall to receive the incoming throng in which hanaford society was indiscriminately mingled with the operatives in their sunday best while his wife welcomed the new arrivals amherst supported by some young westmore cousins was guiding them into the concerthall where he was to say a word on the uses of the building before declaring it open for inspection and presently justine and cicely summoned by westy gaines made their way through the rows of seats to a corner near the platform her husband was there already with halford gaines and a group of hanaford dignitaries and just below them sat mrs gaines and her daughters the harry dressels and amhersts radiant mother as justine passed between them she wondered how much they knew of the events which had wrought so profound and permanent change in her life she had never known how hanaford explained her absence or what comments it had made on her return but she saw today more clearly than ever that amherst had become a power among his townsmen and that if they were still blind to the inner meaning of his work its practical results were beginning to impress them profoundly hanafords sociological creed was largely based on commercial considerations and amherst had won hanafords esteem by the novel feat of defying its economic principles and snatching success out of his defiance and now he had advanced a step or two in front of the representative semicircle on the platform and was beginning to speak justine did not hear his first words she was looking up at him trying to see him with the eyes of the crowd and wondering what manner of man he would have seemed to her if she had known as little as they did of his inner history he held himself straight the heavy locks thrown back from his forehead one hand resting on the table beside him the other grasping a folded blueprint which the architect of the building had just advanced to give him as he stood there justine recalled her first sight of him in the hope hospital five years earlier was it only five years they had dealt deep strokes to his face hollowing the eyesockets accentuating the strong modelling of nose and chin fixing the lines between the brows but every touch had a meaning it was not the languid hand of time which had remade his features but the sharp chisel of thought and action she roused herself suddenly to the consciousness of what he was saying for the idea of this building of a building dedicated to the recreation of westmore is not new in my mind but while it remained there as a mere idea it had already without my knowledge taken definite shape in the thoughts of the owner of westmore there was a slight drop in his voice as he designated bessy and he waited a moment before continuing it was not till after the death of my first wife that i learned of her intention that i found by accident among her papers this carefullystudied plan for a pleasurehouse at hopewood he paused again and unrolling the blueprint held it up before his audience you cannot at this distance he went on see all the admirable details of her plan see how beautifully they were imagined how carefully and intelligently elaborated she who conceived them longed to see beauty everywhere it was her dearest wish to bestow it on her people here and her ardent imagination outran the bounds of practical possibility we cannot give you in its completeness the beautiful thing she had imagined the great terraces the marble porches the fountains lilytanks and cloisters but you will see that wherever it was possible though in humbler materials and on a smaller scale we have faithfully followed her design and when presently you go through this building and when hereafter you find health and refreshment and diversion here i ask you to remember the beauty she dreamed of giving you and to let the thought of it make her memory beautiful among you and among your children justine had listened with deepening amazement she was seated so close to her husband that she had recognized the blueprint the moment he unrolled it there was no mistaking its origin it was simply the plan of the gymnasium which bessy had intended to build at lynbrook and which she had been constrained to abandon owing to her husbands increased expenditure at the mills but how was it possible that amherst knew nothing of the original purpose of the plans and by what mocking turn of events had a project devised in deliberate defiance of his wishes and intended to declare his wifes open contempt for them been transformed into a utopian vision for the betterment of the westmore operatives a wave of anger swept over justine at this last derisive stroke of fate it was grotesque and pitiable that a man like amherst should create out of his regrets a being who had never existed and then ascribe to her feelings and actions of which the real woman had again and again proved herself incapable ah no justine had suffered enough but to have this imaginary bessy called from the grave dressed in a semblance of selfdevotion and idealism to see her petty impulses of vindictiveness disguised as the motions of a lofty spirit it was as though her small malicious ghost had devised this way of punishing the wife who had taken her place justine had suffered enough suffered deliberately and unstintingly paying the full price of her error not seeking to evade its least consequence but no sane judgment could ask her to sit quiet under this last hallucination what this unreal woman this phantom that amhersts uneasy imagination had evoked was to come between himself and her to supplant her first as his wife and then as his fellowworker why should she not cry out the truth to him defend herself against the dead who came back to rob her of such wedded peace as was hers she had only to tell the true story of the plans to lay poor bessys ghost forever the confused throbbing impulses within her were stifled under a long burst of applause then she saw westy gaines at her side again and understood that he had come to lead cicely to the platform for a moment she clung jealously to the childs hand hardly aware of what she did feeling only that she was being thrust farther and farther into the background of the life she had helped to call out of chaos then a contrary impulse moved her she gently freed cicelys hand and a moment later as she sat with bent head and throbbing breast she heard the childs treble piping out above her in my mothers name i give this house to westmore applause again and then justine found herself enveloped in a general murmur of compliment and congratulation mr amherst had spoken admirably a beautiful tribute ah he had done poor bessy justice and to think that till now hanaford had never fully known how she had the welfare of the mills at heart how it was really only her work that he was carrying on there well he had made that perfectly clear and no doubt cicely was being taught to follow in her mothers footsteps everyone had noticed how her stepfather was associating her with the work at the mills and his little speech would as it were consecrate the childs relation to that work make it appear to her as the continuance of a beautiful a sacred tradition and now it was over the building had been inspected the operatives had dispersed the hanaford company had rolled off down the avenue cicely among them driving away tired and happy in mrs dressels victoria and amherst and his wife were alone amherst after bidding goodbye to his last guests had gone back to the empty concertroom to fetch the blueprint lying on the platform he came back with it between the uneven rows of empty chairs and joined justine who stood waiting in the hall his face was slightly flushed and his eyes had the light which in happy moments burned through their veil of thought he laid his hand on his wifes arm and drawing her toward a table spread out the blueprint before her you havent seen this have you he said she looked down at the plan without answering reading in the lefthand corner the architects conventional inscription swimmingtank and gymnasium designed for mrs john amherst amherst looked up perhaps struck by her silence but perhaps you have seen it at lynbrook it must have been done while you were there the quickened throb of her blood rushed to her brain like a signal speak speak now the signal commanded justine continued to look fixedly at the plan yes i have seen it she said at length at lynbrook at lynbrook she showed it to you i suppose while i was away justine hesitated again yes while you were away and did she tell you anything about it go into details about her wishes her intentions now was the moment now as her lips parted she looked up at her husband the illumination still lingered on his face and it was the face she loved he was waiting eagerly for her next word no i heard no details i merely saw the plan lying there she saw his look of disappointment she never told you about it no she never told me it was best so after all she understood that now it was now at last that she was paying her full price amherst rolled up the plan with a sigh and pushed it into the drawer of the table it struck her that he too had the look of one who has laid a ghost he turned to her and drew her hand through his arm youre tired dear you ought to have driven back with the others he said no i would rather stay with you you want to drain this good day to the dregs as i do yes she murmured drawing her hand away it is a good day isnt it he continued looking about him at the whitepanelled walls the vista of large bright rooms seen through the folding doors i feel as if we had reached a height somehow a height where one might pause and draw breath for the next climb dont you feel that too justine yes i feel it do you remember once long ago one day when you and i and cicely went on a picnic to hunt orchids how we got talking of the one best moment in life the moment when one wanted most to stop the clock the colour rose in her face while he spoke it was a long time since he had referred to the early days of their friendship the days before yes i remember she said and do you remember how we said that it was with most of us as it was with faust that the moment one wanted to hold fast to was not in most lives the moment of keenest personal happiness but the other kind the kind that would have seemed grey and colourless at first the moment when the meaning of life began to come out from the mists when one could look out at last over the marsh one had drained a tremor ran through justine it was you who said that she said halfsmiling but didnt you feel it with me dont you now yes i do now she murmured he came close to her and taking her hands in his kissed them one after the other dear he said let us go out and look at the marsh we have drained he turned and led her through the open doorway to the terrace above the river the sun was setting behind the wooded slopes of hopewood and the trees about the house stretched long blue shadows across the lawn beyond them rose the smoke of westmore
