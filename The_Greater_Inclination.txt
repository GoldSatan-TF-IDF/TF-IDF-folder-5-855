the greater inclination the greater inclination i the muses tragedy ii a journey iii the pelican iv souls belated v a coward vi the twilight of the god vii a cup of cold water viii the portrait the greater inclination the muses tragedy danyers afterwards liked to fancy that he had recognized mrs anerton at once but that of course was absurd since he had seen no portrait of her she affected a strict anonymity refusing even her photograph to the most privileged and from mrs memorall whom he revered and cultivated as her friend he had extracted but the one impressionist phrase oh well shes like one of those old prints where the lines have the value of color he was almost certain at all events that he had been thinking of mrs anerton as he sat over his breakfast in the empty hotel restaurant and that looking up on the approach of the lady who seated herself at the table near the window he had said to himself that might be she ever since his harvard days he was still young enough to think of them as immensely remote danyers had dreamed of mrs anerton the silvia of vincent rendles immortal sonnetcycle the mrs a of the life and letters her name was enshrined in some of the noblest english verse of the nineteenth century and of all past or future centuries as danyers from the standpoint of a maturer judgment still believed the first reading of certain poems of the antinous the pia tolomei the sonnets to silvia had been epochs in danyerss growth and the verse seemed to gain in mellowness in amplitude in meaning as one brought to its interpretation more experience of life a finer emotional sense where in his boyhood he had felt only the perfect the almost austere beauty of form the subtle interplay of vowelsounds the rush and fulness of lyric emotion he now thrilled to the closepacked significance of each line the allusiveness of each word his imagination lured hither and thither on fresh trails of thought and perpetually spurred by the sense that beyond what he had already discovered more marvellous regions lay waiting to be explored danyers had written at college the prize essay on rendles poetry it chanced to be the moment of the great mans death he had fashioned the fugitive verse of his own stormandstress period on the forms which rendle had first given to english metre and when two years later the life and letters appeared and the silvia of the sonnets took substance as mrs a he had included in his worship of rendle the woman who had inspired not only such divine verse but such playful tender incomparable prose danyers never forgot the day when mrs memorall happened to mention that she knew mrs anerton he had known mrs memorall for a year or more and had somewhat contemptuously classified her as the kind of woman who runs cheap excursions to celebrities when one afternoon she remarked as she put a second lump of sugar in his tea is it right this time youre almost as particular as mary anerton mary anerton yes i never can remember how she likes her tea either its lemon with sugar or lemon without sugar or cream without either and whichever it is must be put into the cup before the tea is poured in and if one hasnt remembered one must begin all over again i suppose it was vincent rendles way of taking his tea and has become a sacred rite do you know mrs anerton cried danyers disturbed by this careless familiarity with the habits of his divinity and did i once see shelley plain mercy yes she and i were at school together shes an american you know we were at a pension near tours for nearly a year then she went back to new york and i didnt see her again till after her marriage she and anerton spent a winter in rome while my husband was attached to our legation there and she used to be with us a great deal mrs memorall smiled reminiscently it was the winter the winter they first met precisely but unluckily i left rome just before the meeting took place wasnt it too bad i might have been in the life and letters you know he mentions that stupid madame vodki at whose house he first saw her and did you see much of her after that not during rendles life you know she has lived in europe almost entirely and though i used to see her off and on when i went abroad she was always so engrossed so preoccupied that one felt one wasnt wanted the fact is she cared only about his friends she separated herself gradually from all her own people now of course its different shes desperately lonely shes taken to writing to me now and then and last year when she heard i was going abroad she asked me to meet her in venice and i spent a week with her there and rendle mrs memorall smiled and shook her head oh i never was allowed a peep at him none of her old friends met him except by accident illnatured people say that was the reason she kept him so long if one happened in while he was there he was hustled into anertons study and the husband mounted guard till the inopportune visitor had departed anerton you know was really much more ridiculous about it than his wife mary was too clever to lose her head or at least to show shed lost it but anerton couldnt conceal his pride in the conquest ive seen mary shiver when he spoke of rendle as our poet rendle always had to have a certain seat at the dinnertable away from the draught and not too near the fire and a box of cigars that no one else was allowed to touch and a writingtable of his own in marys sittingroom and anerton was always telling one of the great mans idiosyncrasies how he never would cut the ends of his cigars though anerton himself had given him a gold cutter set with a starsapphire and how untidy his writingtable was and how the housemaid had orders always to bring the wastepaper basket to her mistress before emptying it lest some immortal verse should be thrown into the dustbin the anertons never separated did they separated bless you no he never would have left rendle and besides he was very fond of his wife and she oh she saw he was the kind of man who was fated to make himself ridiculous and she never interfered with his natural tendencies from mrs memorall danyers further learned that mrs anerton whose husband had died some years before her poet now divided her life between rome where she had a small apartment and england where she occasionally went to stay with those of her friends who had been rendles she had been engaged for some time after his death in editing some juvenilia which he had bequeathed to her care but that task being accomplished she had been left without definite occupation and mrs memorall on the occasion of their last meeting had found her listless and out of spirits she misses him too much her life is too empty i told her so i told her she ought to marry oh why not pray shes a young woman still what many people would call young mrs memorall interjected with a parenthetic glance at the mirror why not accept the inevitable and begin over again all the kings horses and all the kings men wont bring rendle to lifeand besides she didnt marry him when she had the chance danyers winced slightly at this rude fingering of his idol was it possible that mrs memorall did not see what an anticlimax such a marriage would have been fancy rendle making an honest woman of silvia for so society would have viewed it how such a reparation would have vulgarized their past it would have been like restoring a masterpiece and how exquisite must have been the perceptions of the woman who in defiance of appearances and perhaps of her own secret inclination chose to go down to posterity as silvia rather than as mrs vincent rendle mrs memorall from this day forth acquired an interest in danyerss eyes she was like a volume of unindexed and discursive memoirs through which he patiently plodded in the hope of finding embedded amid layers of dusty twaddle some precious allusion to the subject of his thought when some months later he brought out his first slim volume in which the remodelled college essay on rendle figured among a dozen somewhat overstudied appreciations he offered a copy to mrs memorall who surprised him the next time they met with the announcement that she had sent the book to mrs anerton mrs anerton in due time wrote to thank her friend danyers was privileged to read the few lines in which in terms that suggested the habit of acknowledging similar tributes she spoke of the authors feeling and insight and was so glad of the opportunity etc he went away disappointed without clearly knowing what else he had expected the following spring when he went abroad mrs memorall offered him letters to everybody from the archbishop of canterbury to louise michel she did not include mrs anerton however and danyers knew from a previous conversation that silvia objected to people who brought letters he knew also that she travelled during the summer and was unlikely to return to rome before the term of his holiday should be reached and the hope of meeting her was not included among his anticipations the lady whose entrance broke upon his solitary repast in the restaurant of the hotel villa deste had seated herself in such a way that her profile was detached against the window and thus viewed her domed forehead small arched nose and fastidious lip suggested a silhouette of marie antoinette in the ladys dress and movements in the very turn of her wrist as she poured out her coffee danyers thought he detected the same fastidiousness the same air of tacitly excluding the obvious and unexceptional here was a woman who had been much bored and keenly interested the waiter brought her a secolo and as she bent above it danyers noticed that the hair rolled back from her forehead was turning gray but her figure was straight and slender and she had the invaluable gift of a girlish back the rush of anglosaxon travel had not set toward the lakes and with the exception of an italian family or two and a humpbacked youth with an abb—Ä danyers and the lady had the marble halls of the villa deste to themselves when he returned from his morning ramble among the hills he saw her sitting at one of the little tables at the edge of the lake she was writing and a heap of books and newspapers lay on the table at her side that evening they met again in the garden he had strolled out to smoke a last cigarette before dinner and under the black vaulting of ilexes near the steps leading down to the boatlanding he found her leaning on the parapet above the lake at the sound of his approach she turned and looked at him she had thrown a black lace scarf over her head and in this sombre setting her face seemed thin and unhappy he remembered afterwards that her eyes as they met his expressed not so much sorrow as profound discontent to his surprise she stepped toward him with a detaining gesture mr lewis danyers i believe he bowed i am mrs anerton i saw your name on the visitors list and wished to thank you for an essay on mr rendles poetry or rather to tell you how much i appreciated it the book was sent to me last winter by mrs memorall she spoke in even melancholy tones as though the habit of perfunctory utterance had robbed her voice of more spontaneous accents but her smile was charming they sat down on a stone bench under the ilexes and she told him how much pleasure his essay had given her she thought it the best in the book she was sure he had put more of himself into it than into any other was she not right in conjecturing that he had been very deeply influenced by mr rendles poetry pour comprendre il faut aimer and it seemed to her that in some ways he had penetrated the poets inner meaning more completely than any other critic there were certain problems of course that he had left untouched certain aspects of that manysided mind that he had perhaps failed to seize but then you are young she concluded gently and one could not wish you as yet the experience that a fuller understanding would imply ii she stayed a month at villa deste and danyers was with her daily she showed an unaffected pleasure in his society a pleasure so obviously founded on their common veneration of rendle that the young man could enjoy it without fear of fatuity at first he was merely one more grain of frankincense on the altar of her insatiable divinity but gradually a more personal note crept into their intercourse if she still liked him only because he appreciated rendle she at least perceptibly distinguished him from the herd of rendles appreciators her attitude toward the great mans memory struck danyers as perfect she neither proclaimed nor disavowed her identity she was frankly silvia to those who knew and cared but there was no trace of the egeria in her pose she spoke often of rendles books but seldom of himself there was no posthumous conjugality no use of the possessive tense in her abounding reminiscences of the masters intellectual life of his habits of thought and work she never wearied of talking she knew the history of each poem by what scene or episode each image had been evoked how many times the words in a certain line had been transposed how long a certain adjective had been sought and what had at last suggested it she could even explain that one impenetrable line the torment of critics the joy of detractors the last line of the old odysseus danyers felt that in talking of these things she was no mere echo of rendles thought if her identity had appeared to be merged in his it was because they thought alike not because he had thought for her posterity is apt to regard the women whom poets have sung as chance pegs on which they hung their garlands but mrs anertons mind was like some fertile garden wherein inevitably rendles imagination had rooted itself and flowered danyers began to see how many threads of his complex mental tissue the poet had owed to the blending of her temperament with his in a certain sense silvia had herself created the sonnets to silvia to be the custodian of rendles inner self the door as it were to the sanctuary had at first seemed to danyers so comprehensive a privilege that he had the sense as his friendship with mrs anerton advanced of forcing his way into a life already crowded what room was there among such towering memories for so small an actuality as his quite suddenly after this he discovered that mrs memorall knew better his fortunate friend was bored as well as lonely you have had more than any other woman he had exclaimed to her one day and her smile flashed a derisive light on his blunder fool that he was not to have seen that she had not had enough that she was young still do years count tender human a woman that the living have need of the living after that when they climbed the alleys of the hanging park resting in one of the little ruined temples or watching through a ripple of foliage the remote blue flash of the lake they did not always talk of rendle or of literature she encouraged danyers to speak of himself to confide his ambitions to her she asked him the questions which are the wise womans substitute for advice you must write she said administering the most exquisite flattery that human lips could give of course he meant to write why not to do something great in his turn his best at least with the resolve at the outset that his best should be the best nothing less seemed possible with that mandate in his ears how she had divined him lifted and disentangled his groping ambitions laid the awakening touch on his spirit with her creative let there be light it was his last day with her and he was feeling very hopeless and happy you ought to write a book about him she went on gently danyers started he was beginning to dislike rendles way of walking in unannounced you ought to do it she insisted a complete interpretation a summingup of his style his purpose his theory of life and art no one else could do it as well he sat looking at her perplexedly suddenly dared he guess i couldnt do it without you he faltered i could help you i would help you of course they sat silent both looking at the lake it was agreed when they parted that he should rejoin her six weeks later in venice there they were to talk about the book iii lago diseo august th when i said goodby to you yesterday i promised to come back to venice in a week i was to give you your answer then i was not honest in saying that i didnt mean to go back to venice or to see you again i was running away from you and i mean to keep on running if you wont i must somebody must save you from marrying a disappointed woman of well you say years dont count and why should they after all since you are not to marry me that is what i dare not go back to say you are not to marry me we have had our month together in venice such a good month was it not and now you are to go home and write a book any book but the one we didnt talk of and i am to stay here attitudinizing among my memories like a sort of female tithonus the dreariness of this enforced immortality but you shall know the truth i care for you or at least for your love enough to owe you that you thought it was because vincent rendle had loved me that there was so little hope for you i had had what i wanted to the full wasnt that what you said it is just when a man begins to think he understands a woman that he may be sure he doesnt it is because vincent rendle didnt love me that there is no hope for you i never had what i wanted and never never never will i stoop to wanting anything else do you begin to understand it was all a sham then you say no it was all real as far as it went you are young you havent learned as you will later the thousand imperceptible signs by which one gropes ones way through the labyrinth of human nature but didnt it strike you sometimes that i never told you any foolish little anecdotes about him his trick for instance of twirling a paperknife round and round between his thumb and forefinger while he talked his mania for saving the backs of notes his greediness for wild strawberries the little pungent alpine ones his childish delight in acrobats and jugglers his way of always calling me you dear you every letter began i never told you a word of all that did i do you suppose i could have helped telling you if he had loved me these little things would have been mine then a part of my life of our life they would have slipped out in spite of me its only your unhappy woman who is always reticent and dignified but there never was any our life it was always our lives to the end if you knew what a relief it is to tell some one at last you would bear with me you would let me hurt you i shall never be quite so lonely again now that some one knows let me begin at the beginning when i first met vincent rendle i was not twentyfive that was twenty years ago from that time until his death five years ago we were fast friends he gave me fifteen years perhaps the best fifteen years of his life the world as you know thinks that his greatest poems were written during those years i am supposed to have inspired them and in a sense i did from the first the intellectual sympathy between us was almost complete my mind must have been to him i fancy like some perfectly tuned instrument on which he was never tired of playing some one told me of his once saying of me that i always understood it is the only praise i ever heard of his giving me i dont even know if he thought me pretty though i hardly think my appearance could have been disagreeable to him for he hated to be with ugly people at all events he fell into the way of spending more and more of his time with me he liked our house our ways suited him he was nervous irritable people bored him and yet he disliked solitude he took sanctuary with us when we travelled he went with us in the winter he took rooms near us in rome in england or on the continent he was always with us for a good part of the year in small ways i was able to help him in his work he grew dependent on me when we were apart he wrote to me continually he liked to have me share in all he was doing or thinking he was impatient for my criticism of every new book that interested him i was a part of his intellectual life the pity of it was that i wanted to be something more i was a young woman and i was in love with him not because he was vincent rendle but just because he was himself people began to talk of course i was vincent rendles mrs anerton when the sonnets to silvia appeared it was whispered that i was silvia wherever he went i was invited people made up to me in the hope of getting to know him when i was in london my doorbell never stopped ringing elderly peeresses aspiring hostesses lovesick girls and struggling authors overwhelmed me with their assiduities i hugged my success for i knew what it meant they thought that rendle was in love with me do you know at times they almost made me think so too oh there was no phase of folly i didnt go through you cant imagine the excuses a woman will invent for a mans not telling her that he loves her pitiable arguments that she would see through at a glance if any other woman used them but all the while deep down i knew he had never cared i should have known it if he had made love to me every day of his life i could never guess whether he knew what people said about us he listened so little to what people said and cared still less when he heard he was always quite honest and straightforward with me he treated me as one man treats another and yet at times i felt he must see that with me it was different if he did see he made no sign perhaps he never noticed i am sure he never meant to be cruel he had never made love to me it was no fault of his if i wanted more than he could give me the sonnets to silvia you say but what are they a cosmic philosophy not a lovepoem addressed to woman not to a woman but then the letters ah the letters well ill make a clean breast of it you have noticed the breaks in the letters here and there just as they seem to be on the point of growing a little warmer the critics you may remember praised the editor for his commendable delicacy and good taste so rare in these days in omitting from the correspondence all personal allusions all those d—Ätails intimes which should be kept sacred from the public gaze they referred of course to the asterisks in the letters to mrs a those letters i myself prepared for publication that is to say i copied them out for the editor and every now and then i put in a line of asterisks to make it appear that something had been left out you understand the asterisks were a sham there was nothing to leave out no one but a woman could understand what i went through during those years the moments of revolt when i felt i must break away from it all fling the truth in his face and never see him again the inevitable reaction when not to see him seemed the one unendurable thing and i trembled lest a look or word of mine should disturb the poise of our friendship the silly days when i hugged the delusion that he must love me since everybody thought he did the long periods of numbness when i didnt seem to care whether he loved me or not between these wretched days came others when our intellectual accord was so perfect that i forgot everything else in the joy of feeling myself lifted up on the wings of his thought sometimes then the heavens seemed to be opened all this time he was so dear a friend he had the genius of friendship and he spent it all on me yes you were right when you said that i have had more than any other woman il faut de ladresse pour aimer pascal says and i was so quiet so cheerful so frankly affectionate with him that in all those years i am almost sure i never bored him could i have hoped as much if he had loved me you mustnt think of him though as having been tied to my skirts he came and went as he pleased and so did his fancies there was a girl once i am telling you everything a lovely being who called his poetry deep and gave him lucile on his birthday he followed her to switzerland one summer and all the time that he was dangling after her a little too conspicuously i always thought for a great man he was writing to me about his theory of vowelcombinations or was it his experiments in english hexameter the letters were dated from the very places where i knew they went and sat by waterfalls together and he thought out adjectives for her hair he talked to me about it quite frankly afterwards she was perfectly beautiful and it had been a pure delight to watch her but she would talk and her mind he said was all elbows and yet the next year when her marriage was announced he went away alone quite suddenly and it was just afterwards that he published loves viaticum men are queer after my husband died i am putting things crudely you see i had a return of hope it was because he loved me i argued that he had never spoken because he had always hoped some day to make me his wife because he wanted to spare me the reproach rubbish i knew well enough in my heart of hearts that my one chance lay in the force of habit he had grown used to me he was no longer young he dreaded new people and new ways il avait pris son pli would it not be easier to marry me i dont believe he ever thought of it he wrote me what people call a beautiful letter he was kind considerate decently commiserating then after a few weeks he slipped into his old way of coming in every afternoon and our interminable talks began again just where they had left off i heard later that people thought i had shown such good taste in not marrying him so we jogged on for five years longer perhaps they were the best years for i had given up hoping then he died after his death this is curious there came to me a kind of mirage of love all the books and articles written about him all the reviews of the life were full of discreet allusions to silvia i became again the mrs anerton of the glorious days sentimental girls and dear lads like you turned pink when somebody whispered that was silvia you were talking to idiots begged for my autograph publishers urged me to write my reminiscences of him critics consulted me about the reading of doubtful lines and i knew that to all these people i was the woman vincent rendle had loved after a while that fire went out too and i was left alone with my past alone quite alone for he had never really been with me the intellectual union counted for nothing now it had been soul to soul but never hand in hand and there were no little things to remember him by then there set in a kind of arctic winter i crawled into myself as into a snowhut i hated my solitude and yet dreaded any one who disturbed it that phase of course passed like the others i took up life again and began to read the papers and consider the cut of my gowns but there was one question that i could not be rid of that haunted me night and day why had he never loved me why had i been so much to him and no more was i so ugly so essentially unlovable that though a man might cherish me as his minds comrade he could not care for me as a woman i cant tell you how that question tortured me it became an obsession my poor friend do you begin to see i had to find out what some other man thought of me dont be too hard on me listen first consider when i first met vincent rendle i was a young woman who had married early and led the quietest kind of life i had had no experiences from the hour of our first meeting to the day of his death i never looked at any other man and never noticed whether any other man looked at me when he died five years ago i knew the extent of my powers no more than a baby was it too late to find out should i never know why forgive me forgive me you are so young it will be an episode a mere document to you so soon and besides it wasnt as deliberate as coldblooded as these disjointed lines have made it appear i didnt plan it like a woman in a book life is so much more complex than any rendering of it can be i liked you from the first i was drawn to you you must have seen that i wanted you to like me it was not a mere psychological experiment and yet in a sense it was that too i must be honest i had to have an answer to that question it was a ghost that had to be laid at first i was afraid oh so much afraid that you cared for me only because i was silvia that you loved me because you thought rendle had loved me i began to think there was no escaping my destiny how happy i was when i discovered that you were growing jealous of my past that you actually hated rendle my heart beat like a girls when you told me you meant to follow me to venice after our parting at villa deste my old doubts reasserted themselves what did i know of your feeling for me after all were you capable of analyzing it yourself was it not likely to be twothirds vanity and curiosity and onethird literary sentimentality you might easily fancy that you cared for mary anerton when you were really in love with silvia the heart is such a hypocrite or you might be more calculating than i had supposed perhaps it was you who had been flattering my vanity in the hope the pardonable hope of turning me after a decent interval into a pretty little essay with a margin when you arrived in venice and we met again do you remember the music on the lagoon that evening from my balcony i was so afraid you would begin to talk about the book the book you remember was your ostensible reason for coming you never spoke of it and i soon saw your one fear was i might do so might remind you of your object in being with me then i knew you cared for me yes at that moment really cared we never mentioned the book once did we during that month in venice i have read my letter over and now i wish that i had said this to you instead of writing it i could have felt my way then watching your face and seeing if you understood but no i could not go back to venice and i could not tell you though i tried while we were there together i couldnt spoil that month my one month it was so good for once in my life to get away from literature you will be angry with me at first but alas not for long what i have done would have been cruel if i had been a younger woman as it is the experiment will hurt no one but myself and it will hurt me horribly as much as in your first anger you may perhaps wish because it has shown me for the first time all that i have missed a journey as she lay in her berth staring at the shadows overhead the rush of the wheels was in her brain driving her deeper and deeper into circles of wakeful lucidity the sleepingcar had sunk into its nightsilence through the wet windowpane she watched the sudden lights the long stretches of hurrying blackness now and then she turned her head and looked through the opening in the hangings at her husbands curtains across the aisle she wondered restlessly if he wanted anything and if she could hear him if he called his voice had grown very weak within the last months and it irritated him when she did not hear this irritability this increasing childish petulance seemed to give expression to their imperceptible estrangement like two faces looking at one another through a sheet of glass they were close together almost touching but they could not hear or feel each other the conductivity between them was broken she at least had this sense of separation and she fancied sometimes that she saw it reflected in the look with which he supplemented his failing words doubtless the fault was hers she was too impenetrably healthy to be touched by the irrelevancies of disease her selfreproachful tenderness was tinged with the sense of his irrationality she had a vague feeling that there was a purpose in his helpless tyrannies the suddenness of the change had found her so unprepared a year ago their pulses had beat to one robust measure both had the same prodigal confidence in an exhaustless future now their energies no longer kept step hers still bounded ahead of life pre—Ämpting unclaimed regions of hope and activity while his lagged behind vainly struggling to overtake her when they married she had such arrears of living to make up her days had been as bare as the whitewashed schoolroom where she forced innutritious facts upon reluctant children his coming had broken in on the slumber of circumstance widening the present till it became the encloser of remotest chances but imperceptibly the horizon narrowed life had a grudge against her she was never to be allowed to spread her wings at first the doctors had said that six weeks of mild air would set him right but when he came back this assurance was explained as having of course included a winter in a dry climate they gave up their pretty house storing the wedding presents and new furniture and went to colorado she had hated it there from the first nobody knew her or cared about her there was no one to wonder at the good match she had made or to envy her the new dresses and the visitingcards which were still a surprise to her and he kept growing worse she felt herself beset with difficulties too evasive to be fought by so direct a temperament she still loved him of course but he was gradually undefinably ceasing to be himself the man she had married had been strong active gently masterful the male whose pleasure it is to clear a way through the material obstructions of life but now it was she who was the protector he who must be shielded from importunities and given his drops or his beefjuice though the skies were falling the routine of the sickroom bewildered her this punctual administering of medicine seemed as idle as some uncomprehended religious mummery there were moments indeed when warm gushes of pity swept away her instinctive resentment of his condition when she still found his old self in his eyes as they groped for each other through the dense medium of his weakness but these moments had grown rare sometimes he frightened her his sunken expressionless face seemed that of a stranger his voice was weak and hoarse his thinlipped smile a mere muscular contraction her hand avoided his damp soft skin which had lost the familiar roughness of health she caught herself furtively watching him as she might have watched a strange animal it frightened her to feel that this was the man she loved there were hours when to tell him what she suffered seemed the one escape from her fears but in general she judged herself more leniently reflecting that she had perhaps been too long alone with him and that she would feel differently when they were at home again surrounded by her robust and buoyant family how she had rejoiced when the doctors at last gave their consent to his going home she knew of course what the decision meant they both knew it meant that he was to die but they dressed the truth in hopeful euphuisms and at times in the joy of preparation she really forgot the purpose of their journey and slipped into an eager allusion to next years plans at last the day of leaving came she had a dreadful fear that they would never get away that somehow at the last moment he would fail her that the doctors held one of their accustomed treacheries in reserve but nothing happened they drove to the station he was installed in a seat with a rug over his knees and a cushion at his back and she hung out of the window waving unregretful farewells to the acquaintances she had really never liked till then the first twentyfour hours had passed off well he revived a little and it amused him to look out of the window and to observe the humours of the car the second day he began to grow weary and to chafe under the dispassionate stare of the freckled child with the lump of chewinggum she had to explain to the childs mother that her husband was too ill to be disturbed a statement received by that lady with a resentment visibly supported by the maternal sentiment of the whole car that night he slept badly and the next morning his temperature frightened her she was sure he was growing worse the day passed slowly punctuated by the small irritations of travel watching his tired face she traced in its contractions every rattle and jolt of the tram till her own body vibrated with sympathetic fatigue she felt the others observing him too and hovered restlessly between him and the line of interrogative eyes the freckled child hung about him like a fly offers of candy and picturebooks failed to dislodge her she twisted one leg around the other and watched him imperturbably the porter as he passed lingered with vague proffers of help probably inspired by philanthropic passengers swelling with the sense that something ought to be done and one nervous man in a skullcap was audibly concerned as to the possible effect on his wifes health the hours dragged on in a dreary inoccupation towards dusk she sat down beside him and he laid his hand on hers the touch startled her he seemed to be calling her from far off she looked at him helplessly and his smile went through her like a physical pang are you very tired she asked no not very well be there soon now yes very soon this time tomorrow he nodded and they sat silent when she had put him to bed and crawled into her own berth she tried to cheer herself with the thought that in less than twentyfour hours they would be in new york her people would all be at the station to meet her she pictured their round unanxious faces pressing through the crowd she only hoped they would not tell him too loudly that he was looking splendidly and would be all right in no time the subtler sympathies developed by long contact with suffering were making her aware of a certain coarseness of texture in the family sensibilities suddenly she thought she heard him call she parted the curtains and listened no it was only a man snoring at the other end of the car his snores had a greasy sound as though they passed through tallow she lay down and tried to sleep had she not heard him move she started up trembling the silence frightened her more than any sound he might not be able to make her hear he might be calling her now what made her think of such things it was merely the familiar tendency of an overtired mind to fasten itself on the most intolerable chance within the range of its forebodings putting her head out she listened but she could not distinguish his breathing from that of the other pairs of lungs about her she longed to get up and look at him but she knew the impulse was a mere vent for her restlessness and the fear of disturbing him restrained her the regular movement of his curtain reassured her she knew not why she remembered that he had wished her a cheerful goodnight and the sheer inability to endure her fears a moment longer made her put them from her with an effort of her whole sound tired body she turned on her side and slept she sat up stiffly staring out at the dawn the train was rushing through a region of bare hillocks huddled against a lifeless sky it looked like the first day of creation the air of the car was close and she pushed up her window to let in the keen wind then she looked at her watch it was seven oclock and soon the people about her would be stirring she slipped into her clothes smoothed her dishevelled hair and crept to the dressingroom when she had washed her face and adjusted her dress she felt more hopeful it was always a struggle for her not to be cheerful in the morning her cheeks burned deliciously under the coarse towel and the wet hair about her temples broke into strong upward tendrils every inch of her was full of life and elasticity and in ten hours they would be at home she stepped to her husbands berth it was time for him to take his early glass of milk the windowshade was down and in the dusk of the curtained enclosure she could just see that he lay sideways with his face away from her she leaned over him and drew up the shade as she did so she touched one of his hands it felt cold she bent closer laying her hand on his arm and calling him by name he did not move she spoke again more loudly she grasped his shoulder and gently shook it he lay motionless she caught hold of his hand again it slipped from her limply like a dead thing a dead thing her breath caught she must see his face she leaned forward and hurriedly shrinkingly with a sickening reluctance of the flesh laid her hands on his shoulders and turned him over his head fell back his face looked small and smooth he gazed at her with steady eyes she remained motionless for a long time holding him thus and they looked at each other suddenly she shrank back the longing to scream to call out to fly from him had almost overpowered her but a strong hand arrested her good god if it were known that he was dead they would be put off the train at the next station in a terrifying flash of remembrance there arose before her a scene she had once witnessed in travelling when a husband and wife whose child had died in the train had been thrust out at some chance station she saw them standing on the platform with the childs body between them she had never forgotten the dazed look with which they followed the receding train and this was what would happen to her within the next hour she might find herself on the platform of some strange station alone with her husbands body anything but that it was too horrible she quivered like a creature at bay as she cowered there she felt the train moving more slowly it was coming then they were approaching a station she saw again the husband and wife standing on the lonely platform and with a violent gesture she drew down the shade to hide her husbands face feeling dizzy she sank down on the edge of the berth keeping away from his outstretched body and pulling the curtains close so that he and she were shut into a kind of sepulchral twilight she tried to think at all costs she must conceal the fact that he was dead but how her mind refused to act she could not plan combine she could think of no way but to sit there clutching the curtains all day long she heard the porter making up her bed people were beginning to move about the car the dressingroom door was being opened and shut she tried to rouse herself at length with a supreme effort she rose to her feet stepping into the aisle of the car and drawing the curtains tight behind her she noticed that they still parted slightly with the motion of the car and finding a pin in her dress she fastened them together now she was safe she looked round and saw the porter she fancied he was watching her aint he awake yet he enquired no she faltered i got his milk all ready when he wants it you know you told me to have it for him by seven she nodded silently and crept into her seat at halfpast eight the train reached buffalo by this time the other passengers were dressed and the berths had been folded back for the day the porter moving to and fro under his burden of sheets and pillows glanced at her as he passed at length he said aint he going to get up you know were ordered to make up the berths as early as we can she turned cold with fear they were just entering the station oh not yet she stammered not till hes had his milk wont you get it please all right soon as we start again when the train moved on he reappeared with the milk she took it from him and sat vaguely looking at it her brain moved slowly from one idea to another as though they were steppingstones set far apart across a whirling flood at length she became aware that the porter still hovered expectantly will i give it to him he suggested oh no she cried rising he hes asleep yet i think she waited till the porter had passed on then she unpinned the curtains and slipped behind them in the semiobscurity her husbands face stared up at her like a marble mask with agate eyes the eyes were dreadful she put out her hand and drew down the lids then she remembered the glass of milk in her other hand what was she to do with it she thought of raising the window and throwing it out but to do so she would have to lean across his body and bring her face close to his she decided to drink the milk she returned to her seat with the empty glass and after a while the porter came back to get it whenll i fold up his bed he asked oh not now not yet hes ill hes very ill cant you let him stay as he is the doctor wants him to lie down as much as possible he scratched his head well if hes really sick he took the empty glass and walked away explaining to the passengers that the party behind the curtains was too sick to get up just yet she found herself the centre of sympathetic eyes a motherly woman with an intimate smile sat down beside her im real sorry to hear your husbands sick ive had a remarkable amount of sickness in my family and maybe i could assist you can i take a look at him oh no no please he mustnt be disturbed the lady accepted the rebuff indulgently well its just as you say of course but you dont look to me as if youd had much experience in sickness and id have been glad to assist you what do you generally do when your husbands taken this way i i let him sleep too much sleep aint any too healthful either dont you give him any medicine y yes dont you wake him to take it yes when does he take the next dose not for two hours the lady looked disappointed well if i was you id try giving it oftener thats what i do with my folks after that many faces seemed to press upon her the passengers were on their way to the diningcar and she was conscious that as they passed down the aisle they glanced curiously at the closed curtains one lanternjawed man with prominent eyes stood still and tried to shoot his projecting glance through the division between the folds the freckled child returning from breakfast waylaid the passers with a buttery clutch saying in a loud whisper hes sick and once the conductor came by asking for tickets she shrank into her corner and looked out of the window at the flying trees and houses meaningless hieroglyphs of an endlessly unrolled papyrus now and then the train stopped and the newcomers on entering the car stared in turn at the closed curtains more and more people seemed to pass their faces began to blend fantastically with the images surging in her brain later in the day a fat man detached himself from the mist of faces he had a creased stomach and soft pale lips as he pressed himself into the seat facing her she noticed that he was dressed in black broadcloth with a soiled white tie husbands pretty bad this morning is he yes dear dear now thats terribly distressing aint it an apostolic smile revealed his goldfilled teeth of course you know theres no sech thing as sickness aint that a lovely thought death itself is but a deloosion of our grosser senses ony lay yourself open to the influx of the sperrit submit yourself passively to the action of the divine force and disease and dissolution will cease to exist for you if you could indooce your husband to read this little pamphlet the faces about her again grew indistinct she had a vague recollection of hearing the motherly lady and the parent of the freckled child ardently disputing the relative advantages of trying several medicines at once or of taking each in turn the motherly lady maintaining that the competitive system saved time the other objecting that you couldnt tell which remedy had effected the cure their voices went on and on like bellbuoys droning through a fog the porter came up now and then with questions that she did not understand but that somehow she must have answered since he went away again without repeating them every two hours the motherly lady reminded her that her husband ought to have his drops people left the car and others replaced them her head was spinning and she tried to steady herself by clutching at her thoughts as they swept by but they slipped away from her like bushes on the side of a sheer precipice down which she seemed to be falling suddenly her mind grew clear again and she found herself vividly picturing what would happen when the train reached new york she shuddered as it occurred to her that he would be quite cold and that some one might perceive he had been dead since morning she thought hurriedly if they see i am not surprised they will suspect something they will ask questions and if i tell them the truth they wont believe me no one would believe me it will be terrible and she kept repeating to herself i must pretend i dont know i must pretend i dont know when they open the curtains i must go up to him quite naturally and then i must scream she had an idea that the scream would be very hard to do gradually new thoughts crowded upon her vivid and urgent she tried to separate and restrain them but they beset her clamorously like her schoolchildren at the end of a hot day when she was too tired to silence them her head grew confused and she felt a sick fear of forgetting her part of betraying herself by some unguarded word or look i must pretend i dont know she went on murmuring the words had lost their significance but she repeated them mechanically as though they had been a magic formula until suddenly she heard herself saying i cant remember i cant remember her voice sounded very loud and she looked about her in terror but no one seemed to notice that she had spoken as she glanced down the car her eye caught the curtains of her husbands berth and she began to examine the monotonous arabesques woven through their heavy folds the pattern was intricate and difficult to trace she gazed fixedly at the curtains and as she did so the thick stuff grew transparent and through it she saw her husbands face his dead face she struggled to avert her look but her eyes refused to move and her head seemed to be held in a vice at last with an effort that left her weak and shaking she turned away but it was of no use close in front of her small and smooth was her husbands face it seemed to be suspended in the air between her and the false braids of the woman who sat in front of her with an uncontrollable gesture she stretched out her hand to push the face away and suddenly she felt the touch of his smooth skin she repressed a cry and half started from her seat the woman with the false braids looked around and feeling that she must justify her movement in some way she rose and lifted her travellingbag from the opposite seat she unlocked the bag and looked into it but the first object her hand met was a small flask of her husbands thrust there at the last moment in the haste of departure she locked the bag and closed her eyes his face was there again hanging between her eyeballs and lids like a waxen mask against a red curtain she roused herself with a shiver had she fainted or slept hours seemed to have elapsed but it was still broad day and the people about her were sitting in the same attitudes as before a sudden sense of hunger made her aware that she had eaten nothing since morning the thought of food filled her with disgust but she dreaded a return of faintness and remembering that she had some biscuits in her bag she took one out and ate it the dry crumbs choked her and she hastily swallowed a little brandy from her husbands flask the burning sensation in her throat acted as a counterirritant momentarily relieving the dull ache of her nerves then she felt a gentlystealing warmth as though a soft air fanned her and the swarming fears relaxed their clutch receding through the stillness that enclosed her a stillness soothing as the spacious quietude of a summer day she slept through her sleep she felt the impetuous rush of the train it seemed to be life itself that was sweeping her on with headlong inexorable force sweeping her into darkness and terror and the awe of unknown days now all at once everything was still not a sound not a pulsation she was dead in her turn and lay beside him with smooth upstaring face how quiet it was and yet she heard feet coming the feet of the men who were to carry them away she could feel too she felt a sudden prolonged vibration a series of hard shocks and then another plunge into darkness the darkness of death this time a black whirlwind on which they were both spinning like leaves in wild uncoiling spirals with millions and millions of the dead she sprang up in terror her sleep must have lasted a long time for the winter day had paled and the lights had been lit the car was in confusion and as she regained her selfpossession she saw that the passengers were gathering up their wraps and bags the woman with the false braids had brought from the dressingroom a sickly ivyplant in a bottle and the christian scientist was reversing his cuffs the porter passed down the aisle with his impartial brush an impersonal figure with a goldbanded cap asked for her husbands ticket a voice shouted baiggage express and she heard the clicking of metal as the passengers handed over their checks presently her window was blocked by an expanse of sooty wall and the train passed into the harlem tunnel the journey was over in a few minutes she would see her family pushing their joyous way through the throng at the station her heart dilated the worst terror was past wed better get him up now hadnt we asked the porter touching her arm he had her husbands hat in his hand and was meditatively revolving it under his brush she looked at the hat and tried to speak but suddenly the car grew dark she flung up her arms struggling to catch at something and fell face downward striking her head against the dead mans berth the pelican she was very pretty when i first knew her with the sweet straight nose and short upper lip of the cameobrooch divinity humanized by a dimple that flowered in her cheek whenever anything was said possessing the outward attributes of humor without its intrinsic quality for the dear lady was providentially deficient in humor the least hint of the real thing clouded her lovely eye like the hovering shadow of an algebraic problem i dont think nature had meant her to be intellectual but what can a poor thing do whose husband has died of drink when her baby is hardly six months old and who finds her coral necklace and her grandfathers edition of the british dramatists inadequate to the demands of the creditors her mother the celebrated irene astarte pratt had written a poem in blank verse on the fall of man one of her aunts was dean of a girls college another had translated euripides with such a family the poor childs fate was sealed in advance the only way of paying her husbands debts and keeping the baby clothed was to be intellectual and after some hesitation as to the form her mental activity was to take it was unanimously decided that she was to give lectures they began by being drawingroom lectures the first time i saw her she was standing by the piano against a flippant background of dresden china and photographs telling a roomful of women preoccupied with their spring bonnets all she thought she knew about greek art the ladies assembled to hear her had given me to understand that she was doing it for the baby and this fact together with the shortness of her upper lip and the bewildering cooperation of her dimple disposed me to listen leniently to her dissertation happily at that time greek art was still if i may use the phrase easily handled it was as simple as walking down a museumgallery lined with pleasant familiar venuses and apollos all the later complications the archaic and archaistic conundrums the influences of assyria and asia minor the conflicting attributions and the wrangles of the erudite still slumbered in the bosom of the future scientific critic greek art in those days began with phidias and ended with the apollo belvedere and a child could travel from one to the other without danger of losing his way mrs amyot had two fatal gifts a capacious but inaccurate memory and an extraordinary fluency of speech there was nothing she did not remember wrongly but her halting facts were swathed in so many layers of rhetoric that their infirmities were imperceptible to her friendly critics besides she had been taught greek by the aunt who had translated euripides and the mere sound of the greek ais and greek ois that she now and then not unskilfully let slip correcting herself of course with a start and indulgently mistranslating the phrase struck awe to the hearts of ladies whose only accomplishment was french if you didnt speak too quickly i had then but a momentary glimpse of mrs amyot but a few months later i came upon her again in the new england university town where the celebrated irene astarte pratt lived on the summit of a local parnassus with lesser muses and college professors respectfully grouped on the lower ledges of the sacred declivity mrs amyot who after her husbands death had returned to the maternal roof even during her fathers lifetime the roof had been distinctively maternal mrs amyot thanks to her upper lip her dimple and her greek was already esconced in a snug hollow of the parnassian slope after the lecture was over it happened that i walked home with mrs amyot from the incensed glances of two or three learned gentlemen who were hovering on the doorstep when we emerged i inferred that mrs amyot at that period did not often walk home alone but i doubt whether any of my discomfited rivals whatever his claims to favor was ever treated to so ravishing a mixture of shyness and selfabandonment of sham erudition and real teeth and hair as it was my privilege to enjoy even at the opening of her public career mrs amyot had a tender eye for strangers as possible links with successive centres of culture to which in due course the torch of greek art might be handed on she began by telling me that she had never been so frightened in her life she knew of course how dreadfully learned i was and when just as she was going to begin her hostess had whispered to her that i was in the room she had felt ready to sink through the floor then with a flying dimple she had remembered emersons line wasnt it emersons that beauty is its own excuse for seeing and that had made her feel a little more confident since she was sure that no one saw beauty more vividly than she as a child she used to sit for hours gazing at an etruscan vase on the bookcase in the library while her sisters played with their dolls and if seeing beauty was the only excuse one needed for talking about it why she was sure i would make allowances and not be too critical and sarcastic especially if as she thought probable i had heard of her having lost her poor husband and how she had to do it for the baby being abundantly assured of my sympathy on these points she went on to say that she had always wanted so much to consult me about her lectures of course one subject wasnt enough this view of the limitations of greek art as a subject gave me a startling idea of the rate at which a successful lecturer might exhaust the universe she must find others she had not ventured on any as yet but she had thought of tennyson didnt i love tennyson she worshipped him so that she was sure she could help others to understand him or what did i think of a course on raphael or michelangelo or on the heroines of shakespeare there were some fine steelengravings of raphaels madonnas and of the sistine ceiling in her mothers library and she had seen miss cushman in several shakespearian r—Åles so that on these subjects also she felt qualified to speak with authority when we reached her mothers door she begged me to come in and talk the matter over she wanted me to see the baby she felt as though i should understand her better if i saw the baby and the dimple flashed through a tear the fear of encountering the author of the fall of man combined with the opportune recollection of a dinner engagement made me evade this appeal with the promise of returning on the morrow on the morrow i left too early to redeem my promise and for several years afterwards i saw no more of mrs amyot my calling at that time took me at irregular intervals from one to another of our larger cities and as mrs amyot was also peripatetic it was inevitable that sooner or later we should cross each others path it was therefore without surprise that one snowy afternoon in boston i learned from the lady with whom i chanced to be lunching that as soon as the meal was over i was to be taken to hear mrs amyot lecture on greek art i suggested oh youve heard her then no this is one of the series called homes and haunts of the poets last week we had wordsworth and the lake poets today we are to have goethe and weimar she is a wonderful creature all the women of her family are geniuses you know of course that her mother was irene astarte pratt who wrote a poem on the fall of man np willis called her the female milton of america one of mrs amyots aunts has translated eurip and is she as pretty as ever i irrelevantly interposed my hostess looked shocked she is excessively modest and retiring she says it is actual suffering for her to speak in public you know she only does it for the baby punctually at the hour appointed we took our seats in a lecturehall full of strenuous females in ulsters mrs amyot was evidently a favorite with these austere sisters for every corner was crowded and as we entered a pale usher with an educated mispronunciation was setting forth to several dejected applicants the impossibility of supplying them with seats our own were happily so near the front that when the curtains at the back of the platform parted and mrs amyot appeared i was at once able to establish a comparison between the lady placidly dimpling to the applause of her public and the shrinking drawingroom orator of my earlier recollections mrs amyot was as pretty as ever and there was the same curious discrepancy between the freshness of her aspect and the stateness of her theme but something was gone of the blushing unsteadiness with which she had fired her first random shots at greek art it was not that the shots were less uncertain but that she now had an air of assuming that for her purpose the bullseye was everywhere so that there was no need to be flustered in taking aim this assurance had so facilitated the flow of her eloquence that she seemed to be performing a trick analogous to that of the conjuror who pulls hundreds of yards of white paper out of his mouth from a large assortment of stock adjectives she chose with unerring deftness and rapidity the one that taste and discrimination would most surely have rejected fitting out her subject with a whole wardrobe of slopshop epithets irrelevant in cut and size to the invaluable knack of not disturbing the association of ideas in her audience she added the gift of what may be called a confidential manner so that her fluent generalizations about goethe and his place in literature the lecture was of course manufactured out of lewess book had the flavor of personal experience of views sympathetically exchanged with her audience on the best way of knitting childrens socks or of putting up preserves for the winter it was i am sure to this personal accent the moral equivalent of her dimple that mrs amyot owed her prodigious her irrational success it was her art of transposing secondhand ideas into firsthand emotions that so endeared her to her feminine listeners to any one not in search of documents mrs amyots success was hardly of a kind to make her more interesting and my curiosity flagged with the growing conviction that the suffering entailed on her by public speaking was at most a retrospective pang i was sure that she had reached the point of measuring and enjoying her effects of deliberately manipulating her public and there must indeed have been a certain exhilaration in attaining results so considerable by means involving so little conscious effort mrs amyots art was simply an extension of coquetry she flirted with her audience in this mood of enlightened skepticism i responded but languidly to my hostesss suggestion that i should go with her that evening to see mrs amyot the aunt who had translated euripides was at home on saturday evenings and one met thoughtful people there my hostess explained it was one of the intellectual centres of boston my mood remained distinctly resentful of any connection between mrs amyot and intellectuality and i declined to go but the next day i met mrs amyot in the street she stopped me reproachfully she had heard i was in boston why had i not come last night she had been told that i was at her lecture and it had frightened her yes really almost as much as years ago in hillbridge she never could get over that stupid shyness and the whole business was as distasteful to her as ever but what could she do there was the baby he was a big boy now and boys were so expensive but did i really think she had improved the least little bit and why wouldnt i come home with her now and see the boy and tell her frankly what i had thought of the lecture she had plenty of flattery people were so kind and every one knew that she did it for the baby but what she felt the need of was criticism severe discriminating criticism like mine oh she knew that i was dreadfully discriminating i went home with her and saw the boy in the early heat of her tennysonworship mrs amyot had christened him lancelot and he looked it perhaps however it was his black velvet dress and the exasperating length of his yellow curls together with the fact of his having been taught to recite browning to visitors that raised to feverheat the itching of my palms in his infantsamuellike presence i have since had reason to think that he would have preferred to be called billy and to hunt cats with the other boys in the block his curls and his poetry were simply another outlet for mrs amyots irrepressible coquetry but if lancelot was not genuine his mothers love for him was it justified everything the lectures were for the baby after all i had not been ten minutes in the room before i was pledged to help mrs amyot carry out her triumphant fraud if she wanted to lecture on plato she should plato must take his chance like the rest of us there was no use of course in being discriminating i preserved sufficient reason to avoid that pitfall but i suggested subjects and made lists of books for her with a fatuity that became more obvious as time attenuated the remembrance of her smile i even remember thinking that some men might have cut the knot by marrying her but i handed over plato as a hostage and escaped by the afternoon train the next time i saw her was in new york when she had become so fashionable that it was a part of the whole duty of woman to be seen at her lectures the lady who suggested that of course i ought to go and hear mrs amyot was not very clear about anything except that she was perfectly lovely and had had a horrid husband and was doing it to support her boy the subject of the discourse i think it was on ruskin was clearly of minor importance not only to my friend but to the throng of welldressed and absentminded ladies who rustled in late dropped their muffs and pocketbooks and undisguisedly lost themselves in the study of each others apparel they received mrs amyot with warmth but she evidently represented a social obligation like going to church rather than any more personal interest in fact i suspect that every one of the ladies would have remained away had they been sure that none of the others were coming whether mrs amyot was disheartened by the lack of sympathy between herself and her hearers or whether the sport of arousing it had become a task she certainly imparted her platitudes with less convincing warmth than of old her voice had the same confidential inflections but it was like a voice reproduced by a gramophone the real woman seemed far away she had grown stouter without losing her dewy freshness and her smart gown might have been taken to show either the potentialities of a settled income or a politic concession to the taste of her hearers as i listened i reproached myself for ever having suspected her of selfdeception in saying that she took no pleasure in her work i was sure now that she did it only for lancelot and judging from the size of her audience and the price of the tickets i concluded that lancelot must be receiving a liberal education i was living in new york that winter and in the rotation of dinners i found myself one evening at mrs amyots side the dimple came out at my greeting as punctually as a cuckoo in a swiss clock and i detected the same automatic quality in the tone in which she made her usual pretty demand for advice she was like a musicalbox charged with popular airs they succeeded one another with breathless rapidity but there was a moment after each when the cylinders scraped and whizzed mrs amyot as i found when i called on her was living in a sunny flat with a sittingroom full of flowers and a teatable that had the air of expecting visitors she owned that she had been ridiculously successful it was delightful of course on lancelots account lancelot had been sent to the best school in the country and if things went well and people didnt tire of his silly mother he was to go to harvard afterwards during the next two or three years mrs amyot kept her flat in new york and radiated art and literature upon the suburbs i saw her now and then always stouter better dressed more successful and more automatic she had become a lecturingmachine i went abroad for a year or two and when i came back she had disappeared i asked several people about her but life had closed over her she had been last heard of as lecturing still lecturing but no one seemed to know when or where it was in boston that i found her at last forlornly swaying to the oscillations of an overhead strap in a crowded trolleycar her face had so changed that i lost myself in a startled reckoning of the time that had elapsed since our parting she spoke to me shyly as though aware of my hurried calculation and conscious that in five years she ought not to have altered so much as to upset my notion of time then she seemed to set it down to her dress for she nervously gathered her cloak over a gown that asked only to be concealed and shrank into a seat behind the line of prehensile bipeds blocking the aisle of the car it was perhaps because she so obviously avoided me that i felt for the first time that i might be of use to her and when she left the car i made no excuse for following her she said nothing of needing advice and did not ask me to walk home with her concealing as we talked her transparent preoccupations under the guise of a sudden interest in all i had been doing since she had last seen me of what concerned her i learned only that lancelot was well and that for the present she was not lecturing she was tired and her doctor had ordered her to rest on the doorstep of a shabby house she paused and held out her hand she had been so glad to see me and perhaps if i were in boston again the tired dimple as it were bowed me out and closed the door on the conclusion of the phrase two or three weeks later at my club in new york i found a letter from her in it she owned that she was troubled that of late she had been unsuccessful and that if i chanced to be coming back to boston and could spare her a little of that invaluable advice which a few days later the advice was at her disposal she told me frankly what had happened her public had grown tired of her she had seen it coming on for some time and was shrewd enough in detecting the causes she had more rivals than formerly younger women she admitted with a smile that could still afford to be generous and then her audiences had grown more critical and consequently more exacting lecturing as she understood it used to be simple enough you chose your topic raphael shakespeare gothic architecture or some such big familiar subject and read up about it for a week or so at the athenaeum or the astor library and then told your audience what you had read now it appeared that simple process was no longer adequate people had tired of familiar subjects it was the fashion to be interested in things that one hadnt always known about natural selection animal magnetism sociology and comparative folklore while in literature the demand had become equally difficult to meet since matthew arnold had introduced the habit of studying the influence of one author on another she had tried lecturing on influences and had done very well as long as the public was satisfied with the tracing of such obvious influences as that of turner on ruskin of schiller on goethe of shakespeare on english literature but such investigations had soon lost all charm for her toosophisticated audiences who now demanded either that the influence or the influenced should be quite unknown or that there should be no perceptible connection between the two the zest of the performance lay in the measure of ingenuity with which the lecturer established a relation between two people who had probably never heard of each other much less read each others works a pretty miss williams with red hair had for instance been lecturing with great success on the influence of the rosicrucians upon the poetry of keats while somebody else had given a course on the influence of st thomas aquinas upon professor huxley mrs amyot warmed by my participation in her distress went on to say that the growing demand for evolution was what most troubled her her grandfather had been a pillar of the presbyterian ministry and the idea of her lecturing on darwin or herbert spencer was deeply shocking to her mother and aunts in one sense the family had staked its literary as well as its spiritual hopes on the literal inspiration of genesis what became of the fall of man in the light of modern exegesis the upshot of it was that she had ceased to lecture because she could no longer sell tickets enough to pay for the hire of a lecturehall and as for the managers they wouldnt look at her she had tried her luck all through the eastern states and as far south as washington but it was of no use and unless she could get hold of some new subjects or better still of some new audiences she must simply go out of the business that would mean the failure of all she had worked for since lancelot would have to leave harvard she paused and wept some of the unbecoming tears that spring from real grief lancelot it appeared was to be a genius he had passed his opening examinations brilliantly he had literary gifts he had written beautiful poetry much of which his mother had copied out in reverentially slanting characters in a velvetbound volume which she drew from a locked drawer lancelots verse struck me as nothing more alarming than growingpains but it was not to learn this that she had summoned me what she wanted was to be assured that he was worth working for an assurance which i managed to convey by the simple stratagem of remarking that the poems reminded me of swinburne and so they did as well as of browning tennyson rossetti and all the other poets who supply young authors with original inspirations this point being established it remained to be decided by what means his mother was in the french phrase to pay herself the luxury of a poet it was clear that this indulgence could be bought only with counterfeit coin and that the one way of helping mrs amyot was to become a party to the circulation of such currency my fetish of intellectual integrity went down like a ninepin before the appeal of a woman no longer young and distinctly foolish but full of those dear contradictions and irrelevancies that will always make flesh and blood prevail against a syllogism when i took leave of mrs amyot i had promised her a dozen letters to western universities and had half pledged myself to sketch out a lecture on the reconciliation of science and religion in the west she achieved a success which for a year or more embittered my perusal of the morning papers the fascination that lures the murderer back to the scene of his crime drew my eye to every paragraph celebrating mrs amyots last brilliant lecture on the influence of something upon somebody and her own letters she overwhelmed me with them spared me no detail of the entertainment given in her honor by the palimpsest club of omaha or of her reception at the university of leadville the college professors were especially kind she assured me that she had never before met with such discriminating sympathy i winced at the adjective which cast a sudden light on the vast machinery of fraud that i had set in motion all over my native land men of hitherto unblemished integrity were conniving with me in urging their friends to go and hear mrs amyot lecture on the reconciliation of science and religion my only hope was that somewhere among the number of my accomplices mrs amyot might find one who would marry her in the defense of his convictions none apparently resorted to such heroic measures for about two years later i was startled by the announcement that mrs amyot was lecturing in trenton new jersey on modern theosophy in the light of the vedas the following week she was at newark discussing schopenhauer in the light of recent psychology the week after that i was on the deck of an ocean steamer reconsidering my share in mrs amyots triumphs with the impartiality with which one views an episode that is being left behind at the rate of twenty knots an hour after all i had been helping a mother to educate her son the next ten years of my life were spent in europe and when i came home the recollection of mrs amyot had become as inoffensive as one of those pathetic ghosts who are said to strive in vain to make themselves visible to the living i did not even notice the fact that i no longer heard her spoken of she had dropped like a dead leaf from the bough of memory a year or two after my return i was condemned to one of the worst punishments a worker can undergo an enforced holiday the doctors who pronounced the inhuman sentence decreed that it should be worked out in the south and for a whole winter i carried my cough my thermometer and my idleness from one fashionable orangegrove to another in the vast and melancholy sea of my disoccupation i clutched like a drowning man at any human driftwood within reach i took a critical and depreciatory interest in the coughs the thermometers and the idleness of my fellowsufferers but to the healthy the occupied the transient i clung with undiscriminating enthusiasm in no other way can i explain as i look back on it the importance i attached to the leisurely confidences of a new arrival with a brown beard who tilted back at my side on a hotel veranda hung with roses imparted to me one afternoon the simple annals of his past there was nothing in the tale to kindle the most inflammable imagination and though the man had a pleasant frank face and a voice differing agreeably from the shrill inflections of our fellowlodgers it is probable that under different conditions his discursive history of successful business ventures in a western city would have affected me somewhat in the manner of a lullaby even at the tune i was not sure i liked his agreeable voice it had a selfimportance out of keeping with the humdrum nature of his story as though a breeze engaged in shaking out a tablecloth should have fancied itself inflating a banner but this criticism may have been a mere mark of my own fastidiousness for the man seemed a simple fellow satisfied with his middling fortunes and already he was not much past thirty deepsunk in conjugal content he had just started on an anecdote connected with the cutting of his eldest boys teeth when a lady i knew returning from her late drive paused before us for a moment in the twilight with the smile which is the feminine equivalent of beads to savages wont you take a ticket she said sweetly of course i would take a ticket but for what i ventured to inquire oh thats so good of you for the lecture this evening you neednt go you know were none of us going most of us have been through it already at aiken and at saint augustine and at palm beach ive given away my tickets to some new people whove just come from the north and some of us are going to send our maids just to fill up the room and may i ask to whom you are going to pay this delicate attention oh i thought you knew to poor mrs amyot shes been lecturing all over the south this winter shes simply haunted me ever since i left new york and we had six weeks of her at bar harbor last summer one has to take tickets you know because shes a widow and does it for her son to pay for his education shes so plucky and nice about it and talks about him in such a touching unaffected way that everybody is sorry for her and we all simply ruin ourselves in tickets i do hope that boys nearly educated mrs amyot mrs amyot i repeated is she still educating her son oh do you know about her has she been at it long theres some comfort in that for i suppose when the boys provided for the poor thing will be able to take a rest and give us one she laughed and held out her hand heres your ticket did you say tickets two oh thanks of course you neednt go but i mean to go mrs amyot is an old friend of mine do you really thats awfully good of you perhaps ill go too if i can persuade charlie and the others to come and i wonder in a welldirected aside if your friend i telegraphed her under cover of the dusk that my friend was of too recent standing to be drawn into her charitable toils and she masked her mistake under a rattle of friendly adjurations not to be late and to be sure to keep a seat for her as she had quite made up her mind to go even if charlie and the others wouldnt the flutter of her skirts subsided in the distance and my neighbor who had half turned away to light a cigar made no effort to reopen the conversation at length fearing he might have overheard the allusion to himself i ventured to ask if he were going to the lecture that evening much obliged i have a ticket he said abruptly this struck me as in such bad taste that i made no answer and it was he who spoke next did i understand you to say that you were an old friend of mrs amyots i think i may claim to be if it is the same mrs amyot i had the pleasure of knowing many years ago my mrs amyot used to lecture too to pay for her sons education i believe so well see you later he got up and walked into the house in the hotel drawingroom that evening there was but a meagre sprinkling of guests among whom i saw my brownbearded friend sitting alone on a sofa with his head against the wall it could not have been curiosity to see mrs amyot that had impelled him to attend the performance for it would have been impossible for him without changing his place to command the improvised platform at the end of the room when i looked at him he seemed lost in contemplation of the chandelier the lady from whom i had bought my tickets fluttered in late unattended by charlie and the others and assuring me that she would scream if we had the lecture on ibsen she had heard it three times already that winter a glance at the programme reassured her it informed us in the lecturers own slanting hand that mrs amyot was to lecture on the cosmogony after a long pause during which the small audience coughed and moved its chairs and showed signs of regretting that it had come the door opened and mrs amyot stepped upon the platform ah poor lady some one said hush the coughing and chairshifting subsided and she began it was like looking at ones self early in the morning in a cracked mirror i had no idea i had grown so old as for lancelot he must have a beard a beard the word struck me and without knowing why i glanced across the room at my bearded friend on the sofa oddly enough he was looking at me with a halfdefiant halfsullen expression and as our glances crossed and his fell the conviction came to me that he was lancelot i dont remember a word of the lecture and yet there were enough of them to have filled a goodsized dictionary the stream of mrs amyots eloquence had become a flood one had the despairing sense that she had sprung a leak and that until the plumber came there was nothing to be done about it the plumber came at length in the shape of a clock striking ten my companion with a sigh of relief drifted away in search of charlie and the others the audience scattered with the precipitation of people who had discharged a duty and without surprise i found the brownbearded stranger at my elbow we stood alone in the barefloored room under the flaring chandelier i think you told me this afternoon that you were an old friend of mrs amyots he began awkwardly i assented will you come in and see her now i shall be very glad to if shes ready shes expecting you he interposed he offered no further explanation and i followed him in silence he led me down the long corridor and pushed open the door of a sittingroom mother he said closing the door after we had entered heres the gentleman who says he used to know you mrs amyot who sat in an easychair stirring a cup of bouillon looked up with a start she had evidently not seen me in the audience and her sons description had failed to convey my identity i saw a frightened look in her eyes then like a frost flower on a windowpane the dimple expanded on her wrinkled cheek and she held out her hand im so glad she said so glad she turned to her son who stood watching us you must have told lancelot all about me youve known me so long i havent had time to talk to your son since i knew he was your son i explained her brow cleared then you havent had time to say anything very dreadful she said with a laugh it is he who has been saying dreadful things i returned trying to fall in with her tone i saw my mistake what things she faltered making me feel how old i am by telling me about his children my grandchildren she exclaimed with a blush well if you choose to put it so she laughed again vaguely and was silent i hesitated a moment and then put out my hand i see you are tired i shouldnt have ventured to come in at this hour if your son the son stepped between us yes i asked him to come he said to his mother in his clear selfassertive voice i havent told him anything yet but youve got to now thats what i brought him for his mother straightened herself but i saw her eye waver lancelot she began mr amyot i said turning to the young man if your mother will let me come back tomorrow i shall be very glad he struck his hand hard against the table on which he was leaning no sir it wont take long but its got to be said now he moved nearer to his mother and i saw his lip twitch under his beard after all he was younger and less sure of himself than i had fancied see here mother he went on theres something here thats got to be cleared up and as you say this gentleman is an old friend of yours it had better be cleared up in his presence maybe he can help explain it and if he cant its got to be explained to him mrs amyots lips moved but she made no sound she glanced at me helplessly and sat down my early inclination to thrash lancelot was beginning to reassert itself i took up my hat and moved toward the door mrs amyot is under no obligation to explain anything whatever to me i said curtly well shes under an obligation to me then to explain something in your presence he turned to her again do you know what the people in this hotel are saying do you know what he thinks what they all think that youre doing this lecturing to support me to pay for my education they say you go round telling them so thats what they buy the tickets for they do it out of charity ask him if it isnt what they say ask him if they werent joking about it on the piazza before dinner the others think im a little boy but hes known you for years and he must have known how old i was he must have known it wasnt to pay for my education he stood before her with his hands clenched the veins beating in his temples she had grown very pale and her cheeks looked hollow when she spoke her voice had an odd click in it if if these ladies and gentlemen have been coming to my lectures out of charity i see nothing to be ashamed of in that she faltered if theyve been coming out of charity to me he retorted dont you see youve been making me a party to a fraud isnt there any shame in that his forehead reddened mother cant you see the shame of letting people think i was a d beat who sponged on you for my keep let alone making us both the laughingstock of every place you go to i never did that lancelot did what made you a laughingstock he stepped close to her and caught her wrist will you look me in the face and swear you never told people you were doing this lecturing business to support me there was a long silence he dropped her wrist and she lifted a limp handkerchief to her frightened eyes i did do it to support you to educate you she sobbed were not talking about what you did when i was a boy everybody who knows me knows ive been a grateful son have i ever taken a penny from you since i left college ten years ago i never said you had how can you accuse your mother of such wickedness lancelot have you never told anybody in this hotel or anywhere else in the last ten years that you were lecturing to support me answer me that how can you she wept before a stranger havent you said such things about me to strangers he retorted lancelot well answer me then say you havent mother his voice broke unexpectedly and he took her hand with a gentler touch ill believe anything you tell me he said almost humbly she mistook his tone and raised her head with a rash clutch at dignity i think youd better ask this gentleman to excuse you first no by god i wont he cried this gentleman says he knows all about you and i mean him to know all about me too i dont mean that he or anybody else under this roof shall go on thinking for another twentyfour hours that a cent of their money has ever gone into my pockets since i was old enough to shift for myself and he shant leave this room till youve made that clear to him he stepped back as he spoke and put his shoulders against the door my dear young gentleman i said politely i shall leave this room exactly when i see fit to do so and that is now i have already told you that mrs amyot owes me no explanation of her conduct but i owe you an explanation of mine you and every one who has bought a single one of her lecture tickets do you suppose a man whos been through what i went through while that woman was talking to you in the porch before dinner is going to hold his tongue and not attempt to justify himself no decent man is going to sit down under that sort of thing its enough to ruin his character if youre my mothers friend you owe it to me to hear what ive got to say he pulled out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead good god mother he burst out suddenly what did you do it for havent you had everything you wanted ever since i was able to pay for it havent i paid you back every cent you spent on me when i was in college have i ever gone back on you since i was big enough to work he turned to me with a laugh i thought she did it to amuse herself and because there was such a demand for her lectures such a demand thats what she always told me when we asked her to come out and spend this winter with us in minneapolis she wrote back that she couldnt because she had engagements all through the south and her manager wouldnt let her off thats the reason why i came all the way on here to see her we thought she was the most popular lecturer in the united states my wife and i did we were awfully proud of it too i can tell you he dropped into a chair still laughing how can you lancelot how can you his mother forgetful of my presence was clinging to him with tentative caresses when you didnt need the money any longer i spent it all on the children you know i did yes on lace christening dresses and lifesize rockinghorses with real manes the kind of thing children cant do without oh lancelot lancelot i loved them so how can you believe such falsehoods about me what falsehoods about you that i ever told anybody such dreadful things he put her back gently keeping his eyes on hers did you never tell anybody in this house that you were lecturing to support your son her hands dropped from his shoulders and she flashed round on me in sudden anger i know what i think of people who call themselves friends and who come between a mother and her son oh mother mother he groaned i went up to him and laid my hand on his shoulder my dear man i said dont you see the uselessness of prolonging this yes i do he answered abruptly and before i could forestall his movement he rose and walked out of the room there was a long silence measured by the lessening reverberations of his footsteps down the wooden floor of the corridor when they ceased i approached mrs amyot who had sunk into her chair i held out my hand and she took it without a trace of resentment on her ravaged face i sent his wife a sealskin jacket at christmas she said with the tears running down her cheeks souls belated their railwaycarriage had been full when the train left bologna but at the first station beyond milan their only remaining companion a courtly person who ate garlic out of a carpetbag had left his crumbstrewn seat with a bow lydias eye regretfully followed the shiny broadcloth of his retreating back till it lost itself in the cloud of touts and cabdrivers hanging about the station then she glanced across at gannett and caught the same regret in his look they were both sorry to be alone partenza shouted the guard the train vibrated to a sudden slamming of doors a waiter ran along the platform with a tray of fossilized sandwiches a belated porter flung a bundle of shawls and bandboxes into a thirdclass carriage the guard snapped out a brief partensa which indicated the purely ornamental nature of his first shout and the train swung out of the station the direction of the road had changed and a shaft of sunlight struck across the dusty red velvet seats into lydias corner gannett did not notice it he had returned to his revue de paris and she had to rise and lower the shade of the farther window against the vast horizon of their leisure such incidents stood out sharply having lowered the shade lydia sat down leaving the length of the carriage between herself and gannett at length he missed her and looked up i moved out of the sun she hastily explained he looked at her curiously the sun was beating on her through the shade very well he said pleasantly adding you dont mind as he drew a cigarettecase from his pocket it was a refreshing touch relieving the tension of her spirit with the suggestion that after all if he could smoke the relief was only momentary her experience of smokers was limited her husband had disapproved of the use of tobacco but she knew from hearsay that men sometimes smoked to get away from things that a cigar might be the masculine equivalent of darkened windows and a headache gannett after a puff or two returned to his review it was just as she had foreseen he feared to speak as much as she did it was one of the misfortunes of their situation that they were never busy enough to necessitate or even to justify the postponement of unpleasant discussions if they avoided a question it was obviously unconcealably because the question was disagreeable they had unlimited leisure and an accumulation of mental energy to devote to any subject that presented itself new topics were in fact at a premium lydia sometimes had premonitions of a faminestricken period when there would he nothing left to talk about and she had already caught herself doling out piecemeal what in the first prodigality of their confidences she would have flung to him in a breath their silence therefore might simply mean that they had nothing to say but it was another disadvantage of their position that it allowed infinite opportunity for the classification of minute differences lydia had learned to distinguish between real and factitious silences and under gannetts she now detected a hum of speech to which her own thoughts made breathless answer how could it be otherwise with that thing between them she glanced up at the rack overhead the thing was there in her dressingbag symbolically suspended over her head and his he was thinking of it now just as she was they had been thinking of it in unison ever since they had entered the train while the carriage had held other travellers they had screened her from his thoughts but now that he and she were alone she knew exactly what was passing through his mind she could almost hear him asking himself what he should say to her the thing had come that morning brought up to her in an innocentlooking envelope with the rest of their letters as they were leaving the hotel at bologna as she tore it open she and gannett were laughing over some ineptitude of the local guidebook they had been driven of late to make the most of such incidental humors of travel even when she had unfolded the document she took it for some unimportant business paper sent abroad for her signature and her eye travelled inattentively over the curly whereases of the preamble until a word arrested her divorce there it stood an impassable barrier between her husbands name and hers she had been prepared for it of course as healthy people are said to be prepared for death in the sense of knowing it must come without in the least expecting that it will she had known from the first that tillotson meant to divorce her but what did it matter nothing mattered in those first days of supreme deliverance but the fact that she was free and not so much she had begun to be aware that freedom had released her from tillotson as that it had given her to gannett this discovery had not been agreeable to her selfesteem she had preferred to think that tillotson had himself embodied all her reasons for leaving him and those he represented had seemed cogent enough to stand in no need of reinforcement yet she had not left him till she met gannett it was her love for gannett that had made life with tillotson so poor and incomplete a business if she had never from the first regarded her marriage as a full cancelling of her claims upon life she had at least for a number of years accepted it as a provisional compensation she had made it do existence in the commodious tillotson mansion in fifth avenue with mrs tillotson senior commanding the approaches from the secondstory front windows had been reduced to a series of purely automatic acts the moral atmosphere of the tillotson interior was as carefully screened and curtained as the house itself mrs tillotson senior dreaded ideas as much as a draught in her back prudent people liked an even temperature and to do anything unexpected was as foolish as going out in the rain one of the chief advantages of being rich was that one need not be exposed to unforeseen contingencies by the use of ordinary firmness and common sense one could make sure of doing exactly the same thing every day at the same hour these doctrines reverentially imbibed with his mothers milk tillotson a model son who had never given his parents an hours anxiety complacently expounded to his wife testifying to his sense of their importance by the regularity with which he wore goloshes on damp days his punctuality at meals and his elaborate precautions against burglars and contagious diseases lydia coming from a smaller town and entering new york life through the portals of the tillotson mansion had mechanically accepted this point of view as inseparable from having a front pew in church and a parterre box at the opera all the people who came to the house revolved in the same small circle of prejudices it was the kind of society in which after dinner the ladies compared the exorbitant charges of their childrens teachers and agreed that even with the new duties on french clothes it was cheaper in the end to get everything from worth while the husbands over their cigars lamented municipal corruption and decided that the men to start a reform were those who had no private interests at stake to lydia this view of life had become a matter of course just as lumbering about in her motherinlaws landau had come to seem the only possible means of locomotion and listening every sunday to a fashionable presbyterian divine the inevitable atonement for having thought oneself bored on the other six days of the week before she met gannett her life had seemed merely dull his coming made it appear like one of those dismal cruikshank prints in which the people are all ugly and all engaged in occupations that are either vulgar or stupid it was natural that tillotson should be the chief sufferer from this readjustment of focus gannetts nearness had made her husband ridiculous and a part of the ridicule had been reflected on herself her tolerance laid her open to a suspicion of obtuseness from which she must at all costs clear herself in gannetts eyes she did not understand this until afterwards at the time she fancied that she had merely reached the limits of endurance in so large a charter of liberties as the mere act of leaving tillotson seemed to confer the small question of divorce or no divorce did not count it was when she saw that she had left her husband only to be with gannett that she perceived the significance of anything affecting their relations her husband in casting her off had virtually flung her at gannett it was thus that the world viewed it the measure of alacrity with which gannett would receive her would be the subject of curious speculation over afternoontea tables and in club corners she knew what would be said she had heard it so often of others the recollection bathed her in misery the men would probably back gannett to do the decent thing but the ladies eyebrows would emphasize the worthlessness of such enforced fidelity and after all they would be right she had put herself in a position where gannett owed her something where as a gentleman he was bound to stand the damage the idea of accepting such compensation had never crossed her mind the socalled rehabilitation of such a marriage had always seemed to her the only real disgrace what she dreaded was the necessity of having to explain herself of having to combat his arguments of calculating in spite of herself the exact measure of insistence with which he pressed them she knew not whether she most shrank from his insisting too much or too little in such a case the nicest sense of proportion might be at fault and how easy to fall into the error of taking her resistance for a test of his sincerity whichever way she turned an ironical implication confronted her she had the exasperated sense of having walked into the trap of some stupid practical joke beneath all these preoccupations lurked the dread of what he was thinking sooner or later of course he would have to speak but that in the meantime he should think even for a moment that there was any use in speaking seemed to her simply unendurable her sensitiveness on this point was aggravated by another fear as yet barely on the level of consciousness the fear of unwillingly involving gannett in the trammels of her dependence to look upon him as the instrument of her liberation to resist in herself the least tendency to a wifely taking possession of his future had seemed to lydia the one way of maintaining the dignity of their relation her view had not changed but she was aware of a growing inability to keep her thoughts fixed on the essential point the point of parting with gannett it was easy to face as long as she kept it sufficiently far off but what was this act of mental postponement but a gradual encroachment on his future what was needful was the courage to recognize the moment when by some word or look their voluntary fellowship should be transformed into a bondage the more wearing that it was based on none of those common obligations which make the most imperfect marriage in some sort a centre of gravity when the porter at the next station threw the door open lydia drew back making way for the hopedfor intruder but none came and the train took up its leisurely progress through the spring wheatfields and budding copses she now began to hope that gannett would speak before the next station she watched him furtively halfdisposed to return to the seat opposite his but there was an artificiality about his absorption that restrained her she had never before seen him read with so conspicuous an air of warding off interruption what could he be thinking of why should he be afraid to speak or was it her answer that he dreaded the train paused for the passing of an express and he put down his book and leaned out of the window presently he turned to her with a smile theres a jolly old villa out here he said his easy tone relieved her and she smiled back at him as she crossed over to his corner beyond the embankment through the opening in a mossy wall she caught sight of the villa with its broken balustrades its stagnant fountains and the stone satyr closing the perspective of a dusky grasswalk how should you like to live there he asked as the train moved on there in some such place i mean one might do worse dont you think so there must be at least two centuries of solitude under those yewtrees shouldnt you like it i i dont know she faltered she knew now that he meant to speak he lit another cigarette we shall have to live somewhere you know he said as he bent above the match lydia tried to speak carelessly je nen vois pas la n—Äcessit—Ä why not live everywhere as we have been doing but we cant travel forever can we oh forevers a long word she objected picking up the review he had thrown aside for the rest of our lives then he said moving nearer she made a slight gesture which caused his hand to slip from hers why should we make plans i thought you agreed with me that its pleasanter to drift he looked at her hesitatingly its been pleasant certainly but i suppose i shall have to get at my work again some day you know i havent written a line since all this time he hastily emended she flamed with sympathy and selfreproach oh if you mean that if you want to write of course we must settle down how stupid of me not to have thought of it sooner where shall we go where do you think you could work best we oughtnt to lose any more time he hesitated again i had thought of a villa in these parts its quiet we shouldnt be bothered should you like it of course i should like it she paused and looked away but i thought i remember your telling me once that your best work had been done in a crowd in big cities why should you shut yourself up in a desert gannett for a moment made no reply at length he said avoiding her eye as carefully as she avoided his it might be different now i cant tell of course till i try a writer ought not to be dependent on his milieu its a mistake to humor oneself in that way and i thought that just at first you might prefer to be she faced him to be what well quiet i mean what do you mean by at first she interrupted he paused again i mean after we are married she thrust up her chin and turned toward the window thank you she tossed back at him lydia he exclaimed blankly and she felt in every fibre of her averted person that he had made the inconceivable the unpardonable mistake of anticipating her acquiescence the train rattled on and he groped for a third cigarette lydia remained silent i havent offended you he ventured at length in the tone of a man who feels his way she shook her head with a sigh i thought you understood she moaned their eyes met and she moved back to his side do you want to know how not to offend me by taking it for granted once for all that youve said your say on this odious question and that ive said mine and that we stand just where we did this morning before that that hateful paper came to spoil everything between us to spoil everything between us what on earth do you mean arent you glad to be free i was free before not to marry me he suggested but i dont want to marry you she cried she saw that he turned pale im obtuse i suppose he said slowly i confess i dont see what youre driving at are you tired of the whole business or was i simply a an excuse for getting away perhaps you didnt care to travel alone was that it and now you want to chuck me his voice had grown harsh you owe me a straight answer you know dont be tenderhearted her eyes swam as she leaned to him dont you see its because i care because i care so much oh ralph cant you see how it would humiliate me try to feel it as a woman would dont you see the misery of being made your wife in this way if id known you as a girl that would have been a real marriage but now this vulgar fraud upon society and upon a society we despised and laughed at this sneaking back into a position that weve voluntarily forfeited dont you see what a cheap compromise it is we neither of us believe in the abstract sacredness of marriage we both know that no ceremony is needed to consecrate our love for each other what object can we have in marrying except the secret fear of each that the other may escape or the secret longing to work our way back gradually oh very gradually into the esteem of the people whose conventional morality we have always ridiculed and hated and the very fact that after a decent interval these same people would come and dine with us the women who talk about the indissolubility of marriage and who would let me die in a gutter today because i am leading a life of sin doesnt that disgust you more than their turning their backs on us now i can stand being cut by them but i couldnt stand their coming to call and asking what i meant to do about visiting that unfortunate mrs soandso she paused and gannett maintained a perplexed silence you judge things too theoretically he said at length slowly life is made up of compromises the life we ran away from yes if we had been willing to accept them she flushed we might have gone on meeting each other at mrs tillotsons dinners he smiled slightly i didnt know that we ran away to found a new system of ethics i supposed it was because we loved each other life is complex of course isnt it the very recognition of that fact that separates us from the people who see it tout dune pi—Ä—ëce if they are right if marriage is sacred in itself and the individual must always be sacrificed to the family then there can be no real marriage between us since our our being together is a protest against the sacrifice of the individual to the family she interrupted herself with a laugh youll say now that im giving you a lecture on sociology of course one acts as one can as one must perhaps pulled by all sorts of invisible threads but at least one neednt pretend for social advantages to subscribe to a creed that ignores the complexity of human motives that classifies people by arbitrary signs and puts it in everybodys reach to be on mrs tillotsons visitinglist it may be necessary that the world should be ruled by conventions but if we believed in them why did we break through them and if we dont believe in them is it honest to take advantage of the protection they afford gannett hesitated one may believe in them or not but as long as they do rule the world it is only by taking advantage of their protection that one can find a modus vivendi do outlaws need a modus vivendi he looked at her hopelessly nothing is more perplexing to man than the mental process of a woman who reasons her emotions she thought she had scored a point and followed it up passionately you do understand dont you you see how the very thought of the thing humiliates me we are together today because we choose to be dont let us look any farther than that she caught his hands promise me youll never speak of it again promise me youll never think of it even she implored with a tearful prodigality of italics through what followed his protests his arguments his final unconvinced submission to her wishes she had a sense of his but halfdiscerning all that for her had made the moment so tumultuous they had reached that memorable point in every hearthistory when for the first time the man seems obtuse and the woman irrational it was the abundance of his intentions that consoled her on reflection for what they lacked in quality after all it would have been worse incalculably worse to have detected any overreadiness to understand her ii when the train at nightfall brought them to their journeys end at the edge of one of the lakes lydia was glad that they were not as usual to pass from one solitude to another their wanderings during the year had indeed been like the flight of outlaws through sicily dalmatia transylvania and southern italy they had persisted in their tacit avoidance of their kind isolation at first had deepened the flavor of their happiness as night intensifies the scent of certain flowers but in the new phase on which they were entering lydias chief wish was that they should be less abnormally exposed to the action of each others thoughts she shrank nevertheless as the brightlylooming bulk of the fashionable angloamerican hotel on the waters brink began to radiate toward their advancing boat its vivid suggestion of social order visitors lists church services and the bland inquisition of the tabledh—Åte the mere fact that in a moment or two she must take her place on the hotel register as mrs gannett seemed to weaken the springs of her resistance they had meant to stay for a night only on their way to a lofty village among the glaciers of monte rosa but after the first plunge into publicity when they entered the diningroom lydia felt the relief of being lost in a crowd of ceasing for a moment to be the centre of gannetts scrutiny and in his face she caught the reflection of her feeling after dinner when she went upstairs he strolled into the smokingroom and an hour or two later sitting in the darkness of her window she heard his voice below and saw him walking up and down the terrace with a companion cigar at his side when he came up he told her he had been talking to the hotel chaplain a very good sort of fellow queer little microcosms these hotels most of these people live here all summer and then migrate to italy or the riviera the english are the only people who can lead that kind of life with dignity those softvoiced old ladies in shetland shawls somehow carry the british empire under their caps civis romanus sum its a curious study there might be some good things to work up here he stood before her with the vivid preoccupied stare of the novelist on the trail of a subject with a relief that was half painful she noticed that for the first time since they had been together he was hardly aware of her presence do you think you could write here here i dont know his stare dropped after being out of things so long ones first impressions are bound to be tremendously vivid you know i see a dozen threads already that one might follow he broke off with a touch of embarrassment then follow them well stay she said with sudden decision stay here he glanced at her in surprise and then walking to the window looked out upon the dusky slumber of the garden why not she said at length in a tone of veiled irritation the place is full of old cats in caps who gossip with the chaplain shall you like i mean it would be different if she flamed up do you suppose i care its none of their business of course not but you wont get them to think so they may think what they please he looked at her doubtfully its for you to decide well stay she repeated gannett before they met had made himself known as a successful writer of short stories and of a novel which had achieved the distinction of being widely discussed the reviewers called him promising and lydia now accused herself of having too long interfered with the fulfilment of his promise there was a special irony in the fact since his passionate assurances that only the stimulus of her companionship could bring out his latent faculty had almost given the dignity of a vocation to her course there had been moments when she had felt unable to assume before posterity the responsibility of thwarting his career and after all he had not written a line since they had been together his first desire to write had come from renewed contact with the world was it all a mistake then must the most intelligent choice work more disastrously than the blundering combinations of chance or was there a still more humiliating answer to her perplexities his sudden impulse of activity so exactly coincided with her own wish to withdraw for a time from the range of his observation that she wondered if he too were not seeking sanctuary from intolerable problems you must begin tomorrow she cried hiding a tremor under the laugh with which she added i wonder if theres any ink in the inkstand whatever else they had at the hotel bellosguardo they had as miss pinsent said a certain tone it was to lady susan condit that they owed this inestimable benefit an advantage ranking in miss pinsents opinion above even the lawn tennis courts and the resident chaplain it was the fact of lady susans annual visit that made the hotel what it was miss pinsent was certainly the last to underrate such a privilege its so important my dear forming as we do a little family that there should be some one to give the tone and no one could do it better than lady susan an earls daughter and a person of such determination dear mrs ainger now who really ought you know when lady susans away absolutely refuses to assert herself miss pinsent sniffed derisively a bishops niece my dear i saw her once actually give in to some south americans and before us all she gave up her seat at table to oblige them such a lack of dignity lady susan spoke to her very plainly about it afterwards miss pinsent glanced across the lake and adjusted her auburn front but of course i dont deny that the stand lady susan takes is not always easy to live up to for the rest of us i mean monsieur grossart our good proprietor finds it trying at times i know he has said as much privately to mrs ainger and me after all the poor man is not to blame for wanting to fill his hotel is he and lady susan is so difficult so very difficult about new people one might almost say that she disapproves of them beforehand on principle and yet shes had warnings she very nearly made a dreadful mistake once with the duchess of levens who dyed her hair and well swore and smoked one would have thought that might have been a lesson to lady susan miss pinsent resumed her knitting with a sigh there are exceptions of course she took at once to you and mr gannett it was quite remarkable really oh i dont mean that either of course not it was perfectly natural we all thought you so charming and interesting from the first day we knew at once that mr gannett was intellectual by the magazines you took in but you know what i mean lady susan is so very well i wont say prejudiced as mrs ainger does but so prepared not to like new people that her taking to you in that way was a surprise to us all i confess miss pinsent sent a significant glance down the long laurustinus alley from the other end of which two people a lady and gentleman were strolling toward them through the smiling neglect of the garden in this case of course its very different that im willing to admit their looks are against them but as mrs ainger says one cant exactly tell them so shes very handsome lydia ventured with her eyes on the lady who showed under the dome of a vivid sunshade the hourglass figure and superlative coloring of a christmas chromo thats the worst of it shes too handsome well after all she cant help that other people manage to said miss pinsent skeptically but isnt it rather unfair of lady susan considering that nothing is known about them but my dear thats the very thing thats against them its infinitely worse than any actual knowledge lydia mentally agreed that in the case of mrs linton it possibly might be i wonder why they came here she mused thats against them too its always a bad sign when loud people come to a quiet place and theyve brought vanloads of boxes her maid told mrs aingers that they meant to stop indefinitely and lady susan actually turned her back on her in the salon my dear she said it was for our sakes that makes it so unanswerable but poor grossart is in a way the lintons have taken his most expensive suite you know the yellow damask drawingroom above the portico and they have champagne with every meal they were silent as mr and mrs linton sauntered by the lady with tempestuous brows and challenging chin the gentleman a blond stripling trailing after her head downward like a reluctant child dragged by his nurse what does your husband think of them my dear miss pinsent whispered as they passed out of earshot lydia stooped to pick a violet in the border he hasnt told me of your speaking to them i mean would he approve of that i know how very particular nice americans are i think your action might make a difference it would certainly carry weight with lady susan dear miss pinsent you flatter me lydia rose and gathered up her book and sunshade well if youre asked for an opinion if lady susan asks you for one i think you ought to be prepared miss pinsent admonished her as she moved away iii lady susan held her own she ignored the lintons and her little family as miss pinsent phrased it followed suit even mrs ainger agreed that it was obligatory if lady susan owed it to the others not to speak to the lintons the others clearly owed it to lady susan to back her up it was generally found expedient at the hotel bellosguardo to adopt this form of reasoning whatever effect this combined action may have had upon the lintons it did not at least have that of driving them away monsieur grossart after a few days of suspense had the satisfaction of seeing them settle down in his yellow damask premier with what looked like a permanent installation of palmtrees and silk sofacushions and a gratifying continuance in the consumption of champagne mrs linton trailed her doucet draperies up and down the garden with the same challenging air while her husband smoking innumerable cigarettes dragged himself dejectedly in her wake but neither of them after the first encounter with lady susan made any attempt to extend their acquaintance they simply ignored their ignorers as miss pinsent resentfully observed they behaved exactly as though the hotel were empty it was therefore a matter of surprise as well as of displeasure to lydia to find on glancing up one day from her seat in the garden that the shadow which had fallen across her book was that of the enigmatic mrs linton i want to speak to you that lady said in a rich hard voice that seemed the audible expression of her gown and her complexion lydia started she certainly did not want to speak to mrs linton shall i sit down here the latter continued fixing her intenselyshaded eyes on lydias face or are you afraid of being seen with me afraid lydia colored sit down please what is it that you wish to say mrs linton with a smile drew up a gardenchair and crossed one openwork ankle above the other i want you to tell me what my husband said to your husband last night lydia turned pale my husband to yours she faltered staring at the other didnt you know they were closeted together for hours in the smokingroom after you went upstairs my man didnt get to bed until nearly two oclock and when he did i couldnt get a word out of him when he wants to be aggravating ill back him against anybody living her teeth and eyes flashed persuasively upon lydia but youll tell me what they were talking about wont you i know i can trust you you look so awfully kind and its for his own good hes such a precious donkey and im so afraid hes got into some beastly scrape or other if hed only trust his own old woman but theyre always writing to him and setting him against me and ive got nobody to turn to she laid her hand on lydias with a rattle of bracelets youll help me wont you lydia drew back from the smiling fierceness of her brows im sorry but i dont think i understand my husband has said nothing to me of of yours the great black crescents above mrs lintons eyes met angrily i say is that true she demanded lydia rose from her seat oh look here i didnt mean that you know you mustnt take one up so cant you see how rattled i am lydia saw that in fact her beautiful mouth was quivering beneath softened eyes im beside myself the splendid creature wailed dropping into her seat im so sorry lydia repeated forcing herself to speak kindly but how can i help you mrs linton raised her head sharply by finding out theres a darling finding what out what trevenna told him trevenna lydia echoed in bewilderment mrs linton clapped her hand to her mouth oh lord there its out what a fool i am but i supposed of course you knew i supposed everybody knew she dried her eyes and bridled didnt you know that hes lord trevenna im mrs cope lydia recognized the names they had figured in a flamboyant elopement which had thrilled fashionable london some six months earlier now you see how it is you understand dont you mrs cope continued on a note of appeal i knew you would thats the reason i came to you i suppose he felt the same thing about your husband hes not spoken to another soul in the place her face grew anxious again hes awfully sensitive generally he feels our position he says as if it wasnt my place to feel that but when he does get talking theres no knowing what hell say i know hes been brooding over something lately and i must find out what it is its to his interest that i should i always tell him that i think only of his interest if hed only trust me but hes been so odd lately i cant think what hes plotting you will help me dear lydia who had remained standing looked away uncomfortably if you mean by finding out what lord trevenna has told my husband im afraid its impossible why impossible because i infer that it was told in confidence mrs cope stared incredulously well what of that your husband looks such a dear any one can see hes awfully gone on you whats to prevent your getting it out of him lydia flushed im not a spy she exclaimed a spy a spy how dare you mrs cope flamed out oh i dont mean that either dont be angry with me im so miserable she essayed a softer note do you call that spying for one woman to help out another i do need help so dreadfully im at my wits end with trevenna i am indeed hes such a boy a mere baby you know hes only twoandtwenty she dropped her orbed lids hes younger than me only fancy a few months younger i tell him he ought to listen to me as if i was his mother oughtnt he now but he wont he wont all his people are at him you see oh i know their little game trying to get him away from me before i can get my divorce thats what theyre up to at first he wouldnt listen to them he used to toss their letters over to me to read but now he reads them himself and answers em too i fancy hes always shut up in his room writing if i only knew what his plan is i could stop him fast enough hes such a simpleton but hes dreadfully deep too at times i cant make him out but i know hes told your husband everything i knew that last night the minute i laid eyes on him and i must find out you must help me ive got no one else to turn to she caught lydias fingers in a stormy pressure say youll help me you and your husband lydia tried to free herself what you ask is impossible you must see that it is no one could interfere in in the way you ask mrs copes clutch tightened you wont then you wont certainly not let me go please mrs cope released her with a laugh oh go by all means pray dont let me detain you shall you go and tell lady susan condit that theres a pair of us or shall i save you the trouble of enlightening her lydia stood still in the middle of the path seeing her antagonist through a mist of terror mrs cope was still laughing oh im not spiteful by nature my dear but youre a little more than flesh and blood can stand its impossible is it let you go indeed youre too good to be mixed up in my affairs are you why you little fool the first day i laid eyes on you i saw that you and i were both in the same box thats the reason i spoke to you she stepped nearer her smile dilating on lydia like a lamp through a fog you can take your choice you know i always play fair if youll tell ill promise not to now then which is it to be lydia involuntarily had begun to move away from the pelting storm of words but at this she turned and sat down again you may go she said simply i shall stay here iv she stayed there for a long time in the hypnotized contemplation not of mrs copes present but of her own past gannett early that morning had gone off on a long walk he had fallen into the habit of taking these mountaintramps with various fellowlodgers but even had he been within reach she could not have gone to him just then she had to deal with herself first she was surprised to find how in the last months she had lost the habit of introspection since their coming to the hotel bellosguardo she and gannett had tacitly avoided themselves and each other she was aroused by the whistle of the three oclock steamboat as it neared the landing just beyond the hotel gates three oclock then gannett would soon be back he had told her to expect him before four she rose hurriedly her face averted from the inquisitorial facade of the hotel she could not see him just yet she could not go indoors she slipped through one of the overgrown gardenalleys and climbed a steep path to the hills it was dark when she opened their sittingroom door gannett was sitting on the windowledge smoking a cigarette cigarettes were now his chief resource he had not written a line during the two months they had spent at the hotel bellosguardo in that respect it had turned out not to be the right milieu after all he started up at lydias entrance where have you been i was getting anxious she sat down in a chair near the door up the mountain she said wearily alone yes gannett threw away his cigarette the sound of her voice made him want to see her face shall we have a little light he suggested she made no answer and he lifted the globe from the lamp and put a match to the wick then he looked at her anything wrong you look done up she sat glancing vaguely about the little sittingroom dimly lit by the pallidglobed lamp which left in twilight the outlines of the furniture of his writingtable heaped with books and papers of the tearoses and jasmine drooping on the mantelpiece how like home it had all grown how like home lydia what is wrong he repeated she moved away from him feeling for her hatpins and turning to lay her hat and sunshade on the table suddenly she said that woman has been talking to me gannett stared that woman what woman mrs linton mrs cope he gave a start of annoyance still as she perceived not grasping the full import of her words the deuce she told you she told me everything gannett looked at her anxiously what impudence im so sorry that you should have been exposed to this dear exposed lydia laughed gannetts brow clouded and they looked away from each other do you know why she told me she had the best of reasons the first time she laid eyes on me she saw that we were both in the same box lydia so it was natural of course that she should turn to me in a difficulty what difficulty it seems she has reason to think that lord trevennas people are trying to get him away from her before she gets her divorce well and she fancied he had been consulting with you last night as to as to the best way of escaping from her gannett stood up with an angry forehead well what concern of yours was all this dirty business why should she go to you dont you see its so simple i was to wheedle his secret out of you to oblige that woman yes or if i was unwilling to oblige her then to protect myself to protect yourself against whom against her telling every one in the hotel that she and i are in the same box she threatened that she left me the choice of telling it myself or of doing it for me the beast there was a long silence lydia had seated herself on the sofa beyond the radius of the lamp and he leaned against the window his next question surprised her when did this happen at what time i mean she looked at him vaguely i dont know after luncheon i think yes i remember it must have been at about three oclock he stepped into the middle of the room and as he approached the light she saw that his brow had cleared why do you ask she said because when i came in at about halfpast three the mail was just being distributed and mrs cope was waiting as usual to pounce on her letters you know she was always watching for the postman she was standing so close to me that i couldnt help seeing a big officiallooking envelope that was handed to her she tore it open gave one look at the inside and rushed off upstairs like a whirlwind with the director shouting after her that she had left all her other letters behind i dont believe she ever thought of you again after that paper was put into her hand why because she was too busy i was sitting in the window watching for you when the five oclock boat left and who should go on board bag and baggage valet and maid dressingbags and poodle but mrs cope and trevenna just an hour and a half to pack up in and you should have seen her when they started she was radiant shaking hands with everybody waving her handkerchief from the deck distributing bows and smiles like an empress if ever a woman got what she wanted just in the nick of time that woman did shell be lady trevenna within a week ill wager you think she has her divorce im sure of it and she must have got it just after her talk with you lydia was silent at length she said with a kind of reluctance she was horribly angry when she left me it wouldnt have taken long to tell lady susan condit lady susan condit has not been told how do you know because when i went downstairs half an hour ago i met lady susan on the way he stopped half smiling well and she stopped to ask if i thought you would act as patroness to a charity concert she is getting up in spite of themselves they both broke into a laugh lydias ended in sobs and she sank down with her face hidden gannett bent over her seeking her hands that vile woman i ought to have warned you to keep away from her i cant forgive myself but he spoke to me in confidence and i never dreamed well its all over now lydia lifted her head not for me its only just beginning what do you mean she put him gently aside and moved in her turn to the window then she went on with her face turned toward the shimmering blackness of the lake you see of course that it might happen again at any moment what this this risk of being found out and we could hardly count again on such a lucky combination of chances could we he sat down with a groan still keeping her face toward the darkness she said i want you to go and tell lady susan and the others gannett who had moved towards her paused a few feet off why do you wish me to do this he said at length with less surprise in his voice than she had been prepared for because ive behaved basely abominably since we came here letting these people believe we were married lying with every breath i drew yes ive felt that too gannett exclaimed with sudden energy the words shook her like a tempest all her thoughts seemed to fall about her in ruins you youve felt so of course i have he spoke with lowvoiced vehemence do you suppose i like playing the sneak any better than you do its damnable he had dropped on the arm of a chair and they stared at each other like blind people who suddenly see but you have liked it here she faltered oh ive liked it ive liked it he moved impatiently havent you yes she burst out thats the worst of it thats what i cant bear i fancied it was for your sake that i insisted on staying because you thought you could write here and perhaps just at first that really was the reason but afterwards i wanted to stay myself i loved it she broke into a laugh oh do you see the full derision of it these people the very prototypes of the bores you took me away from with the same fenced in view of life the same keepoffthegrass morality the same little cautious virtues and the same little frightened vices well ive clung to them ive delighted in them ive done my best to please them ive toadied lady susan ive gossiped with miss pinsent ive pretended to be shocked with mrs ainger respectability it was the one thing in life that i was sure i didnt care about and its grown so precious to me that ive stolen it because i couldnt get it in any other way she moved across the room and returned to his side with another laugh i who used to fancy myself unconventional i must have been born with a cardcase in my hand you should have seen me with that poor woman in the garden she came to me for help poor creature because she fancied that having sinned as they call it i might feel some pity for others who had been tempted in the same way not i she didnt know me lady susan would have been kinder because lady susan wouldnt have been afraid i hated the woman my one thought was not to be seen with her i could have killed her for guessing my secret the one thing that mattered to me at that moment was my standing with lady susan gannett did not speak and you youve felt it too she broke out accusingly youve enjoyed being with these people as much as i have youve let the chaplain talk to you by the hour about the reign of law and professor drummond when they asked you to hand the plate in church i was watching you you wanted to accept she stepped close laying her hand on his arm do you know i begin to see what marriage is for its to keep people away from each other sometimes i think that two people who love each other can be saved from madness only by the things that come between them children duties visits bores relations the things that protect married people from each other weve been too close together that has been our sin weve seen the nakedness of each others souls she sank again on the sofa hiding her face in her hands gannett stood above her perplexedly he felt as though she were being swept away by some implacable current while he stood helpless on its bank at length he said lydia dont think me a brute but dont you see yourself that it wont do yes i see it wont do she said without raising her head his face cleared then well go tomorrow go where to paris to be married for a long time she made no answer then she asked slowly would they have us here if we were married have us here i mean lady susan and the others have us here of course they would not if they knew at least not unless they could pretend not to know he made an impatient gesture we shouldnt come back here of course and other people neednt know no one need know she sighed then its only another form of deception and a meaner one dont you see that i see that were not accountable to any lady susans on earth then why are you ashamed of what we are doing here because im sick of pretending that youre my wife when youre not when you wont be she looked at him sadly if i were your wife youd have to go on pretending youd have to pretend that id never been anything else and our friends would have to pretend that they believed what you pretended gannett pulled off the sofatassel and flung it away youre impossible he groaned its not i its our being together thats impossible i only want you to see that marriage wont help it what will help it then she raised her head my leaving you your leaving me he sat motionless staring at the tassel which lay at the other end of the room at length some impulse of retaliation for the pain she was inflicting made him say deliberately and where would you go if you left me oh she cried he was at her side in an instant lydia lydia you know i didnt mean it i couldnt mean it but youve driven me out of my senses i dont know what im saying cant you get out of this labyrinth of selftorture its destroying us both thats why i must leave you how easily you say it he drew her hands down and made her face him youre very scrupulous about yourself and others but have you thought of me you have no right to leave me unless youve ceased to care its because i care then i have a right to be heard if you love me you cant leave me her eyes defied him why not he dropped her hands and rose from her side can you he said sadly the hour was late and the lamp flickered and sank she stood up with a shiver and turned toward the door of her room v at daylight a sound in lydias room woke gannett from a troubled sleep he sat up and listened she was moving about softly as though fearful of disturbing him he heard her push back one of the creaking shutters then there was a moments silence which seemed to indicate that she was waiting to see if the noise had roused him presently she began to move again she had spent a sleepless night probably and was dressing to go down to the garden for a breath of air gannett rose also but some undefinable instinct made his movements as cautious as hers he stole to his window and looked out through the slats of the shutter it had rained in the night and the dawn was gray and lifeless the cloudmuffled hills across the lake were reflected in its surface as in a tarnished mirror in the garden the birds were beginning to shake the drops from the motionless laurustinusboughs an immense pity for lydia filled gannetts soul her seeming intellectual independence had blinded him for a time to the feminine cast of her mind he had never thought of her as a woman who wept and clung there was a lucidity in her intuitions that made them appear to be the result of reasoning now he saw the cruelty he had committed in detaching her from the normal conditions of life he felt too the insight with which she had hit upon the real cause of their suffering their life was impossible as she had said and its worst penalty was that it had made any other life impossible for them even had his love lessened he was bound to her now by a hundred ties of pity and selfreproach and she poor child must turn back to him as latude returned to his cell a new sound startled him it was the stealthy closing of lydias door he crept to his own and heard her footsteps passing down the corridor then he went back to the window and looked out a minute or two later he saw her go down the steps of the porch and enter the garden from his post of observation her face was invisible but something about her appearance struck him she wore a long travelling cloak and under its folds he detected the outline of a bag or bundle he drew a deep breath and stood watching her she walked quickly down the laurustinus alley toward the gate there she paused a moment glancing about the little shady square the stone benches under the trees were empty and she seemed to gather resolution from the solitude about her for she crossed the square to the steamboat landing and he saw her pause before the ticketoffice at the head of the wharf now she was buying her ticket gannett turned his head a moment to look at the clock the boat was due in five minutes he had time to jump into his clothes and overtake her he made no attempt to move an obscure reluctance restrained him if any thought emerged from the tumult of his sensations it was that he must let her go if she wished it he had spoken last night of his rights what were they at the last issue he and she were two separate beings not made one by the miracle of common forbearances duties abnegations but bound together in a noyade of passion that left them resisting yet clinging as they went down after buying her ticket lydia had stood for a moment looking out across the lake then he saw her seat herself on one of the benches near the landing he and she at that moment were both listening for the same sound the whistle of the boat as it rounded the nearest promontory gannett turned again to glance at the clock the boat was due now where would she go what would her life be when she had left him she had no near relations and few friends there was money enough but she asked so much of life in ways so complex and immaterial he thought of her as walking barefooted through a stony waste no one would understand her no one would pity her and he who did both was powerless to come to her aid he saw that she had risen from the bench and walked toward the edge of the lake she stood looking in the direction from which the steamboat was to come then she turned to the ticketoffice doubtless to ask the cause of the delay after that she went back to the bench and sat down with bent head what was she thinking of the whistle sounded she started up and gannett involuntarily made a movement toward the door but he turned back and continued to watch her she stood motionless her eyes on the trail of smoke that preceded the appearance of the boat then the little craft rounded the point a deadwhite object on the leaden water a minute later it was puffing and backing at the wharf the few passengers who were waiting two or three peasants and a snuffy priest were clustered near the ticketoffice lydia stood apart under the trees the boat lay alongside now the gangplank was run out and the peasants went on board with their baskets of vegetables followed by the priest still lydia did not move a bell began to ring querulously there was a shriek of steam and some one must have called to her that she would be late for she started forward as though in answer to a summons she moved waveringly and at the edge of the wharf she paused gannett saw a sailor beckon to her the bell rang again and she stepped upon the gangplank halfway down the short incline to the deck she stopped again then she turned and ran back to the land the gangplank was drawn in the bell ceased to ring and the boat backed out into the lake lydia with slow steps was walking toward the garden as she approached the hotel she looked up furtively and gannett drew back into the room he sat down beside a table a bradshaw lay at his elbow and mechanically without knowing what he did he began looking out the trains to paris a coward my daughter irene said mrs carstyle she made it rhyme with tureen has had no social advantages but if mr carstyle had chosen she paused significantly and looked at the shabby sofa on the opposite side of the fireplace as though it had been mr carstyle vibart was glad that it was not mrs carstyle was one of the women who make refinement vulgar she invariably spoke of her husband as mr carstyle and though she had but one daughter was always careful to designate the young lady by name at luncheon she had talked a great deal of elevating influences and ideals and had fluctuated between apologies for the overdone mutton and affected surprise that the bewildered maidservant should have forgotten to serve the coffee and liqueurs as usual vibart was almost sorry that he had come miss carstyle was still beautiful almost as beautiful as when two days earlier against the leafy background of a june gardenparty he had seen her for the first time but her mothers expositions and elucidations cheapened her beauty as signposts vulgarize a woodland solitude mrs carstyles eye was perpetually plying between her daughter and vibart like an empty cab in quest of a fare miss carstyle the young man decided was the kind of girl whose surroundings rub off on her or was it rather that mrs carstyles idiosyncrasies were of a nature to color every one within reach vibart looking across the table as this consolatory alternative occurred to him was sure that they had not colored mr carstyle but that perhaps was only because they had bleached him instead mr carstyle was quite colorless it would have been impossible to guess his native tint his wifes qualities if they had affected him at all had acted negatively he did not apologize for the mutton and he wandered off after luncheon without pretending to wait for the diurnal coffee and liqueurs while the few remarks that he had contributed to the conversation during the meal had not been in the direction of abstract conceptions of life as he strayed away with his vague oblique step and the stoop that suggested the habit of dodging missiles vibart who was still in the age of formulas found himself wondering what life could be worth to a man who had evidently resigned himself to travelling with his back to the wind so that mrs carstyles allusion to her daughters lack of advantages imparted while irene searched the house for an undiscoverable cigarette had an appositeness unintended by the speaker if mr carstyle had chosen that lady repeated we might have had our city home she never used so small a word as town and ireen could have mixed in the society to which i myself was accustomed at her age her sigh pointed unmistakably to a past when young men had come to luncheon to see her the sigh led vibart to look at her and the look led him to the unwelcome conclusion that irene took after her mother it was certainly not from the sapless paternal stock that the girl had drawn her warm bloom mrs carstyle had contributed the high lights to the picture mrs carstyle caught his look and appropriated it with the complacency of a vicarious beauty she was quite aware of the value of her appearance as guaranteeing irenes development into a fine woman but perhaps she continued taking up the thread of her explanation you have heard of mr carstyles extraordinary hallucination mr carstyle knows that i call it so as i tell him it is the most charitable view to take she looked coldly at the threadbare sofa and indulgently at the young man who filled a corner of it you may think it odd mr vibart that i should take you into my confidence in this way after so short an acquaintance but somehow i cant help regarding you as a friend already i believe in those intuitive sympathies dont you they have never misled me her lids drooped retrospectively and besides i always tell mr carstyle that on this point i will have no false pretences where truth is concerned i am inexorable and i consider it my duty to let our friends know that our restricted way of living is due entirely to choice to mr carstyles choice when i married mr carstyle it was with the expectation of living in new york and of keeping my carriage and there is no reason for our not doing so there is no reason mr vibart why my daughter ireen should have been denied the intellectual advantages of foreign travel i wish that to be understood it is owing to her fathers deliberate choice that ireen and i have been imprisoned in the narrow limits of millbrook society for myself i do not complain if mr carstyle chooses to place others before his wife it is not for his wife to repine his course may be noble quixotic i do not allow myself to pronounce judgment on it though others have thought that in sacrificing his own family to strangers he was violating the most sacred obligations of domestic life this is the opinion of my pastor and of other valued friends but as i have always told them for myself i make no claims where my daughter ireen is concerned it is different it was a relief to vibart when at this point mrs carstyles discharge of her duty was cut short by her daughters reappearance irene had been unable to find a cigarette for mr vibart and her mother with beaming irrelevance suggested that in that case she had better show him the garden the carstyle house stood but a few yards back from the brickpaved millbrook street and the garden was a very small place unless measured as mrs carstyle probably intended that it should be by the extent of her daughters charms these were so considerable that vibart walked back and forward half a dozen times between the porch and the gate before he discovered the limitations of the carstyle domain it was not till irene had accused him of being sarcastic and had confided in him that the girls were furious with her for letting him talk to her so long at his aunts gardenparty that he awoke to the exiguity of his surroundings and then it was with a touch of irritation that he noticed mr carstyles inconspicuous profile bent above a newspaper in one of the lower windows vibart had an idea that mr carstyle while ostensibly reading the paper had kept count of the number of times that his daughter had led her companion up and down between the syringabushes and for some undefinable reason he resented mr carstyles unperturbed observation more than his wifes zealous selfeffacement to a man who is trying to please a pretty girl there are moments when the proximity of an impartial spectator is more disconcerting than the most obvious connivance and something about mr carstyles expression conveyed his goodhumored indifference to irenes processes when the gardengate closed behind vibart he had become aware that his preoccupation with the carstyles had shifted its centre from the daughter to the father but he was accustomed to such emotional surprises and skilled in seizing any compensations they might offer ii the carstyles belonged to the alltheyearround millbrook of papermills cablecars brick pavements and church sociables while mrs vance the aunt with whom vibart lived was an ornament of the summer colony whose big countryhouses dotted the surrounding hills mrs vance had however no difficulty in appeasing the curiosity which mrs carstyles enigmatic utterances had aroused in the young man mrs carstyles relentless veracity vented itself mainly on the summer people as they were called she did not propose that any one within ten miles of millbrook should keep a carriage without knowing that she was entitled to keep one too mrs vance remarked with a sigh that mrs carstyles annual demand to have her position understood came in as punctually as the taxes and the waterrates my dear its simply this when andrew carstyle married her years ago heaven knows why he did hes one of the albany carstyles you know and she was a daughter of old deacon ash of south millbrook well when he married her he had a tidy little income and i suppose the bride expected to set up an establishment in new york and be handinglove with the whole carstyle clan but whether he was ashamed of her from the first or for some other unexplained reason he bought a countryplace and settled down here for life for a few years they lived comfortably enough and she had plenty of smart clothes and drove about in a victoria calling on the summer people then when the beautiful irene was about ten years old mr carstyles only brother died and it turned out that he had made away with a lot of trustproperty it was a horrid business over three hundred thousand dollars were gone and of course most of it had belonged to widows and orphans as soon as the facts were made known andrew carstyle announced that he would pay back what his brother had stolen he sold his countryplace and his wifes carriage and they moved to the little house they live in now mr carstyles income is probably not as large as his wife would like to have it thought and though im told he puts aside a good part of it every year to pay off his brothers obligations i fancy the debt wont be discharged for some time to come to help things along he opened a law office he had studied law in his youth but though he is said to be clever i hear that he has very little to do people are afraid of him hes too dry and quiet nobody believes in a man who doesnt believe in himself and mr carstyle always seems to be winking at you through a slit in his professional manner people dont like it his wife doesnt like it i believe she would have accepted the sacrifice of the countryplace and the carriage if he had struck an attitude and talked about doing his duty it was his regarding the whole thing as a matter of course that exasperated her what is the use of doing something difficult in a way that makes it look perfectly easy i feel sorry for mrs carstyle shes lost her house and her carriage and she hasnt been allowed to be heroic vibart had listened attentively i wonder what miss carstyle thinks of it he mused mrs vance looked at him with a tentative smile i wonder what you think of miss carstyle she returned his answer reassured her i think she takes after her mother he said ah cried his aunt cheerfully then i neednt write to your mother and i can have irene at all my parties miss carstyle was an important factor in the restricted social combinations of a millbrook hostess a local beauty is always a useful addition to a saturdaytomonday houseparty and the beautiful irene was served up as a perennial novelty to the jaded guests of the summer colony as vibarts aunt remarked she was perfect till she became playful and she never became playful till the third day under these conditions it was natural that vibart should see a good deal of the young lady and before he was aware of it he had drifted into the anomalous position of paying court to the daughter in order to ingratiate himself with the father miss carstyle was beautiful vibart was young and the days were long in his aunts spacious and distinguished house but it was really the desire to know something more of mr carstyle that led the young man to partake so often of that gentlemans overdone mutton vibarts imagination had been touched by the discovery that this little huddledup man instead of travelling with the wind was persistently facing a domestic gale of considerable velocity that he should have paid off his brothers debt at one stroke was to the young man a conceivable feat but that he should go on methodically and uninterruptedly accumulating the needed amount under the perpetual accusation of irenes inadequate frocks and mrs carstyles apologies for the mutton seemed to vibart proof of unexampled heroism mr carstyle was as inaccessible as the average american parent and led a life so detached from the preoccupations of his womankind that vibart had some difficulty in fixing his attention to mr carstyle vibart was simply the inevitable young man who had been hanging about the house ever since irene had left school and vibarts efforts to differentiate himself from this enamored abstraction were hampered by mrs carstyles cheerful assumption that he was the young man and by irenes frank appropriation of his visits in this extremity he suddenly observed a slight but significant change in the manner of the two ladies irene instead of charging him with being sarcastic and horrid and declaring herself unable to believe a word he said began to receive his remarks with the impersonal smile which he had seen her accord to the married men of his aunts houseparties while mrs carstyle talking over his head to an invisible but evidently sympathetic and intelligent listener debated the propriety of irenes accepting an invitation to spend the month of august at narragansett when vibart rashly trespassing on the rights of this unseen oracle remarked that a few weeks at the seashore would make a delightful change for miss carstyle the ladies looked at him and then laughed it was at this point that vibart for the first time found himself observed by mr carstyle they were grouped about the debris of a luncheon which had ended precipitously with veal stew mrs carstyle explaining that poor cooks always failed with their sweet dish when there was company and mr carstyle his hands thrust in his pockets his lean baggycoated shoulders pressed against his chairback sat contemplating his guest with a smile of unmistakable approval when vibart caught his eye the smile vanished and mr carstyle dropping his glasses from the bridge of his thin nose looked out of the window with the expression of a man determined to prove an alibi but vibart was sure of the smile it had established between his host and himself a complicity which mr carstyles attempted evasion served only to confirm on the strength of this incident vibart a few days later called at mr carstyles office ostensibly the young man had come to ask on his aunts behalf some question on a point at issue between herself and the millbrook telephone company but his purpose in offering to perform the errand had been the hope of taking up his intercourse with mr carstyle where that gentlemans smile had left it vibart was not disappointed in a dingy office with a single window looking out on a blank wall he found mr carstyle in an alpaca coat reading montaigne it evidently did not occur to him that vibart had come on business and the warmth of his welcome gave the young man a sense of furnishing the last word in a conjugal argument in which for once mr carstyle had come off triumphant the legal question disposed of vibart reverted to montaigne had mr carstyle seen young soandsos volume of essays there was one on montaigne that had a decided flavor the point of view was curious vibart was surprised to find that mr carstyle had heard of young soandso clever young men are given to thinking that their elders have never got beyond macaulay but mr carstyle seemed sufficiently familiar with recent literature not to take it too seriously he accepted vibarts offer of young soandsos volume admitting that his own library was not exactly uptodate vibart went away musing the next day he came back with the volume of essays it seemed to be tacitly understood that he was to call at the office when he wished to see mr carstyle whose legal engagements did not seriously interfere with the pursuit of literature for a week or ten days mrs carstyle in vibarts presence continued to take counsel with her unseen adviser on the subject of her daughters visit to narragansett once or twice irene dropped her impersonal smile to tax vibart with not caring whether she went or not and mrs carstyle seized a moment of t—Ä—îte—Ät—Ä—îte to confide in him that the dear child hated the idea of leaving and was going only because her friend mrs higby would not let her off of course if it had not been for mr carstyles peculiarities they would have had their own seaside home at newport probably mrs carstyle preferred the tone of newport and irene would not have been dependent on the charity of her friends but as it was they must be thankful for small mercies and mrs higby was certainly very kind in her way and had a charming social position for narragansett these confidences however were soon superseded by an exchange between mother and daughter of increasingly frequent allusions to the delights of narragansett the popularity of mrs higby and the jolliness of her house with an occasional reference on mrs carstyles part to the probability of hewlett bains being there as usual hadnt irene heard from mrs higby that he was to be there upon this note miss carstyle at length departed leaving vibart to the undisputed enjoyment of her fathers company vibart had at no time a keen taste for the summer joys of millbrook and the family obligation which for several months of the year kept him at his aunts side mrs vance was a childless widow and he filled the onerous post of favorite nephew gave a sense of compulsion to the light occupations that chequered his leisure mrs vance who fancied herself lonely when he was away was too much engaged with notes telegrams and arriving and departing guests to do more than breathlessly smile upon his presence or implore him to take the dullest girl of the party for a drive and would he go by way of millbrook like a dear and stop at the market to ask why the lobsters hadnt come and the house itself and the guests who came and went in it like people rushing through a railwaystation offered no points of repose to his thoughts some houses are companions in themselves the walls the bookshelves the very chairs and tables have the qualities of a sympathetic mind but mrs vances interior was as impersonal as the setting of a classic drama these conditions made vibart cultivate an assiduous exchange of books between himself and mr carstyle the young man went down almost daily to the little house in the town where mrs carstyle who had now an air of receiving him in curlpapers and of not always immediately distinguishing him from the pianotuner made no effort to detain him on his way to her husbands study iii now and then at the close of one of vibarts visits mr carstyle put on a mildewed panama hat and accompanied the young man for a mile or two on his way home the road to mrs vances lay through one of the most amiable suburbs of millbrook and mr carstyle walking with his slow uneager step his hat pushed back and his stick dragging behind him seemed to take a philosophic pleasure in the aspect of the trim lawns and opulent gardens vibart could never induce his companion to prolong his walk as far as mrs vances drawingroom but one afternoon when the distant hills lay blue beyond the twilight of overarching elms the two men strolled on into the country past that ladys hospitable gateposts it was a still day the road was deserted and every sound came sharply through the air mr carstyle was in the midst of a disquisition on diderot when he raised his head and stood still whats that he said listen vibart listened and heard a distant storm of hoofbeats a moment later a buggy drawn by a pair of trotters swung round the turn of the road it was about thirty yards off coming toward them at full speed the man who drove was leaning forward with outstretched arms beside him sat a girl suddenly vibart saw mr carstyle jump into the middle of the road in front of the buggy he stood there immovable his arms extended his legs apart in an attitude of indomitable resistance almost at the same moment vibart realized that the man in the buggy had his horses in hand theyre not running vibart shouted springing into the road and catching mr carstyles alpaca sleeve the older man looked around vaguely he seemed dazed come away sir come away cried vibart gripping his arm the buggy swept past them and mr carstyle stood in the dust gazing after it at length he drew out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead he was very pale and vibart noticed that his hand shook that was a close call sir wasnt it i suppose you thought they were running yes said mr carstyle slowly i thought they were running it certainly looked like it for a minute lets sit down shall we i feel rather breathless myself vibart saw that his friend could hardly stand they seated themselves on a treetrunk by the roadside and mr carstyle continued to wipe his forehead in silence at length he turned to vibart and said abruptly i made straight for the middle of the road didnt i if there had been a runaway i should have stopped it vibart looked at him in surprise you would have tried to undoubtedly unless id had time to drag you away mr carstyle straightened his narrow shoulders there was no hesitation at all events i i showed no signs of avoiding it i should say not sir it was i who funked it for you mr carstyle was silent his head had dropped forward and he looked like an old man it was just my cursed luck again he exclaimed suddenly in a loud voice for a moment vibart thought that he was wandering but he raised his head and went on speaking in more natural tones i daresay i appeared ridiculous enough to you just now eh perhaps you saw all along that the horses werent running your eyes are younger than mine and then youre not always looking out for runaways as i am do you know that in thirty years ive never seen a runaway youre fortunate said vibart still bewildered fortunate good god man ive prayed to see one not a runaway especially but any bad accident anything that endangered peoples lives there are accidents happening all the time all over the world why shouldnt i ever come across one its not for want of trying at one time i used to haunt the theatres in the hope of a fire fires in theatres are so apt to be fatal well will you believe it i was in the brooklyn theatre the night before it burned down i left the old madison square garden half an hour before the walls fell in and its the same way with street accidents i always miss them im always just too late last year there was a boy knocked down by a cablecar at our corner i got to my gate just as they were carrying him off on a stretcher and so it goes if anybody else had been walking along this road those horses would have been running away and there was a girl in the buggy too a mere child mr carstyles head sank again youre wondering what this means he began after another pause i was a little confused for a moment must have seemed incoherent his voice cleared and he made an effort to straighten himself well i was a damned coward once and ive been trying to live it down ever since vibart looked at him incredulously and mr carstyle caught the look with a smile why not do i look like a hercules he held up his looseskinned hand and shrunken wrist not built for the part certainly but that doesnt count of course mans unconquerable soul and all the rest of it well i was a coward every inch of me body and soul he paused and glanced up and down the road there was no one in sight it happened when i was a young chap just out of college i was travelling round the world with another youngster of my own age and an older man charles meriton who has since made a name for himself you may have heard of him meriton the archaeologist the man who discovered those ruined african cities the other day thats the man he was a college tutor then and my father who had known him since he was a boy and who had a very high opinion of him had asked him to make the tour with us we both my friend collis and i had an immense admiration for meriton he was just the fellow to excite a boys enthusiasm cool quick imperturbable the kind of man whose hand is always on the hilt of action his explorations had led him into all sorts of tight places and hed shown an extraordinary combination of calculating patience and reckless courage he never talked about his doings we picked them up from various people on our journey hed been everywhere he knew everybody and everybody had something stirring to tell about him i daresay this account of the man sounds exaggerated perhaps it is ive never seen him since but at that time he seemed to me a tremendous fellow a kind of scientific ajax he was a capital travellingcompanion at any rate goodtempered cheerful easily amused with none of the beentherebefore superiority so irritating to youngsters he made us feel as though it were all as new to him as to us he never chilled our enthusiasms or took the bloom off our surprises there was nobody else whose good opinion i cared as much about he was the biggest thing in sight on the way home collis broke down with diphtheria we were in the mediterranean cruising about the sporades in a felucca he was taken ill at chios the attack came on suddenly and we were afraid to run the risk of taking him back to athens in the felucca we established ourselves in the inn at chios and there the poor fellow lay for weeks luckily there was a fairly good doctor on the island and we sent to athens for a sister to help with the nursing poor collis was desperately bad the diphtheria was followed by partial paralysis the doctor assured us that the danger was past he would gradually regain the use of his limbs but his recovery would be slow the sister encouraged us too she had seen such cases before and he certainly did improve a shade each day meriton and i had taken turns with the sister in nursing him but after the paralysis had set in there wasnt much to do and there was nothing to prevent meritons leaving us for a day or two he had received word from some place on the coast of asia minor that a remarkable tomb had been discovered somewhere in the interior he had not been willing to take us there as the journey was not a particularly safe one but now that we were tied up at chios there seemed no reason why he shouldnt go and take a look at the place the expedition would not take more than three days collis was convalescent the doctor and nurse assured us that there was no cause for uneasiness and so meriton started off one evening at sunset i walked down to the quay with him and saw him rowed off to the felucca i would have given a good deal to be going with him the prospect of danger allured me youll see that collis is never left alone wont you he shouted back to me as the boat pulled out into the harbor i remembered i rather resented the suggestion i walked back to the inn and went to bed the nurse sat up with collis at night the next morning i relieved her at the usual hour it was a sultry day with a queer copperylooking sky the air was stifling in the middle of the day the nurse came to take my place while i dined when i went back to colliss room she said she would go out for a breath of air i sat down by colliss bed and began to fan him with the fan the sister had been using the heat made him uneasy and i turned him over in bed for he was still helpless the whole of his right side was numb presently he fell asleep and i went to the window and sat looking down on the hot deserted square with a bunch of donkeys and their drivers asleep in the shade of the conventwall across the way i remember noticing the blue beads about the donkeys necks were you ever in an earthquake no id never been in one either its an indescribable sensation theres a day of judgment feeling in the air it began with the donkeys waking up and trembling i noticed that and thought it queer then the drivers jumped up i saw the terror in their faces then a roar i remember noticing a big black crack in the conventwall opposite a zigzag crack like a flash of lightning in a woodcut i thought of that too at the time then all the bells in the place began to ring it made a fearful discord i saw people rushing across the square the air was full of crashing noises the floor went down under me in a sickening way and then jumped back and pitched me to the ceiling but where was the ceiling and the door i said to myself were two stories up the stairs are just wide enough for one i gave one glance at collis he was lying in bed wide awake looking straight at me i ran something struck me on the head as i bolted downstairs i kept on running i suppose the knock i got dazed me for i dont remember much of anything till i found myself in a vineyard a mile from the town i was roused by the warm blood running down my nose and heard myself explaining to meriton exactly how it had happened when i crawled back to the town they told me that all the houses near the inn were in ruins and that a dozen people had been killed collis was among them of course the ceiling had come down on him mr carstyle wiped his forehead vibart sat looking away from him two days later meriton came back i began to tell him the story but he interrupted me there was no one with him at the time then youd left him alone no he wasnt alone who was with him you said the sister was out i was with him you were with him i shall never forget meritons look i believe i had meant to explain to accuse myself to shout out my agony of soul but i saw the uselessness of it a door had been shut between us neither of us spoke another word he was very kind to me on the way home he looked after me in a motherly way that was a good deal harder to stand than his open contempt i saw the man was honestly trying to pity me but it was no good he simply couldnt mr carstyle rose slowly with a certain stiffness shall we turn toward home perhaps im keeping you they walked on a few steps in silence then he spoke again that business altered my whole life of course i oughtnt to have allowed it to that was another form of cowardice but i saw myself only with meritons eyes it is one of the worst miseries of youth that one is always trying to be somebody else i had meant to be a meriton i saw id better go home and study law its a childish fancy a survival of the primitive savage if you like but from that hour to this ive hankered day and night for a chance to retrieve myself to set myself right with the man i meant to be i want to prove to that man that it was all an accident an unaccountable deviation from my normal instincts that having once been a coward doesnt mean that a mans cowardly and i cant i cant mr carstyles tone had passed insensibly from agitation to irony he had got back to his usual objective standpoint why im a perfect olivebranch he concluded with his dry indulgent laugh the very babies stop crying at my approach i carry a sort of millennium about with me id make my fortune as an agent of the peace society i shall go to the grave leaving that other man unconvinced vibart walked back with him to millbrook on her doorstep they met mrs carstyle flushed and feathered with a cardcase and dusty boots i dont ask you in she said plaintively to vibart because i cant answer for the food this evening my maidofallwork tells me that shes going to a ball which is more than ive done in years and besides it would be cruel to ask you to spend such a hot evening in our stuffy little house the air is so much cooler at mrs vances remember me to mrs vance please and tell her how sorry i am that i can no longer include her in my round of visits when i had my carriage i saw the people i liked but now that i have to walk my social opportunities are more limited i was not obliged to do my visiting on foot when i was younger and my doctor tells me that to persons accustomed to a carriage no exercise is more injurious than walking she glanced at her husband with a smile of unforgiving sweetness fortunately she concluded it agrees with mr carstyle the twilight of the god i a newport drawingroom tapestries flowers bricabrac through the windows a geraniumedged lawn the cliffs and the sea isabel warland sits reading lucius warland enters in flannels and a yachtingcap isabel back already warland the wind dropped it turned into a drifting race langham took me off the yacht on his launch what time is it two oclock wheres mrs raynor isabel on her way to new york warland to new york isabel precisely the boat must be just leaving she started an hour ago and took laura with her in fact im alone in the house that is until this evening some people are coming then warland but what in the world isabel her aunt mrs griscom has had a fit she has them constantly theyre not serious at least they wouldnt be if mrs griscom were not so rich and childless naturally under the circumstances marian feels a peculiar sympathy for her her position is such a sad one theres positively no one to care whether she lives or dies except her heirs of course they all rush to newburgh whenever she has a fit its hard on marian for she lives the farthest away but she has come to an understanding with the housekeeper who always telegraphs her first so that she gets a start of several hours she will be at newburgh tonight at ten and she has calculated that the others cant possibly arrive before midnight warland you have a delightful way of putting things i suppose youd talk of me like that isabel oh no its too humiliating to doubt ones husbands disinterestedness warland i wish i had a rich aunt who had fits isabel if i were wishing i should choose heartdisease warland theres no doing anything without money or influence isabel picking up her book have you heard from washington warland yes thats what i was going to speak of when i asked for mrs raynor i wanted to bid her goodbye isabel youre going warland by the five train fagott has just wired me that the ambassador will be in washington on monday he hasnt named his secretaries yet but there isnt much hope for me he has a nephew isabel they always have like the popes warland well im going all the same youll explain to mrs raynor if she gets back before i do are there to be people at dinner i dont suppose it matters you can always pick up an extra man on a saturday isabel by the way that reminds me that marian left me a list of the people who are arriving this afternoon my novel is so absorbing that i forgot to look at it where can it be ah here let me see the jack merringtons adelaide clinton ned lender all from new york by seven pm train lewis darley tonight by fall river boat john oberville from boston at five pm why i didnt know warland excitedly john oberville john oberville here today at five oclock let me see let me look at the list are you sure youre not mistaken why she never said a word why the deuce didnt you tell me isabel i didnt know warland oberville oberville isabel why what difference does it make warland what difference what difference dont look at me as if you didnt understand english why if obervilles coming a pause look here isabel didnt you know him very well at one time isabel very well yes warland i thought so of course i remember now i heard all about it before i met you let me see didnt you and your mother spend a winter in washington when he was undersecretary of state isabel that was before the deluge warland i remember it all comes back to me i used to hear it said that he admired you tremendously there was a report that you were engaged dont you remember why it was in all the papers by jove isabel what a match that would have been isabel you are disinterested warland well i cant help thinking isabel that i paid you a handsome compliment warland preoccupied eh ah yes exactly what was i saying oh about the report of your engagement playfully he was awfully gone on you wasnt he isabel its not for me to diminish your triumph warland by jove i cant think why mrs raynor didnt tell me he was coming a man like that one doesnt take him for granted like the pianotuner i wonder i didnt see it in the papers isabel is he grown such a great man warland oberville great john oberville ill tell you what he is the power behind the throne the black pope the kingmaker and all the rest of it dont you read the papers of course ill never get on if you wont interest yourself in politics and to think you might have married that man isabel and got you your secretaryship warland oberville has them all in the hollow of his hand isabel well youll see him at five oclock warland i dont suppose hes ever heard of me worse luck a silence isabel look here i never ask questions do i but it was so long ago and oberville almost belongs to history he will one of these days at any rate just tell me did he want to marry you isabel since you answer for his immortality after a pause i was very much in love with him warland then of course he did another pause but what in the world isabel musing as you say it was so long ago i dont see why i shouldnt tell you there was a married woman who had what is the correct expression made sacrifices for him there was only one sacrifice she objected to making and he didnt consider himself free it sounds rather rococo doesnt it it was odd that she died the year after we were married warland whew isabel following her own thoughts ive never seen him since it must be ten years ago im certainly thirtytwo and i was just twentytwo then its curious to talk of it i had put it away so carefully how it smells of camphor and what an oldfashioned cut it has rising wheres the list lucius you wanted to know if there were to be people at dinner tonight warland here it is but never mind isabel silence isabel isabel well warland its odd he never married isabel the comparison is to my disadvantage but then i met you warland dont be so confoundedly sarcastic i wonder how hell feel about seeing you oh i dont mean any sentimental rot of course but youre an uncommonly agreeable woman i daresay hell be pleased to see you again youre fifty times more attractive than when i married you isabel i wish your other investments had appreciated at the same rate unfortunately my charms wont pay the butcher warland damn the butcher isabel i happened to mention him because hes just written again but i might as well have said the baker or the candlestickmaker the candlestickmaker i wonder what he is by the way he must have more faith in human nature than the others for i havent heard from him yet i wonder if there is a creditors polite letterwriter which they all consult their style is so exactly alike i advise you to pass through new york incognito on your way to washington their attentions might be oppressive warland confoundedly oppressive what a dogs life it is my poor isabel isabel dont pity me i didnt marry yon for a home warland after a pause what did you marry me for if you cared for oberville another pause eh isabel dont make me regret my confidence warland i beg your pardon isabel oh it was only a subterfuge to conceal the fact that i have no distinct recollection of my reasons the fact is a girls motives in marrying are like a passport apt to get mislaid one is so seldom asked for either but mine certainly couldnt have been mercenary i never heard a mother praise you to her daughters warland no i never was much of a match isabel you impugn my judgment warland if i only had a head for business now i might have done something by this time but id sooner break stones in the road isabel it must be very hard to get an opening in that profession so many of my friends have aspired to it and yet i never knew any one who actually did it warland if i could only get the secretaryship how that kind of life would suit you its as much for you that i want it isabel and almost as much for the butcher dont belittle the circle of your benevolence she walks across the room three oclock already and marian asked me to give orders about the carriages let me see mr oberville is the first arrival if youll ring i will send word to the stable i suppose youll stay now warland stay isabel not go to washington i thought you spoke as if he could help you warland he could settle the whole thing in five minutes the president cant refuse him anything but he doesnt know me he may have a candidate of his own its a pity you havent seen him for so long and yet i dont know perhaps its just as well the others dont arrive till seven it seems as if how long is he going to be here till tomorrow night i suppose i wonder what hes come for the merringtons will bore him to death and adelaide of course will be philandering with lender i wonder a pause if darley likes boating rings the bell isabel boating warland oh i was only thinking where are the matches one may smoke here i suppose he looks at his wife if i were you id put on that black gown of yours tonight the one with the spangles its only that fred langham asked me to go over to narragansett in his launch tomorrow morning and i was thinking that i might take darley i always liked darley isabel to the footman who enters mrs raynor wishes the dogcart sent to the station at five oclock to meet mr oberville footman

dinnertime footman very good mm here are some letters mm isabel glancing at them with a movement of disgust you may send them up to my room footman i beg pardon mm but one is a note from mme

face ah after a moment she rises taking up her gloves and sunshade and walks toward the window which opens on the lawn im so tired she hesitates and turns back into the room where can i go to she sits down again by the teatable and bends over the kettle the clock strikes halfpast five isabel picking up her sunshade walks back to the window if i must meet one of them oberville speaking in the hall thanks ill take tea first he enters the room and pauses doubtfully on seeing isabel isabel stepping towards him with a smile its not that ive changed of course but only that i happened to have my back to the light isnt that what you are going to say oberville mrs warland isabel so you really have become a great man they always remember peoples names oberville were you afraid i was going to call you isabel isabel bravo crescendo oberville but you have changed all the same isabel you must indeed have reached a dizzy eminence since you can indulge yourself by speaking the truth oberville its your voice i knew it at once and yet its different isabel i hope it can still convey the pleasure i feel in seeing an old friend she holds out her hand he takes it you know i suppose that mrs raynor is not here to receive you she was called away this morning very suddenly by her aunts illness oberville yes she left a note for me absently im sorry to hear of mrs griscoms illness isabel oh mrs griscoms illnesses are less alarming than her recoveries but i am forgetting to offer you any tea she hands him a cup i remember you liked it very strong oberville what else do you remember isabel a number of equally useless things my mind is a storeroom of obsolete information oberville why obsolete since i am providing you with a use for it isabel at any rate its open to question whether it was worth storing for that length of time especially as there must have been others more fitted by opportunity to undertake the duty oberville the duty isabel of remembering how you like your tea oberville with a change of tone since you call it a duty i may remind you that its one i have never asked any one else to perform isabel as a duty but as a pleasure oberville do you really want to know isabel oh i dont require and charge you oberville you dislike as much as ever having the is dotted isabel with a handwriting i know as well as yours oberville recovering his lightness of manner accomplished woman he examines her approvingly id no idea that you were here i never was more surprised isabel i hope you like being surprised to my mind its an overrated pleasure oberville is it im sorry to hear that isabel why have you a surprise to dispose of oberville im not sure that i havent isabel dont part with it too hastily it may improve by being kept oberville tentatively does that mean that you dont want it isabel heaven forbid i want everything i can get oberville and you get everything you want at least you used to isabel let us talk of your surprise oberville its to be yours you know a pause he speaks gravely i find that ive never got over having lost you isabel also gravely and is that a surprise to you too oberville honestly yes i thought id crammed my life full i didnt know there was a

talking stupidly isabel it would be odious if you were eloquent oberville what do you mean isabel thats a question you never used to ask me oberville be merciful remember how little practise ive had lately isabel in what oberville never mind he rises and walks away then comes back and stands in front of her what a fool i was to give you up isabel oh dont say that ive lived on it oberville on my letting you go isabel on your letting everything go but the right oberville oh hang the right what is truth we had the right to be happy isabel with rising emotion i used to think so sometimes oberville did you triple fool that i was isabel but you showed me oberville why good god we belonged to each other and i let you go its fabulous ive fought for things since that werent worth a crooked sixpence fought as well as other men and you you i lost you because i couldnt face a scene hang it suppose thered been a dozen scenes i might have survived them men have been known to theyre not necessarily fatal isabel a scene oberville its a form of fear that women dont understand how you must have despised me isabel you were afraid of a scene oberville i was a damned coward isabel thats about the size of it isabel ah i had thought it so much larger oberville what did you say isabel i said that you have forgotten to drink your tea it must be quite cold oberville ah isabel let me give you another cup oberville collecting himself no no this is perfect isabel you havent tasted it oberville falling into her mood you always made it to perfection only you never gave me enough sugar isabel i know better now she puts another lump in his cup oberville drinks his tea and then says with an air of reproach isnt all this chaff rather a waste of time between two old friends who havent met for so many years isabel lightly oh its only a hors doeuvre the tuning of the instruments im out of practise too oberville let us come to the grand air then sits down near her tell me about yourself what are you doing isabel at this moment youll never guess im trying to remember you oberville to remember me isabel until you came into the room just now my recollection of you was so vivid you were a living whole in my thoughts now i am engaged in gathering up the fragments in laboriously reconstructing you oberville i have changed so much then isabel no i dont believe that youve changed its only that i see you differently dont you know how hard it is to convince elderly people that the type of the evening paper is no smaller than when they were young oberville ive shrunk then isabel you couldnt have grown bigger oh im serious now you neednt prepare a smile for years you were the tallest object on my horizon i used to climb to the thought of you as people who live in a flat country mount the church steeple for a view its wonderful how much i used to see from there and the air was so strong and pure oberville and now isabel now i can fancy how delightful it must be to sit next to you at dinner oberville youre unmerciful have i said anything to offend you isabel of course not how absurd oberville i lost my head a little i forgot how long it is since we have met when i saw you i forgot everything except what you had once been to me she is silent i thought you too generous to resent that perhaps i have overtaxed your generosity a pause shall i confess it when i first saw you i thought for a moment that you had remembered as i had you see i can only excuse myself by saying something inexcusable isabel deliberately not inexcusable oberville not isabel i had remembered oberville isabel isabel but now oberville ah give me a moment before you unsay it isabel i dont mean to unsay it theres no use in repealing an obsolete law thats the pity of it you say you lost me ten years ago a pause i never lost you till now oberville now isabel only this morning you were my supreme court of justice there was no appeal from your verdict not an hour ago you decided a case for me against myself and now and the worst of it is that its not because youve changed how do i know if youve changed you havent said a hundred words to me you havent been an hour in the room and the years must have enriched you i daresay youve doubled your capital youve been in the thick of life and the metal youre made of brightens with use success on some men looks like a borrowed coat it sits on you as though it had been made to order i see all this i know it but i dont feel it i dont feel anything anywhere im numb a pause dont laugh but i really dont think i should know now if you came into the room unless i actually saw you they are both silent oberville at length then to put the most merciful interpretation upon your epigrams your feeling for me was made out of poorer stuff than mine for you isabel perhaps it has had harder wear oberville or been less cared for isabel if one has only one cloak one must wear it in all weathers oberville unless it is so beautiful and precious that one prefers to go cold and keep it under lock and key isabel in the cedarchest of indifference the key of which is usually lost oberville ah isabel youre too pat how much i preferred your hesitations isabel my hesitations that reminds me how much your coming has simplified things i feel as if id had an auction sale of fallacies oberville you speak in enigmas and i have a notion that your riddles are the reverse of the sphinxs more dangerous to guess than to give up and yet i used to find your thoughts such good reading isabel one cares so little for the style in which ones praises are written oberville youve been praising me for the last ten minutes and i find your style detestable i would rather have you find fault with me like a friend than approve me like a dilettante isabel a dilettante the very word i wanted oberville i am proud to have enriched so full a vocabulary but i am still waiting for the word i want he grows serious isabel look in your heart give me the first word you find there youve no idea how much a beggar can buy with a penny isabel its empty my poor friend its empty oberville beggars never say that to each other isabel no never unless its true oberville after another silence why do you look at me so curiously isabel im what was it you said approving you as a dilettante dont be alarmed you can bear examination i dont see a crack anywhere after all its a satisfaction to find that ones idol makes a handsome bibelot oberville with an attempt at lightness i was right then youre a collector isabel modestly one must make a beginning i think i shall begin with you she smiles at him positively i must have you on my mantelshelf she rises and looks at the clock but its time to dress for dinner she holds out her hand to him and he kisses it they look at each other and it is clear that he does not quite understand but is watching eagerly for his cue warland coming in hullo isabel youre here after all isabel and so is mr oberville she looks straight at warland i stayed in on purpose to meet him my husband the two men bow warland effusively so glad to meet you my wife talks of you so often shes been looking forward tremendously to your visit oberville its a long time since ive had the pleasure of seeing mrs warland isabel but now we are going to make up for lost time as he goes to the door i claim you tomorrow for the whole day oberville bows and goes out isabel lucius i think youd better go to washington after all musing narragansett might do for the others though couldnt you get fred langham to ask all the rest of the party to go over there with him tomorrow morning i shall have a headache and stay at home he looks at her doubtfully mr oberville is a bad sailor warland advances demonstratively isabel drawing back its time to go and dress i think you said the black gown with spangles a cup of cold water it was three oclock in the morning and the cotillion was at its height when woburn left the overheated splendor of the gildermere ballroom and after a delay caused by the determination of the drowsy footman to give him a readymade overcoat with an imitation astrachan collar in place of his own unimpeachable poole garment found himself breasting the icy solitude of the fifth avenue he was still smiling as he emerged from the awning at his insistence in claiming his own overcoat it illustrated humorously enough the invincible force of habit as he faced the wind however he discerned a providence in his persistency for his coat was furlined and he had a cold voyage before him on the morrow it had rained hard during the earlier part of the night and the carriages waiting in triple line before the gildermeres door were still domed by shining umbrellas while the electric lamps extending down the avenue blinked narcissuslike at their watery images in the hollows of the sidewalk a dry blast had come out of the north with pledge of frost before daylight and to woburns shivering fancy the pools in the pavement seemed already stiffening into ice he turned up his coatcollar and stepped out rapidly his hands deep in his coatpockets as he walked he glanced curiously up at the ladderlike doorsteps which may well suggest to the future archaeologist that all the streets of new york were once canals at the spectral tracery of the trees about st lukes the fretted mass of the cathedral and the mean vista of the long sidestreets the knowledge that he was perhaps looking at it all for the last time caused every detail to start out like a challenge to memory and lit the brownstone housefronts with the glamor of swordbarred edens it was an odd impulse that had led him that night to the gildermere ball but the same change in his condition which made him stare wonderingly at the houses in the fifth avenue gave the thrill of an exploit to the tame business of ballgoing who would have imagined woburn mused that such a situation as his would possess the priceless quality of sharpening the blunt edge of habit it was certainly curious to reflect as he leaned against the doorway of mrs gildermeres ballroom enveloped in the warm atmosphere of the accustomed that twentyfour hours later the people brushing by him with looks of friendly recognition would start at the thought of having seen him and slur over the recollection of having taken his hand and the girl he had gone there to see what would she think of him he knew well enough that her trenchant classifications of life admitted no overlapping of good and evil made no allowance for that incalculable interplay of motives that justifies the subtlest casuistry of compassion miss talcott was too young to distinguish the intermediate tints of the moral spectrum and her judgments were further simplified by a peculiar concreteness of mind her bringingup had fostered this tendency and she was surrounded by people who focussed life in the same way to the girls in miss talcotts set the attentions of a clever man who had to work for his living had the zest of a forbidden pleasure but to marry such a man would be as unpardonable as to have ones carriage seen at the door of a cheap dressmaker poverty might make a man fascinating but a settled income was the best evidence of stability of character if there were anything in heredity how could a nice girl trust a man whose parents had been careless enough to leave him unprovided for neither miss talcott nor any of her friends could be charged with formulating these views but they were implicit in the slope of every white shoulder and in the ripple of every yard of imported tulle dappling the foreground of mrs gildermeres ballroom the advantages of line and colour in veiling the crudities of a creed are obvious to emotional minds and besides woburn was conscious that it was to the cheerful materialism of their parents that the young girls he admired owed that fine distinction of outline in which their skilfullyrippled hair and skilfullyhung draperies co—Åperated with the slimness and erectness that came of participating in the most expensive sports eating the most expensive food and breathing the most expensive air since the process which had produced them was so costly how could they help being costly themselves woburn was too logical to expect to give no more for a piece of old s—Ä—ëvres than for a bit of kitchen crockery he had no faith in wonderful bargains and believed that one got in life just what one was willing to pay for he had no mind to dispute the taste of those who preferred the rustic simplicity of the earthen crock but his own fancy inclined to the piece of p—Ä—ñte tendre which must be kept in a glass case and handled as delicately as a flower it was not merely by the external grace of these drawingroom ornaments that woburns sensibilities were charmed his imagination was touched by the curious exoticism of view resulting from such conditions he had always enjoyed listening to miss talcott even more than looking at her her ideas had the brilliant bloom and audacious irrelevance of those tropical orchids which strike root in air miss talcotts opinions had no connection with the actual her very materialism had the grace of artificiality woburn had been enchanted once by seeing her helpless before a smoking lamp she had been obliged to ring for a servant because she did not know how to put it out her supreme charm was the simplicity that comes of taking it for granted that people are born with carriages and countryplaces it never occurred to her that such congenital attributes could be matter for selfconsciousness and she had none of the nouveau riche prudery which classes poverty with the nude in art and is not sure how to behave in the presence of either the conditions of woburns own life had made him peculiarly susceptible to those forms of elegance which are the flower of ease his father had lost a comfortable property through sheer inability to go over his agents accounts and this disaster coming at the outset of woburns schooldays had given a new bent to the family temperament the father characteristically died when the effort of living might have made it possible to retrieve his fortunes and woburns mother and sister embittered by this final evasion settled down to a vindictive war with circumstances they were the kind of women who think that it lightens the burden of life to throw over the amenities as a reduced housekeeper puts away her knickknacks to make the dusting easier they fought mean conditions meanly but woburn in his resentment of their attitude did not allow for the suffering which had brought it about his own tendency was to overcome difficulties by conciliation rather than by conflict such surroundings threw into vivid relief the charming figure of miss talcott woburn instinctively associated poverty with bad food ugly furniture complaints and recriminations it was natural that he should be drawn toward the luminous atmosphere where life was a series of peaceful and goodhumored acts unimpeded by petty obstacles to spend ones time in such society gave one the illusion of unlimited credit and also unhappily created the need for it it was here in fact that woburns difficulties began to marry miss talcott it was necessary to be a rich man even to dine out in her set involved certain minor extravagances woburn had determined to marry her sooner or later and in the meanwhile to be with her as much as possible as he stood leaning in the doorway of the gildermere ballroom watching her pass him in the waltz he tried to remember how it had begun first there had been the tailors bill the furlined overcoat with cuffs and collar of alaska sable had alone cost more than he had spent on his clothes for two or three years previously then there were theatretickets cabfares florists bills tips to servants at the countryhouses where he went because he knew that she was invited the omar khayy—Äm bound by sullivan that he sent her at christmas the contributions to her pet charities the reckless purchases at fairs where she had a stall his whole way of life had imperceptibly changed and his years salary was gone before the second quarter was due he had invested the few thousand dollars which had been his portion of his fathers shrunken estate when his debts began to pile up he took a flyer in stocks and after a few months of varying luck his little patrimony disappeared meanwhile his courtship was proceeding at an inverse ratio to his financial ventures miss talcott was growing tender and he began to feel that the game was in his hands the nearness of the goal exasperated him she was not the girl to wait and he knew that it must be now or never a friend lent him five thousand dollars on his personal note and he bought railway stocks on margin they went up and he held them for a higher rise they fluctuated dragged dropped below the level at which he had bought and slowly continued their uninterrupted descent his broker called for more margin he could not respond and was sold out what followed came about quite naturally for several years he had been cashier in a wellknown bankinghouse when the note he had given his friend became due it was obviously necessary to pay it and he used the firms money for the purpose to repay the money thus taken he increased his debt to his employers and bought more stocks and on these operations he made a profit of ten thousand dollars miss talcott rode in the park and he bought a smart hack for seven hundred paid off his tradesmen and went on speculating with the remainder of his profits he made a little more but failed to take advantage of the market and lost all that he had staked including the amount taken from the firm he increased his overdraft by another ten thousand and lost that he overdrew a farther sum and lost again suddenly he woke to the fact that he owed his employers fifty thousand dollars and that the partners were to make their semiannual inspection in two days he realized then that within fortyeight hours what he had called borrowing would become theft there was no time to be lost he must clear out and start life over again somewhere else the day that he reached this decision he was to have met miss talcott at dinner he went to the dinner but she did not appear she had a headache his hostess explained well he was not to have a last look at her after all better so perhaps he took leave early and on his way home stopped at a florists and sent her a bunch of violets the next morning he got a little note from her the violets had done her head so much good she would tell him all about it that evening at the gildermere ball woburn laughed and tossed the note into the fire that evening he would be on board ship the examination of the books was to take place the following morning at ten woburn went down to the bank as usual he did not want to do anything that might excite suspicion as to his plans and from one or two questions which one of the partners had lately put to him he divined that he was being observed at the bank the day passed uneventfully he discharged his business with his accustomed care and went uptown at the usual hour in the first flush of his successful speculations he had set up bachelor lodgings moved by the temptation to get away from the dismal atmosphere of home from his mothers struggles with the cook and his sisters curiosity about his letters he had been influenced also by the wish for surroundings more adapted to his tastes he wanted to be able to give little teas to which miss talcott might come with a married friend she came once or twice and pronounced it all delightful she thought it so nice to have only a few whistler etchings on the walls and the simplest crushed levant for all ones books to these rooms woburn returned on leaving the bank his plans had taken definite shape he had engaged passage on a steamer sailing for halifax early the next morning and there was nothing for him to do before going on board but to pack his clothes and tear up a few letters he threw his clothes into a couple of portmanteaux and when these had been called for by an expressman he emptied his pockets and counted up his ready money he found that he possessed just fifty dollars and seventyfive cents but his passage to halifax was paid and once there he could pawn his watch and rings this calculation completed he unlocked his writingtable drawer and took out a handful of letters they were notes from miss talcott he read them over and threw them into the fire on his table stood her photograph he slipped it out of its frame and tossed it on top of the blazing letters having performed this rite he got into his dressclothes and went to a small french restaurant to dine he had meant to go on board the steamer immediately after dinner but a sudden vision of introspective hours in a silent cabin made him call for the evening paper and run his eye over the list of theatres it would be as easy to go on board at midnight as now he selected a new vaudeville and listened to it with surprising freshness of interest but toward eleven oclock he again began to dread the approaching necessity of going down to the steamer there was something peculiarly unnerving in the idea of spending the rest of the night in a stifling cabin jammed against the side of a wharf he left the theatre and strolled across to the fifth avenue it was now nearly midnight and a stream of carriages poured up town from the opera and the theatres as he stood on the corner watching the familiar spectacle it occurred to him that many of the people driving by him in smart broughams and cspring landaus were on their way to the gildermere ball he remembered miss talcotts note of the morning and wondered if she were in one of the passing carriages she had spoken so confidently of meeting him at the ball what if he should go and take a last look at her there was really nothing to prevent it he was not likely to run across any member of the firm in miss talcotts set his social standing was good for another ten hours at least he smiled in anticipation of her surprise at seeing him and then reflected with a start that she would not be surprised at all his meditations were cut short by a fall of sleety rain and hailing a hansom he gave the driver mrs gildermeres address as he drove up the avenue he looked about him like a traveller in a strange city the buildings which had been so unobtrusively familiar stood out with sudden distinctness he noticed a hundred details which had escaped his observation the people on the sidewalks looked like strangers he wondered where they were going and tried to picture the lives they led but his own relation to life had been so suddenly reversed that he found it impossible to recover his mental perspective at one corner he saw a shabby man lurking in the shadow of the side street as the hansom passed a policeman ordered him to move on farther on woburn noticed a woman crouching on the doorstep of a handsome house she had drawn a shawl over her head and was sunk in the apathy of despair or drink a welldressed couple paused to look at her the electric globe at the corner lit up their faces and woburn saw the lady who was young and pretty turn away with a little grimace drawing her companion after her the desire to see miss talcott had driven woburn to the gildermeres but once in the ballroom he made no effort to find her the people about him seemed more like strangers than those he had passed in the street he stood in the doorway studying the petty manoeuvres of the women and the resigned amenities of their partners was it possible that these were his friends these mincing women all paint and dye and whalebone these apathetic men who looked as much alike as the figures that children cut out of a folded sheet of paper was it to live among such puppets that he had sold his soul what had any of these people done that was noble exceptional distinguished who knew them by name even except their tradesmen and the society reporters who were they that they should sit in judgment on him the bald man with the globular stomach who stood at mrs gildermeres elbow surveying the dancers was old boylston who had made his pile in wrecking railroads the smooth chap with glazed eyes at whom a pretty girl smiled up so confidingly was collerton the political lawyer who had been mixed up to his own advantage in an ugly lobbying transaction near him stood brice lyndham whose recent failure had ruined his friends and associates but had not visibly affected the welfare of his large and expensive family the slim fellow dancing with miss gildermere was alec vance who lived on a salary of five thousand a year but whose wife was such a good manager that they kept a brougham and victoria and always put in their season at newport and their spring trip to europe the little ferretfaced youth in the corner was regie colby who wrote the entrenous paragraphs in the social searchlight the women were charming to him and he got all the financial tips he wanted from their husbands and fathers and the women well the women knew all about the men and flattered them and married them and tried to catch them for their daughters it was a dominoparty at which the guests were forbidden to unmask though they all saw through each others disguises and these were the people who within twentyfour hours would be agreeing that they had always felt there was something wrong about woburn they would be extremely sorry for him of course poor devil but there are certain standards after all what would society be without standards his new friends his future associates were the suspiciouslooking man whom the policeman had ordered to move on and the drunken woman asleep on the doorstep to these he was linked by the freemasonry of failure miss talcott passed him on collertons arm she was giving him one of the smiles of which woburn had fancied himself sole owner collerton was a sharp fellow he must have made a lot in that last deal probably she would marry him how much did she know about the transaction she was a shrewd girl and her father was in wall street if woburns luck had turned the other way she might have married him instead and if he had confessed his sin to her one evening as they drove home from the opera in their new brougham she would have said that really it was of no use to tell her for she never could understand about business but that she did entreat him in future to be nicer to regie colby even now if he made a big strike somewhere and came back in ten years with a beard and a steam yacht they would all deny that anything had been proved against him and mrs collerton might blush and remind him of their friendship well why not was not all morality based on a convention what was the stanchest code of ethics but a trunk with a series of false bottoms now and then one had the illusion of getting down to absolute right or wrong but it was only a false bottom a removable hypothesis with another false bottom underneath there was no getting beyond the relative the cotillion had begun miss talcott sat nearly opposite him she was dancing with young boylston and giving him a woburncollerton smile so young boylston was in the syndicate too presently woburn was aware that she had forgotten young boylston and was glancing absently about the room she was looking for some one and meant the some one to know it he knew that lostchord look in her eyes a new figure was being formed the partners circled about the room and miss talcotts flying tulle drifted close to him as she passed then the favors were distributed white skirts wavered across the floor like thistledown on summer air men rose from their seats and fresh couples filled the shining parquet miss talcott after taking from the basket a legion of honor in red enamel surveyed the room for a moment then she made her way through the dancers and held out the favor to woburn he fastened it in his coat and emerging from the crowd of men about the doorway slipped his arm about her their eyes met hers were serious and a little sad how fine and slender she was he noticed the little tendrils of hair about the pink convolution of her ear her waist was firm and yet elastic she breathed calmly and regularly as though dancing were her natural motion she did not look at him again and neither of them spoke when the music ceased they paused near her chair her partner was waiting for her and woburn left her with a bow he made his way downstairs and out of the house he was glad that he had not spoken to miss talcott there had been a healing power in their silence all bitterness had gone from him and he thought of her now quite simply as the girl he loved at thirtyfifth street he reflected that he had better jump into a car and go down to his steamer again there rose before him the repulsive vision of the dark cabin with creaking noises overhead and the cold wash of water against the pier he thought he would stop in a caf—Ä and take a drink he turned into broadway and entered a brightlylit caf—Ä but when he had taken his whisky and soda there seemed no reason for lingering he had never been the kind of man who could escape difficulties in that way yet he was conscious that his will was weakening that he did not mean to go down to the steamer just yet what did he mean to do he began to feel horribly tired and it occurred to him that a few hours sleep in a decent bed would make a new man of him why not go on board the next morning at daylight he could not go back to his rooms for on leaving the house he had taken the precaution of dropping his latchkey into his letterbox but he was in a neighborhood of discreet hotels and he wandered on till he came to one which was known to offer a dispassionate hospitality to luggageless travellers in dressclothes ii he pushed open the swinging door and found himself in a long corridor with a tessellated floor at the end of which in a brightlylit enclosure of plateglass and mahogany the nightclerk dozed over a copy of the police gazette the air in the corridor was rich in reminiscences of yesterdays dinners and a bronzed radiator poured a wave of dry heat into woburns face the nightclerk roused by the swinging of the door sat watching woburns approach with the unexpectant eye of one who has full confidence in his capacity for digesting surprises not that there was anything surprising in woburns appearance but the nightclerks callers were given to such imaginative flights in explaining their luggageless arrival in the small hours of the morning that he fared habitually on fictions which would have staggered a less experienced stomach the nightclerk whose unwrinkled bloom showed that he throve on this highseasoned diet had a fancy for classifying his applicants before they could frame their explanations this ones been locked out he said to himself as he mustered woburn having exercised his powers of divination with his accustomed accuracy he listened without stirring an eyelid to woburns statement merely replying when the latter asked the price of a room twofifty very well said woburn pushing the money under the brass lattice ill go up at once and i want to be called at seven to this the nightclerk proffered no reply but stretching out his hand to press an electric button returned apathetically to the perusal of the police gazette his summons was answered by the appearance of a man in shirtsleeves whose rumpled head indicated that he had recently risen from some kind of makeshift repose to him the nightclerk tossed a key with the brief comment ninetyseven and the man after a sleepy glance at woburn turned on his heel and lounged toward the staircase at the back of the corridor woburn followed and they climbed three flights in silence at each landing woburn glanced down the long passageway lit by a lowered gasjet with a double line of boots before the doors waiting like yesterdays deeds to carry their owners so many miles farther on the morrows destined road on the third landing the man paused and after examining the number on the key turned to the left and slouching past three or four doors finally unlocked one and preceded woburn into a room lit only by the upward gleam of the electric globes in the street below the man felt in his pockets then he turned to woburn got a match he asked woburn politely offered him one and he applied it to the gasfixture which extended its jointed arm above an ash dressingtable with a blurred mirror fixed between two standards having performed this office with an air of detachment designed to make woburn recognize it as an act of supererogation he turned without a word and vanished down the passageway woburn after an indifferent glance about the room which seemed to afford the amount of luxury generally obtainable for two dollars and a half in a fashionable quarter of new york locked the door and sat down at the inkstained writingtable in the window far below him lay the pallidlylit depths of the forsaken thoroughfare now and then he heard the jingle of a horsecar and the ring of hoofs on the freezing pavement or saw the lonely figure of a policeman eclipsing the illumination of the plateglass windows on the opposite side of the street he sat thus for a long time his elbows on the table his chin between his hands till at length the contemplation of the abandoned sidewalks above which the electric globes kept styliteslike vigil became intolerable to him and he drew down the windowshade and lit the gasfixture beside the dressingtable then he took a cigar from his case and held it to the flame the passage from the stinging freshness of the night to the stale overheated atmosphere of the haslemere hotel had checked the preternaturally rapid working of his mind and he was now scarcely conscious of thinking at all his head was heavy and he would have thrown himself on the bed had he not feared to oversleep the hour fixed for his departure he thought it safest instead to seat himself once more by the table in the most uncomfortable chair that he could find and smoke one cigar after another till the first sign of dawn should give an excuse for action he had laid his watch on the table before him and was gazing at the hourhand and trying to convince himself by so doing that he was still wide awake when a noise in the adjoining room suddenly straightened him in his chair and banished all fear of sleep there was no mistaking the nature of the noise it was that of a womans sobs the sobs were not loud but the sound reached him distinctly through the frail door between the two rooms it expressed an utter abandonment to grief not the cloudburst of some passing emotion but the slow downpour of a whole heaven of sorrow woburn sat listening there was nothing else to be done and at least his listening was a mute tribute to the trouble he was powerless to relieve it roused too the drugged pulses of his own grief he was touched by the chance propinquity of two alien sorrows in a great city throbbing with multifarious passions it would have been more in keeping with the irony of life had he found himself next to a mother singing her child to sleep there seemed a mute commiseration in the hand that had led him to such neighborhood gradually the sobs subsided with pauses betokening an effort at selfcontrol at last they died off softly like the intermittent drops that end a day of rain poor soul woburn mused shes got the better of it for the time i wonder what its all about at the same moment he heard another sound that made him jump to his feet it was a very low sound but in that nocturnal silence which gives distinctness to the faintest noises woburn knew at once that he had heard the click of a pistol what is she up to now he asked himself with his eye on the door between the two rooms and the brightlylit keyhole seemed to reply with a glance of intelligence he turned out the gas and crept to the door pressing his eye to the illuminated circle after a moment or two of adjustment during which he seemed to himself to be breathing like a steamengine he discerned a room like his own with the same dressingtable flanked by gasfixtures and the same table in the window this table was directly in his line of vision and beside it stood a woman with a small revolver in her hands the lights being behind her woburn could only infer her youth from her slender silhouette and the nimbus of fair hair defining her head her dress seemed dark and simple and on a chair under one of the gasjets lay a jacket edged with cheap fur and a small travellingbag he could not see the other end of the room but something in her manner told him that she was alone at length she put the revolver down and took up a letter that lay on the table she drew the letter from its envelope and read it over two or three times then she put it back sealing the envelope and placing it conspicuously against the mirror of the dressingtable there was so grave a significance in this dumbshow that woburn felt sure that her next act would be to return to the table and take up the revolver but he had not reckoned on the vanity of woman after putting the letter in place she still lingered at the mirror standing a little sideways so that he could now see her face which was distinctly pretty but of a small and unelastic mould inadequate to the expression of the larger emotions for some moments she continued to study herself with the expression of a child looking at a playmate who has been scolded then she turned to the table and lifted the revolver to her forehead a sudden crash made her arm drop and sent her darting backward to the opposite side of the room woburn had broken down the door and stood torn and breathless in the breach oh she gasped pressing closer to the wall dont be frightened he said i saw what you were going to do and i had to stop you she looked at him for a moment in silence and he saw the terrified flutter of her breast then she said no one can stop me for long and besides what right have you every one has the right to prevent a crime he returned the sound of the last word sending the blood to his forehead i deny it she said passionately every one who has tried to live and failed has the right to die failed in what in everything she replied they stood looking at each other in silence at length he advanced a few steps youve no right to say youve failed he said while you have breath to try again he drew the revolver from her hand try again try again i tell you ive tried seventy times seven what have you tried she looked at him with a certain dignity i dont know she said that youve any right to question me or to be in this room at all and suddenly she burst into tears the discrepancy between her words and action struck the chord which in a mans heart always responds to the touch of feminine unreason she dropped into the nearest chair hiding her face in her hands while woburn watched the course of her weeping at last she lifted her head looking up between drenched lashes please go away she said in childish entreaty how can i he returned its impossible that i should leave you in this state trust me let me help you tell me what has gone wrong and lets see if theres no other way out of it woburn had a voice full of sensitive inflections and it was now trembling with profoundest pity its note seemed to reassure the girl for she said with a beginning of confidence in her own tones but i dont even know who you are woburn was silent the words startled him he moved nearer to her and went on in the same quieting tone i am a man who has suffered enough to want to help others i dont want to know any more about you than will enable me to do what i can for you ive probably seen more of life than you have and if youre willing to tell me your troubles perhaps together we may find a way out of them she dried her eyes and glanced at the revolver thats the only way out she said how do you know are you sure youve tried every other perfectly sure ive written and written and humbled myself like a slave before him and she wont even let him answer my letters oh but you dont understand she broke off with a renewal of weeping i begin to understand youre sorry for something youve done oh ive never denied that ive never denied that i was wicked and you want the forgiveness of some one you care about my husband she whispered youve done something to displease your husband to displease him i ran away with another man there was a dismal exultation in her tone as though she were paying woburn off for having underrated her offense she had certainly surprised him at worst he had expected a quarrel over a rival with a possible complication of motherinlaw he wondered how such helpless little feet could have taken so bold a step then he remembered that there is no audacity like that of weakness he was wondering how to lead her to completer avowal when she added forlornly you see theres nothing else to do woburn took a turn in the room it was certainly a narrower strait than he had foreseen and he hardly knew how to answer but the first flow of confession had eased her and she went on without farther persuasion i dont know how i could ever have done it i must have been downright crazy i didnt care much for joe when i married him he wasnt exactly handsome and girls think such a lot of that but he just laid down and worshipped me and i was getting fond of him in a way only the life was so dull id been used to a big city i come from detroit and hinksville is such a poky little place thats where we lived joe is telegraphoperator on the railroad there hed have been in a much bigger place now if he hadnt well after all he behaved perfectly splendidly about that i really was getting fond of him and i believe i should have realized in time how good and noble and unselfish he was if his mother hadnt been always sitting there and everlastingly telling me so we learned in school about the athenians hating some man who was always called just and thats the way i felt about joe whenever i did anything that wasnt quite right his mother would say how differently joe would have done it and she was forever telling me that joe didnt approve of this and that and the other when we were alone he approved of everything but when his mother was round hed sit quiet and let her say he didnt i knew hed let me have my way afterwards but somehow that didnt prevent my getting mad at the time and then the evenings were so long with joe away and mrs glenn thats his mother sitting there like an image knitting socks for the heathen the only caller we ever had was the baptist minister and he never took any more notice of me than if id been a piece of furniture i believe he was afraid to before mrs glenn she paused breathlessly and the tears in her eyes were now of anger well said woburn gently well then arthur hackett came along he was travelling for a big publishing firm in philadelphia he was awfully handsome and as clever and sarcastic as anything he used to lend me lots of novels and magazines and tell me all about society life in new york all the girls were after him and alice sprague whose father is the richest man in hinksville fell desperately in love with him and carried on like a fool but he wouldnt take any notice of her he never looked at anybody but me her face lit up with a reminiscent smile and then clouded again i hate him now she exclaimed with a change of tone that startled woburn id like to kill him but hes killed me instead well he bewitched me so i didnt know what i was doing i was like somebody in a trance when he wasnt there i didnt want to speak to anybody i used to lie in bed half the day just to get away from folks i hated joe and hinksville and everything else when he came back the days went like a flash we were together nearly all the time i knew joes mother was spying on us but i didnt care and at last it seemed as if i couldnt let him go away again without me so one evening he stopped at the back gate in a buggy and we drove off together and caught the eastern express at river bend he promised to bring me to new york she paused and then added scornfully he didnt even do that woburn had returned to his seat and was watching her attentively it was curious to note how her passion was spending itself in words he saw that she would never kill herself while she had any one to talk to that was five months ago she continued and we travelled all through the southern states and stayed a little while near philadelphia where his business is he did things real stylishly at first then he was sent to albany and we stayed a week at the delavan house one afternoon i went out to do some shopping and when i came back he was gone he had taken his trunk with him and hadnt left any address but in my travellingbag i found a fiftydollar bill with a slip of paper on which he had written no use coming after me im married wed been together less than four months and i never saw him again at first i couldnt believe it i stayed on thinking it was a joke or that hed feel sorry for me and come back but he never came and never wrote me a line then i began to hate him and to see what a wicked fool id been to leave joe i was so lonesome i thought id go crazy and i kept thinking how good and patient joe had been and how badly id used him and how lovely it would be to be back in the little parlor at hinksville even with mrs glenn and the minister talking about freewill and predestination so at last i wrote to joe i wrote him the humblest letters you ever read one after another but i never got any answer finally i found id spent all my money so i sold my watch and my rings joe gave me a lovely turquoise ring when we were married and came to new york i felt ashamed to stay alone any longer in albany i was afraid that some of arthurs friends who had met me with him on the road might come there and recognize me after i got here i wrote to susy price a great friend of mine who lives at hinksville and she answered at once and told me just what i had expected that joe was ready to forgive me and crazy to have me back but that his mother wouldnt let him stir a step or write me a line and that she and the minister were at him all day long telling him how bad i was and what a sin it would be to forgive me i got susys letter two or three days ago and after that i saw it was no use writing to joe hell never dare go against his mother and she watches him like a cat i suppose i deserve it but he might have given me another chance i know he would if he could only see me her voice had dropped from anger to lamentation and her tears again overflowed woburn looked at her with the pity one feels for a child who is suddenly confronted with the result of some unpremeditated naughtiness but why not go back to hinksville he suggested if your husband is ready to forgive you you could go to your friends house and once your husband knows you are there you can easily persuade him to see you perhaps i could susy thinks i could but i cant go back i havent got a cent left but surely you can borrow money cant you ask your friend to forward you the amount of your fare she shook her head susy aint well off she couldnt raise five dollars and it costs twentyfive to get back to hinksville and besides what would become of me while i waited for the money theyll turn me out of here tomorrow i havent paid my last weeks board and i havent got anything to give them my bags empty ive pawned everything and dont you know any one here who would lend you the money no not a soul at least i do know one gentleman hes a friend of arthurs a mr devine he was staying at rochester when we were there i met him in the street the other day and i didnt mean to speak to him but he came up to me and said he knew all about arthur and how meanly he had behaved and he wanted to know if he couldnt help me i suppose he saw i was in trouble he tried to persuade me to go and stay with his aunt who has a lovely house right round here in twentyfourth street he must be very rich for he offered to lend me as much money as i wanted you didnt take it no she returned i daresay he meant to be kind but i didnt care to be beholden to any friend of arthurs he came here again yesterday but i wouldnt see him so he left a note giving me his aunts address and saying shed have a room ready for me at any time there was a long silence she had dried her tears and sat looking at woburn with eyes full of helpless reliance well he said at length you did right not to take that mans money but this isnt the only alternative he added pointing to the revolver i dont know any other she answered wearily im not smart enough to get employment i cant make dresses or do typewriting or any of the useful things they teach girls now and besides even if i could get work i couldnt stand the loneliness i can never hold my head up again i cant bear the disgrace if i cant go back to joe id rather be dead and if you go back to joe it will be all right woburn suggested with a smile oh she cried her whole face alight if i could only go back to joe they were both silent again woburn sat with his hands in his pockets gazing at the floor at length his silence seemed to rouse her to the unwontedness of the situation and she rose from her seat saying in a more constrained tone i dont know why ive told you all this because you believed that i would help you woburn answered rising also and you were right im going to send you home she colored vividly you told me i was right not to take mr devines money she faltered yes he answered but did mr devine want to send you home he wanted me to wait at his aunts a little while first and then write to joe again i dont i want you to start tomorrow morning this morning i mean ill take you to the station and buy your ticket and your husband can send me back the money oh i cant i cant you mustnt she stammered reddening and paling besides theyll never let me leave here without paying how much do you owe fourteen dollars very well ill pay that for you you can leave me your revolver as a pledge but you must start by the first train have you any idea at what time it leaves the grand central i think theres one at eight he glanced at his watch in less than two hours then its after six now she stood before him with fascinated eyes you must have a very strong will she said when you talk like that you make me feel as if i had to do everything you say well you must said woburn lightly man was made to be obeyed oh youre not like other men she returned i never heard a voice like yours its so strong and kind you must be a very good man you remind me of joe im sure youve got just such a nature and joe is the best man ive ever seen woburn made no reply and she rambled on with little pauses and fresh bursts of confidence joes a real hero you know he did the most splendid thing you ever heard of i think i began to tell you about it but i didnt finish ill tell you now it happened just after we were married i was mad with him at the time im afraid but now i see how splendid he was hed been telegraph operator at hinksville for four years and was hoping that hed get promoted to a bigger place but he was afraid to ask for a raise well i was very sick with a bad attack of pneumonia and one night the doctor said he wasnt sure whether he could pull me through when they sent word to joe at the telegraph office he couldnt stand being away from me another minute there was a poor consumptive boy always hanging round the station joe had taught him how to operate just to help him along so he left him in the office and tore home for half an hour knowing he could get back before the eastern express came along he hadnt been gone five minutes when a freighttrain ran off the rails about a mile up the track it was a very still night and the boy heard the smash and shouting and knew something had happened he couldnt tell what it was but the minute he heard it he sent a message over the wires like a flash and caught the eastern express just as it was pulling out of the station above hinksville if hed hesitated a second or made any mistake the express would have come on and the loss of life would have been fearful the next day the hinksville papers were full of operator glenns presence of mind they all said hed be promoted that was early in november and joe didnt hear anything from the company till the first of january meanwhile the boy had gone home to his fathers farm out in the country and before christmas he was dead well on new years day joe got a notice from the company saying that his pay was to be raised and that he was to be promoted to a big junction near detroit in recognition of his presence of mind in stopping the eastern express it was just what wed both been pining for and i was nearly wild with joy but i noticed joe didnt say much he just telegraphed for leave and the next day he went right up to detroit and told the directors there what had really happened when he came back he told us theyd suspended him i cried every night for a week and even his mother said he was a fool after that we just lived on at hinksville and six months later the company took him back but i dont suppose theyll ever promote him now her voice again trembled with facile emotion wasnt it beautiful of him aint he a real hero she said and im sure youd behave just like him youd be just as gentle about little things and youd never move an inch about big ones youd never do a mean action but youd be sorry for people who did i can see it in your face thats why i trusted you right off woburns eyes were fixed on the window he hardly seemed to hear her at length he walked across the room and pulled up the shade the electric lights were dissolving in the gray alembic of the dawn a milkcart rattled down the street and like a witch returning late from the sabbath a stray cat whisked into an area so rose the appointed day woburn turned back drawing from his pocket the roll of bills which he had thrust there with so different a purpose he counted them out and handed her fifteen dollars that will pay for your board including your breakfast this morning he said well breakfast together presently if you like and meanwhile suppose we sit down and watch the sunrise i havent seen it for years he pushed two chairs toward the window and they sat down side by side the light came gradually with the icy reluctance of winter at last a red disk pushed itself above the opposite housetops and a long cold gleam slanted across their window they did not talk much there was a silencing awe in the spectacle presently woburn rose and looked again at his watch i must go and cover up my dresscoat he said and you had better put on your hat and jacket we shall have to be starting in half an hour as he turned away she laid her hand on his arm you havent even told me your name she said no he answered but if you get safely back to joe you can call me providence but how am i to send you the money oh well ill write you a line in a day or two and give you my address i dont know myself what it will be im a wanderer on the face of the earth but you must have my name if you mean to write to me well what is your name ruby glenn and i think i almost think you might send the letter right to joes send it to the hinksville station very well you promise of course i promise he went back into his room thinking how appropriate it was that she should have an absurd name like ruby as he reentered the room where the gas sickened in the daylight it seemed to him that he was returning to some forgotten land he had passed with the last few hours into a wholly new phase of consciousness he put on his fur coat turning up the collar and crossing the lapels to hide his white tie then he put his cigarcase in his pocket turned out the gas and picking up his hat and stick walked back through the open doorway ruby glenn had obediently prepared herself for departure and was standing before the mirror patting her curls into place her eyes were still red but she had the happy look of a child that has outslept its grief on the floor he noticed the tattered fragments of the letter which a few hours earlier he had seen her place before the mirror shall we go down now he asked very well she assented then with a quick movement she stepped close to him and putting her hands on his shoulders lifted her face to his i believe youre the best man i ever knew she said the very best except joe she drew back blushing deeply and unlocked the door which led into the passageway woburn picked up her bag which she had forgotten and followed her out of the room they passed a frowzy chambermaid who stared at them with a yawn before the doors the row of boots still waited there was a faint new aroma of coffee mingling with the smell of vanished dinners and a fresh blast of heat had begun to tingle through the radiators in the unventilated coffeeroom they found a waiter who had the melancholy air of being the last survivor of an exterminated race and who reluctantly brought them some tea made with water which had not boiled and a supply of stale rolls and staler butter on this meagre diet they fared in silence woburn occasionally glancing at his watch at length he rose telling his companion to go and pay her bill while he called a hansom after all there was no use in economizing his remaining dollars in a few moments she joined him under the portico of the hotel the hansom stood waiting and he sprang in after her calling to the driver to take them to the fortysecond street station when they reached the station he found a seat for her and went to buy her ticket there were several people ahead of him at the window and when he had bought the ticket he found that it was time to put her in the train she rose in answer to his glance and together they walked down the long platform in the murky chill of the roofedin air he followed her into the railway carriage making sure that she had her bag and that the ticket was safe inside it then he held out his hand in its pearlcoloured evening glove he felt that the people in the other seats were staring at them goodbye he said goodbye she answered flushing gratefully ill never forget never and you will write wont you promise of course of course he said hastening from the carriage he retraced his way along the platform passed through the dismal waitingroom and stepped out into the early sunshine on the sidewalk outside the station he hesitated awhile then he strolled slowly down fortysecond street and skirting the melancholy flank of the reservoir walked across bryant park finally he sat down on one of the benches near the sixth avenue and lit a cigar the signs of life were multiplying around him he watched the cars roll by with their increasing freight of dingy toilers the shopgirls hurrying to their work the children trudging schoolward their small vague noses red with cold their satchels clasped in woollengloved hands there is nothing very imposing in the first stirring of a great citys activities it is a slow reluctant process like the waking of a heavy sleeper but to woburns mood the sight of that obscure renewal of humble duties was more moving than the spectacle of an army with banners he sat for a long time smoking the last cigar in his case and murmuring to himself a line from hamlet the saddest he thought in the play for every man hath business and desire suddenly an unpremeditated movement made him feel the pressure of ruby glenns revolver in his pocket it was like a devils touch on his arm and he sprang up hastily in his other pocket there were just four dollars and fifty cents but that didnt matter now he had no thought of flight for a few minutes he loitered vaguely about the park then the cold drove him on again and with the rapidity born of a sudden resolve he began to walk down the fifth avenue towards his lodgings he brushed past a maidservant who was washing the vestibule and ran up stairs to his room a fire was burning in the grate and his books and photographs greeted him cheerfully from the walls the tranquil air of the whole room seemed to take it for granted that he meant to have his bath and breakfast and go down town as usual he threw off his coat and pulled the revolver out of his pocket for some moments he held it curiously in his hand bending over to examine it as ruby glenn had done then he laid it in the top drawer of a small cabinet and locking the drawer threw the key into the fire after that he went quietly about the usual business of his toilet in taking off his dresscoat he noticed the legion of honor which miss talcott had given him at the ball he pulled it out of his buttonhole and tossed it into the fireplace when he had finished dressing he saw with surprise that it was nearly ten oclock ruby glenn was already two hours nearer home woburn stood looking about the room of which he had thought to take final leave the night before among the ashes beneath the grate he caught sight of a little white heap which symbolized to his fancy the remains of his brief correspondence with miss talcott he roused himself from this unseasonable musing and with a final glance at the familiar setting of his past turned to face the future which the last hours had prepared for him he went down stairs and stepped out of doors hastening down the street towards broadway as though he were late for an appointment every now and then he encountered an acquaintance whom he greeted with a nod and smile he carried his head high and shunned no mans recognition at length he reached the doors of a tall granite building honeycombed with windows he mounted the steps of the portico and passing through the double doors of plateglass crossed a vestibule floored with mosaic to another glass door on which was emblazoned the name of the firm this door he also opened entering a large room with wainscotted subdivisions behind which appeared the stooping shoulders of a row of clerks as woburn crossed the threshold a grayhaired man emerged from an inner office at the opposite end of the room at sight of woburn he stopped short mr woburn he exclaimed then he stepped nearer and added in a low tone i was requested to tell you when you came that the members of the firm are waiting will you step into the private office the portrait it was at mrs mellishs one sunday afternoon last spring we were talking over george lillos portraits a collection of them was being shown at durandruels and a pretty woman had emphatically declared nothing on earth would induce me to sit to him there was a chorus of interrogations oh because he makes people look so horrid the way one looks on board ship or early in the morning or when ones hair is out of curl and one knows it id so much rather be done by mr cumberton little cumberton the fashionable purveyor of rosewater pastels stroked his moustache to hide a conscious smile lillo is a genius that we must all admit he said indulgently as though condoning a friends weakness but he has an unfortunate temperament he has been denied the gift so precious to an artist of perceiving the ideal he sees only the defects of his sitters one might almost fancy that he takes a morbid pleasure in exaggerating their weak points in painting them on their worst days but i honestly believe he cant help himself his peculiar limitations prevent his seeing anything but the most prosaic side of human nature a primrose by the rivers brim a yellow primrose is to him and it is nothing more cumberton looked round to surprise an order in the eye of the lady whose sentiments he had so deftly interpreted but poetry always made her uncomfortable and her nomadic attention had strayed to other topics his glance was tripped up by mrs mellish limitations but my dear man its because he hasnt any limitations because he doesnt wear the portraitpainters conventional blinders that were all so afraid of being painted by him its not because he sees only one aspect of his sitters its because he selects the real the typical one as instinctively as a detective collars a pickpocket in a crowd if theres nothing to paint no real person he paints nothing look at the sumptuous emptiness of his portrait of mrs guy awdrey why the pretty woman perplexedly interjected thats the only nice picture he ever did if theres one positive trait in a negative whole he brings it out in spite of himself if it isnt a nice trait so much the worse for the sitter it isnt lillos fault hes no more to blame than a mirror your other painters do the surface he does the depths they paint the ripples on the pond he drags the bottom he makes flesh seem as fortuitous as clothes when i look at his portraits of fine ladies in pearls and velvet i seem to see a little naked cowering wisp of a soul sitting beside the big splendid body like a poor relation in the darkest corner of an operabox but look at his pictures of really great people how great they are theres plenty of ideal there take his professor clyde how clearly the mans history is written in those broad steady strokes of the brush the hard work the endless patience the fearless imagination of the great savant or the picture of mr domfrey the man who has felt beauty without having the power to create it the very brushwork expresses the difference between the two the crowding of nervous tentative lines the subtler gradations of color somehow convey a suggestion of dilettantism you feel what a delicate instrument the man is how every sense has been tuned to the finest responsiveness mrs mellish paused blushing a little at the echo of her own eloquence my advice is dont let george lillo paint you if you dont want to be found out or to find yourself out thats why ive never let him do me im waiting for the day of judgment she ended with a laugh every one but the pretty woman whose eyes betrayed a quivering impatience to discuss clothes had listened attentively to mrs mellish lillos presence in new york he had come over from paris for the first time in twelve years to arrange the exhibition of his pictures gave to the analysis of his methods as personal a flavor as though one had been furtively dissecting his domestic relations the analogy indeed is not unapt for in lillos curiously detached existence it is difficult to figure any closer tie than that which unites him to his pictures in this light mrs mellishs flushed harangue seemed not unfitted to the trivialities of the tea hour and some one almost at once carried on the argument by saying but according to your theory that the significance of his work depends on the significance of the sitter his portrait of vard ought to be a masterpiece and its his biggest failure alonzo vards suicide he killed himself strangely enough the day that lillos pictures were first shown had made his portrait the chief feature of the exhibition it had been painted ten or twelve years earlier when the terrible boss was at the height of his power and if ever man presented a type to stimulate such insight as lillos that man was vard yet the portrait was a failure it was magnificently composed the technique was dazzling but the face had been well expurgated it was vard as cumberton might have painted him a common man trying to look at ease in a good coat the picture had never before been exhibited and there was a general outcry of disappointment it wasnt only the critics and the artists who grumbled even the big public which had gaped and shuddered at vard revelling in his genial villany and enjoying in his death that succumbing to divine wrath which as a spectacle is next best to its successful defiance even the public felt itself defrauded what had the painter done with their hero where was the big sneering domineering face that figured so convincingly in political cartoons and patentmedicine advertisements on cigarboxes and electioneering posters they had admired the man for looking his part so boldly for showing the undisguised blackguard in every line of his coarse body and cruel face the pseudogentleman of lillos picture was a poor thing compared to the real vard it had been vaguely expected that the great bosss portrait would have the zest of an incriminating document the scandalous attraction of secret memoirs and instead it was as insipid as an obituary it was as though the artist had been in league with his sitter had pledged himself to oppose to the lust for postmortem revelations an impassable blank wall of negation the public was resentful the critics were aggrieved even mrs mellish had to lay down her arms yes the portrait of vard is a failure she admitted and ive never known why if hed been an obscure elusive type of villain one could understand lillos missing the mark for once but with that face from the pit she turned at the announcement of a name which our discussion had drowned and found herself shaking hands with lillo the pretty woman started and put her hands to her curls cumberton dropped a condescending eyelid he never classed himself by recognizing degrees in the profession and mrs mellish cheerfully aware that she had been overheard said as she made room for lillo i wish youd explain it lillo smoothed his beard and waited for a cup of tea then would there be any failures he said if one could explain them ah in some cases i can imagine its impossible to seize the type or to say why one has missed it some people are like daguerreotypes in certain lights one cant see them at all but surely vard was obvious enough what i want to know is what became of him what did you do with him how did you manage to shuffle him out of sight it was much easier than you think i simply missed an opportunity that a signpainter would have seen very likely in fighting shy of the obvious one may miss the significant and when i got back from paris the pretty woman was heard to wail i found all the women here were wearing the very models id brought home with me mrs mellish as became a vigilant hostess got up and shuffled her guests and the question of yards portrait was dropped i left the house with lillo and on the way down fifth avenue after one of his long silences he suddenly asked is that what is generally said of my picture of vard i dont mean in the newspapers but by the fellows who know i said it was he drew a deep breath well he said its good to know that when one tries to fail one can make such a complete success of it tries to fail well no thats not quite it either i didnt want to make a failure of vards picture but i did so deliberately with my eyes open all the same it was what one might call a lucid failure but why the why of it is rather complicated ill tell you some time he hesitated come and dine with me at the club by and by and ill tell you afterwards its a nice morsel for a psychologist at dinner he said little but i didnt mind that i had known him for years and had always found something soothing and companionable in his long abstentions from speech his silence was never unsocial it was bland as a natural hush one felt ones self included in it not left out he stroked his beard and gazed absently at me and when we had finished our coffee and liqueurs we strolled down to his studio at the studio which was less draped less posed less consciously artistic than those of the smaller men he handed me a cigar and fell to smoking before the fire when he began to talk it was of indifferent matters and i had dismissed the hope of hearing more of vards portrait when my eye lit on a photograph of the picture i walked across the room to look at it and lillo presently followed with a light it certainly is a complete disguise he muttered over my shoulder then he turned away and stooped to a big portfolio propped against the wall did you ever know miss vard he asked with his head in the portfolio and without waiting for my answer he handed me a crayon sketch of a girls profile i had never seen a crayon of lillos and i lost sight of the sitters personality in the interest aroused by this new aspect of the masters complex genius the few lines faint yet how decisive flowered out of the rough paper with the lightness of opening petals it was a mere hint of a picture but vivid as some word that wakens long reverberations in the memory i felt lillo at my shoulder again you knew her i suppose i had to stop and think why of course id known her a silent handsome girl showy yet ineffective whom i had seen without seeing the winter that society had capitulated to vard still looking at the crayon i tried to trace some connection between the miss vard i recalled and the grave young seraph of lillos sketch had the vards bewitched him by what masterstroke of suggestion had he been beguiled into drawing the terrible father as a barbers block the commonplace daughter as this memorable creature you dont remember much about her no i suppose not she was a quiet girl and nobody noticed her much even when he paused with a smile you were all asking vard to dine i winced yes it was true we had all asked vard to dine it was some comfort to think that fate had made him expiate our weakness lillo put the sketch on the mantelshelf and drew his armchair to the fire its cold tonight take another cigar old man and some whiskey there ought to be a bottle and some glasses in that cupboard behind you help yourself ii about vards portrait he began well ill tell you its a queer story and most people wouldnt see anything in it my enemies might say it was a roundabout way of explaining a failure but you know better than that mrs mellish was right between me and vard there could be no question of failure the man was made for me i felt that the first time i clapped eyes on him i could hardly keep from asking him to sit to me on the spot but somehow one couldnt ask favors of the fellow i sat still and prayed hed come to me though for i was looking for something big for the next salon it was twelve years ago the last time i was out ere and i was ravenous for an opportunity i had the feeling do you writerfellows have it too that there was something tremendous in me if it could only be got out and i felt vard was the moses to strike the rock there were vulgar reasons too that made me hunger for a victim id been grinding on obscurely for a good many years without gold or glory and the first thing of mine that had made a noise was my picture of pepita exhibited the year before thered been a lot of talk about that orders were beginning to come in and i wanted to follow it up with a rousing big thing at the next salon then the critics had been insinuating that i could do only spanish things i suppose i had overdone the castanet business its a nurserydisease we all go through and i wanted to show that i had plenty more shot in my locker dont you get up every morning meaning to prove youre equal to balzac or thackeray thats the way i felt then only give me a chance i wanted to shout out to them and i saw at once that vard was my chance i had come over from paris in the autumn to paint mrs clingsborough and i met vard and his daughter at one of the first dinners i went to after that i could think of nothing but that mans head what a type i raked up all the details of his scandalous history and there were enough to fill an encyclopaedia the papers were full of him just then he was mud from head to foot it was about the time of the big viaduct steal and irreproachable citizens were forming ineffectual leagues to put him down and all the time one kept meeting him at dinners that was the beauty of it once i remember seeing him next to the bishops wife ive got a little sketch of that duet somewhere well he was simply magnificent a born ruler what a splendid condottiere he would have made in gold armor with a griffin grinning on his casque you remember those drawings of leonardos where the knights face and the outline of his helmet combine in one monstrous saurian profile he always reminded me of that but how was i to get at him one day it occurred to me to try talking to miss vard she was a monosyllabic person who didnt seem to see an inch beyond the last remark one had made but suddenly i found myself blurting out i wonder if you know how extraordinarily paintable your father is and you should have seen the change that came over her her eyes lit up and she looked well as ive tried to make her look there he glanced up at the sketch yes she said wasnt her father splendid and didnt i think him one of the handsomest men id ever seen that rather staggered me i confess i couldnt think her capable of joking on such a subject yet it seemed impossible that she should be speaking seriously but she was i knew it by the way she looked at vard who was sitting opposite his wolfish profile thrown back the shaggy locks tossed off his narrow high white forehead the girl worshipped him she went on to say how glad she was that i saw him as she did so many artists admired only regular beauty the stupid greek type that was made to be done in marble but shed always fancied from what shed seen of my work she knew everything id done it appeared that i looked deeper cared more for the way in which faces are modelled by temperament and circumstance and of course in that sense she concluded my fathers face is beautiful this was even more staggering but one couldnt question her divine sincerity im afraid my one thought was to take advantage of it and i let her go on perceiving that if i wanted to paint vard all i had to do was to listen she poured out her heart it was a glorious thing for a girl she said wasnt it to be associated with such a life as that she felt it so strongly sometimes that it oppressed her made her shy and stupid she was so afraid people would expect her to live up to him but that was absurd of course brilliant men so seldom had clever children still did i know she would have been happier much happier if he hadnt been in public life if he and she could have hidden themselves away somewhere with their books and music and she could have had it all to herself his cleverness his learning his immense unbounded goodness for no one knew how good he was no one but herself everybody recognized his cleverness his brilliant abilities even his enemies had to admit his extraordinary intellectual gifts and hated him the worse of course for the admission but no one no one could guess what he was at home she had heard of great men who were always giving gala performances in public but whose wives and daughters saw only the empty theatre with the footlights out and the scenery stacked in the wings but with him it was just the other way wonderful as he was in public in society she sometimes felt he wasnt doing himself justice he was so much more wonderful at home it was like carrying a guilty secret about with her his friends his admirers would never forgive her if they found out that he kept all his best things for her i dont quite know what i felt in listening to her i was chiefly taken up with leading her on to the point i had in view but even through my personal preoccupation i remember being struck by the fact that though she talked foolishly she didnt talk like a fool she was not stupid she was not obtuse one felt that her impassive surface was alive with delicate points of perception and this fact coupled with her crystalline frankness flung me back on a startled revision of my impressions of her father he came out of the test more monstrous than ever as an ugly image reflected in clear water is made uglier by the purity of the medium even then i felt a pang at the use to which fate had put the mountainpool of miss vards spirit and an uneasy sense that my own reflection there was not one to linger over it was odd that i should have scrupled to deceive on one small point a girl already so hugely cheated perhaps it was the completeness of her delusion that gave it the sanctity of a religious belief at any rate a distinct sense of discomfort tempered the satisfaction with which a day or two later i heard from her that her father had consented to give me a few sittings im afraid my scruples vanished when i got him before my easel he was immense and he was unexplored from my point of view hed never been done before i was his cortez as he talked the wonder grew his daughter came with him and i began to think she was right in saying that he kept his best for her it wasnt that she drew him out or guided the conversation but one had a sense of delicate vigilance hardly more perceptible than one of those atmospheric influences that give the pulses a happier turn she was a vivifying climate i had meant to turn the talk to public affairs but it slipped toward books and art and i was faintly aware of its being kept there without undue pressure before long i saw the value of the diversion it was easy enough to get at the political vard the other aspect was rarer and more instructive his daughter had described him as a scholar he wasnt that of course in any intrinsic sense like most men of his type he had gulped his knowledge standing as he had snatched his food from lunchcounters the wonder of it lay in his extraordinary power of assimilation it was the strangest instance of a mind to which erudition had given force and fluency without culture his learning had not educated his perceptions it was an implement serving to slash others rather than to polish himself i have said that at first sight he was immense but as i studied him he began to lessen under my scrutiny his depth was a false perspective painted on a wall it was there that my difficulty lay i had prepared too big a canvas for him intellectually his scope was considerable but it was like the digital reach of a mediocre pianist it didnt make him a great musician and morally he wasnt bad enough his corruption wasnt sufficiently imaginative to be interesting it was not so much a means to an end as a kind of virtuosity practised for its own sake like a highlydeveloped skill in cannoning billiard balls after all the point of view is what gives distinction to either vice or virtue a morality with groundglass windows is no duller than a narrow cynicism his daughters presence she always came with him gave unintentional emphasis to these conclusions for where she was richest he was naked she had a deeprooted delicacy that drew color and perfume from the very centre of her being his sentiments good or bad were as detachable as his cuffs thus her nearness planned as i guessed with the tender intention of displaying elucidating him of making him accessible in detail to my dazzled perceptions this pious design in fact defeated itself she made him appear at his best but she cheapened that best by her proximity for the man was vulgar to the core vulgar in spite of his force and magnitude thin hollow spectacular a lathandplaster bogey did she suspect it i think not then he was wrapped in her impervious faith the papers oh their charges were set down to political rivalry and the only people she saw were his hangerson or the fashionable set who had taken him up for their amusement besides she would never have found out in that way at a direct accusation her resentment would have flamed up and smothered her judgment if the truth came to her it would come through knowing intimately some one different through how shall i put it an imperceptible shifting of her centre of gravity my besetting fear was that i couldnt count on her obtuseness she wasnt what is called clever she left that to him but she was exquisitely good and now and then she had intuitive felicities that frightened me do i make you see her we fellows can explain better with the brush i dont know how to mix my words or lay them on she wasnt clever but her heart thought thats all i can say if shed been stupid it would have been easy enough i could have painted him as he was could have i did brushed the face in one day from memory it was the very man i painted it out before she came i couldnt bear to have her see it i had the feeling that i held her faith in him in my hands carrying it like a brittle object through a jostling mob a hairsbreadth swerve and it was in splinters when she wasnt there i tried to reason myself out of these subtleties my business was to paint vard as he was if his daughter didnt mind his looks why should i the opportunity was magnificent i knew that by the way his face had leapt out of the canvas at my first touch it would have been a big thing before every sitting i swore to myself id do it then she came and sat near him and i didnt i knew that before long shed notice i was shirking the face vard himself took little interest in the portrait but she watched me closely and one day when the sitting was over she stayed behind and asked me when i meant to begin what she called the likeness i guessed from her tone that the embarrassment was all on my side or that if she felt any it was at having to touch a vulnerable point in my pride thus far the only doubt that troubled her was a distrust of my ability well i put her off with any rot you please told her she must trust me must let me wait for the inspiration that some day the face would come i should see it suddenly feel it under my brush the poor child believed me you can make a woman believe almost anything she doesnt quite understand she was abashed at her philistinism and begged me not to tell her father he would make such fun of her after that well the sittings went on not many of course vard was too busy to give me much time still i could have done him ten times over never had i found my formula with such ease such assurance there were no hesitations no obstructions the face was there waiting for me at times it almost shaped itself on the canvas unfortunately miss vard was there too all this time the papers were busy with the viaduct scandal the outcry was getting louder you remember the circumstances one of vards associates bardwell wasnt it threatened disclosures the rival machine got hold of him the independents took him to their bosom and the press shrieked for an investigation it was not the first storm vard had weathered and his face wore just the right shade of cool vigilance he wasnt the man to fall into the mistake of appearing too easy his demeanor would have been superb if it had been inspired by a sense of his own strength but it struck me rather as based on contempt for his antagonists success is an inverted telescope through which ones enemies are apt to look too small and too remote as for miss vard her serenity was undiminished but i halfdetected a defiance in her unruffled sweetness and during the last sittings i had the factitious vivacity of a hostess who hears her best china crashing one day it did crash the headlines of the morning papers shouted the catastrophe at me the monster forced to disgorge warrant out against vard bardwell the bosss boomerang you know the kind of thing when i had read the papers i threw them down and went out as it happened vard was to have given me a sitting that morning but there would have been a certain irony in waiting for him i wished i had finished the picture i wished id never thought of painting it i wanted to shake off the whole business to put it out of my mind if i could i had the feeling i dont know if i can describe it that there was a kind of disloyalty to the poor girl in my even acknowledging to myself that i knew what all the papers were howling from the housetops i had walked for an hour when it suddenly occurred to me that miss vard might after all come to the studio at the appointed hour why should she i could conceive of no reason but the mere thought of what if she did come my absence would imply to her sent me bolting back to twelfth street it was a presentiment if you like for she was there as she rose to meet me a newspaper slipped from her hand id been fool enough when i went out to leave the damned things lying all over the place i muttered some apology for being late and she said reassuringly but my fathers not here yet your father i could have kicked myself for the way i bungled it he went out very early this morning and left word that he would meet me here at the usual hour she faced me with an eye full of bright courage across the newspaper lying between us he ought to be here in a moment now hes always so punctual but my watch is a little fast i think she held it out to me almost gaily and i was just pretending to compare it with mine when there was a smart rap on the door and vard stalked in there was always a civic majesty in his gait an air of having just stepped off his pedestal and of dissembling an oration in his umbrella and that day he surpassed himself miss vard had turned pale at the knock but the mere sight of him replenished her veins and if she now avoided my eye it was in mere pity for my discomfiture i was in fact the only one of the three who didnt instantly play up but such virtuosity was inspiring and by the time vard had thrown off his coat and dropped into a senatorial pose i was ready to pitch into my work i swore id do his face then and there do it as she saw it she sat close to him and i had only to glance at her while i painted vard himself was masterly his talk rattled through my hesitations and embarrassments like a brisk northwester sweeping the dry leaves from its path even his daughter showed the sudden brilliance of a lamp from which the shade has been removed we were all surprisingly vivid it felt somehow as though we were being photographed by flashlight it was the best sitting wed ever had but unfortunately it didnt last more than ten minutes it was vards secretary who interrupted us a slinking chap called cornley who burst in as white as sweetbread with the face of a depositor who hears his bank has stopped payment miss vard started up as he entered but caught herself together and dropped back into her chair vard who had taken out a cigarette held the tip tranquilly to his fus—Äe youre here thank god cornley cried theres no time to be lost mr vard ive got a carriage waiting round the corner in thirteenth street vard looked at the tip of his cigarette a carriage in thirteenth street my good fellow my own brougham is at the door i know i know but theyre there too sir or they will be inside of a minute for gods sake mr vard dont trifle theres a way out by thirteenth street i tell you bardwells myrmidons eh said vard help me on with my overcoat cornley will you cornleys teeth chattered mr vard your best friends miss vard wont you speak to your father he turned to me haggardly we can get out by the back way i nodded vard stood towering in some infernal way he seemed literally to rise to the situation one hand in the bosom of his coat in the attitude of patriotism in bronze i glanced at his daughter she hung on him with a drowning look suddenly she straightened herself there was something of vard in the way she faced her fears a kind of primitive calm we drawingroom folk dont have she stepped to him and laid her hand on his arm the pause hadnt lasted ten seconds father she said vard threw back his head and swept the studio with a sovereign eye the back way mr vard the back way cornley whimpered for gods sake sir dont lose a minute vard transfixed his abject henchman i have never yet taken the back way he enunciated and with a gesture matching the words he turned to me and bowed i regret the disturbance and he walked to the door his daughter was at his side alert transfigured stay here my dear never they measured each other an instant then he drew her arm in his she flung back one look at me a paean of victory and they passed out with cornley at their heels i wish id finished the face then i believe i could have caught something of the look she had tried to make me see in him unluckily i was too excited to work that day or the next and within the week the whole business came out if the indictment wasnt a putup job and on that i believe there were two opinions all that followed was you remember the farcical trial the packed jury the compliant judge the triumphant acquittal its a spectacle that always carries conviction to the voter vard was never more popular than after his exoneration i didnt see miss vard for weeks it was she who came to me at length came to the studio alone one afternoon at dusk she had what shall i say a veiled manner as though she had dropped a fine gauze between us i waited for her to speak she glanced about the room admiring a hawthorn vase i had picked up at auction then after a pause she said you havent finished the picture not quite i said she asked to see it and i wheeled out the easel and threw the drapery back oh she murmured you havent gone on with the face i shook my head she looked down on her clasped hands and up at the picture not once at me you youre going to finish it of course i cried throwing the revived purpose into my voice by god i would finish it the merest tinge of relief stole over her face faint as the first thin chirp before daylight is it so very difficult she asked tentatively not insuperably i hope she sat silent her eyes on the picture at length with an effort she brought out shall you want more sittings for a second i blundered between two conflicting conjectures then the truth came to me with a leap and i cried out no no more sittings she looked up at me then for the first time looked too soon poor child for in the spreading light of reassurance that made her eyes like a rainy dawn i saw with terrible distinctness the rout of her disbanded hopes i knew that she knew i finished the picture and sent it home within a week i tried to make it what you see too late you say yes for her but not for me or for the public if she could be made to feel for a day longer for an hour even that her miserable secret was a secret why shed made it seem worth while to me to chuck my own ambitions for that lillo rose and taking down the sketch stood looking at it in silence after a while i ventured and miss vard he opened the portfolio and put the sketch back tying the strings with deliberation then turning to relight his cigar at the lamp he said she died last year thank god
