ezra m kuhns foreword happy hollow are you wondering where it is wherever negroes colonise in the cities or villages north or south wherever the hod carrier the porter and the waiter are the society men of the town wherever the picnic and the excursion are the chief summer diversion and the revival the winter time of repentance wherever the cheese cloth veil obtains at a wedding and the little white hearse goes by with black mourners in the one carriage behind there there is happy hollow wherever laughter and tears rub elbows day by day and the spirit of labour and laziness shake hands there there is happy hollow and of some of it may the following pages show the heart the author one the scapegoat i the law is usually supposed to be a stern mistress not to be lightly wooed and yielding only to the most ardent pursuit but even law like love sits more easily on some natures than on others this was the case with mr robinson asbury mr asbury had started life as a bootblack in the growing town of cadgers from this he had risen one step and become porter and messenger in a barbershop this rise fired his ambition and he was not content until he had learned to use the shears and the razor and had a chair of his own from this in a man of robinsons temperament it was only a step to a shop of his own and he placed it where it would do the most good fully onehalf of the population of cadgers was composed of negroes and with their usual tendency to colonise a tendency encouraged and in fact compelled by circumstances they had gathered into one part of the town here in alleys and streets as dirty and hardly wider they thronged like ants it was in this place that mr asbury set up his shop and he won the hearts of his prospective customers by putting up the significant sign equal rights barbershop this legend was quite unnecessary because there was only one race about to patronise the place but it was a delicate sop to the peoples vanity and it served its purpose asbury came to be known as a clever fellow and his business grew the shop really became a sort of club and on saturday nights especially was the gatheringplace of the men of the whole negro quarter he kept the illustrated and race journals there and those who cared neither to talk nor listen to someone else might see pictured the doings of high society in very short skirts or read in the negro papers how miss boston had entertained miss blueford to tea on such and such an afternoon also he kept the policy returns which was wise if not moral it was his wisdom rather more than his morality that made the party managers after a while cast their glances toward him as a man who might be useful to their interests it would be well to have a man a shrewd powerful man down in that part of the town who could carry his peoples vote in his vest pocket and who at any time its delivery might be needed could hand it over without hesitation asbury seemed that man and they settled upon him they gave him money and they gave him power and patronage he took it all silently and he carried out his bargain faithfully his hands and his lips alike closed tightly when there was anything within them it was not long before he found himself the big negro of the district and of necessity of the town the time came when at a critical moment the managers saw that they had not reckoned without their host in choosing this barber of the black district as the leader of his people now so much success must have satisfied any other man but in many ways mr asbury was unique for a long time he himself had done very little shaving except of notes to keep his hand in his time had been otherwise employed in the evening hours he had been wooing the coquettish dame law and wonderful to say she had yielded easily to his advances it was against the advice of his friends that he asked for admission to the bar they felt that he could do more good in the place where he was you see robinson said old judge davis its just like this if youre not admitted itll hurt you with the people if you are admitted youll move uptown to an office and get out of touch with them asbury smiled an inscrutable smile then he whispered something into the judges ear that made the old man wrinkle from his neck up with appreciative smiles asbury he said you are you are well you ought to be white thats all when we find a black man like you we send him to states prison if you were white youd go to the senate the negro laughed confidently he was admitted to the bar soon after whether by merit or by connivance is not to be told now he will move uptown said the black community well thats the way with a coloured man when he gets a start but they did not know asbury robinson yet he was a man of surprises and they were destined to disappointment he did not move uptown he built an office in a small open space next his shop and there hung out his shingle i will never desert the people who have done so much to elevate me said mr asbury i will live among them and i will die among them this was a strong card for the barberlawyer the people seized upon the statement as expressing a nobility of an altogether unique brand they held a mass meeting and indorsed him they made resolutions that extolled him and the negro band came around and serenaded him playing various things in varied time all this was very sweet to mr asbury and the party managers chuckled with satisfaction and said that asbury that asbury now there is a fable extant of a man who tried to please everybody and his failure is a matter of record robinson asbury was not more successful but be it said that his ill success was due to no fault or shortcoming of his for a long time his growing power had been looked upon with disfavour by the coloured law firm of bingo latchett both mr bingo and mr latchett themselves aspired to be negro leaders in cadgers and they were delivering emancipation day orations and riding at the head of processions when mr asbury was blacking boots is it any wonder then that they viewed with alarm his sudden rise they kept their counsel however and treated with him for it was best they allowed him his scope without open revolt until the day upon which he hung out his shingle this was the last straw they could stand no more asbury had stolen their other chances from them and now he was poaching upon the last of their preserves so mr bingo and mr latchett put their heads together to plan the downfall of their common enemy the plot was deep and embraced the formation of an opposing faction made up of the best negroes of the town it would have looked too much like what it was for the gentlemen to show themselves in the matter and so they took into their confidence mr isaac morton the principal of the coloured school and it was under his ostensible leadership that the new faction finally came into being mr morton was really an innocent young man and he had ideals which should never have been exposed to the air when the wily confederates came to him with their plan he believed that his worth had been recognised and at last he was to be what nature destined him for a leader the better class of negroes by that is meant those who were particularly envious of asburys success flocked to the new mans standard but whether the race be white or black political virtue is always in a minority so asbury could afford to smile at the force arrayed against him the new faction met together and resolved they resolved among other things that mr asbury was an enemy to his race and a menace to civilisation they decided that he should be abolished but as they couldnt get out an injunction against him and as he had the whole undignified but still voting black belt behind him he went serenely on his way theyre after you hot and heavy asbury said one of his friends to him oh yes was the reply theyre after me but after a while ill get so far away that theyll be running in front its all the best people they say yes well its good to be one of the best people but your vote only counts one just the same the time came however when mr asburys theory was put to the test the cadgerites celebrated the first of january as emancipation day on this day there was a large procession with speechmaking in the afternoon and fireworks at night it was the custom to concede the leadership of the coloured people of the town to the man who managed to lead the procession for two years past this honour had fallen of course to robinson asbury and there had been no disposition on the part of anybody to try conclusions with him mr mortons faction changed all this when asbury went to work to solicit contributions for the celebration he suddenly became aware that he had a fight upon his hands all the betterclass negroes were staying out of it the next thing he knew was that plans were on foot for a rival demonstration oh he said to himself thats it is it well if they want a fight they can have it he had a talk with the party managers and he had another with judge davis all i want is a little lift judge he said and ill make em think the sky has turned loose and is vomiting niggers the judge believed that he could do it so did the party managers asbury got his lift emancipation day came there were two parades at least there was one parade and the shadow of another asburys however was not the shadow there was a great deal of substance about it substance made up of many people many banners and numerous bands he did not have the best people indeed among his cohorts there were a good many of the pronounced ragtag and bobtail but he had noise and numbers in such cases nothing more is needed the success of asburys side of the affair did everything to confirm his friends in their good opinion of him when he found himself defeated mr silas bingo saw that it would be policy to placate his rivals just anger against him he called upon him at his office the day after the celebration well asbury he said you beat us didnt you it wasnt a question of beating said the other calmly it was only an inquiry as to who were the people the few or the many well it was well done and youve shown that you are a manager i confess that i havent always thought that you were doing the wisest thing in living down here and catering to this class of people when you might with your ability to be much more to the better class what do they base their claims of being better on oh there aint any use discussing that we cant get along without you we see that so i for one have decided to work with you for harmony harmony yes thats what we want if i can do anything to help you at any time why you have only to command me i am glad to find such a friend in you be sure if i ever need you bingo ill call on you and ill be ready to serve you asbury smiled when his visitor was gone he smiled and knitted his brow i wonder what bingos got up his sleeve he said hell bear watching it may have been pride at his triumph it may have been gratitude at his helpers but asbury went into the ensuing campaign with reckless enthusiasm he did the most daring things for the partys sake bingo true to his promise was ever at his side ready to serve him finally association and immunity made danger less fearsome the rival no longer appeared a menace with the generosity born of obstacles overcome asbury determined to forgive bingo and give him a chance he let him in on a deal and from that time they worked amicably together until the election came and passed it was a close election and many things had had to be done but there were men there ready and waiting to do them they were successful and then the first cry of the defeated party was as usual fraud fraud the cry was taken up by the jealous the disgruntled and the virtuous someone remembered how two years ago the registration books had been stolen it was known upon good authority that money had been freely used men held up their hands in horror at the suggestion that the negro vote had been juggled with as if that were a new thing from their pulpits ministers denounced the machine and bade their hearers rise and throw off the yoke of a corrupt municipal government one of those sudden fevers of reform had taken possession of the town and threatened to destroy the successful party they began to look around them they must purify themselves they must give the people some tangible evidence of their own yearnings after purity they looked around them for a sacrifice to lay upon the altar of municipal reform their eyes fell upon mr bingo no he was not big enough his blood was too scant to wash away the political stains then they looked into each others eyes and turned their gaze away to let it fall upon mr asbury they really hated to do it but there must be a scapegoat the god from the machine commanded them to slay him robinson asbury was charged with many crimes with all that he had committed and some that he had not when mr bingo saw what was afoot he threw himself heart and soul into the work of his old rivals enemies he was of incalculable use to them judge davis refused to have anything to do with the matter but in spite of his disapproval it went on asbury was indicted and tried the evidence was all against him and no one gave more damaging testimony than his friend mr bingo the judges charge was favourable to the defendant but the current of popular opinion could not be entirely stemmed the jury brought in a verdict of guilty before i am sentenced judge i have a statement to make to the court it will take less than ten minutes go on robinson said the judge kindly asbury started in a monotonous tone a recital that brought the prosecuting attorney to his feet in a minute the judge waved him down and sat transfixed by a sort of fascinated horror as the convicted man went on the beforementioned attorney drew a knife and started for the prisoners dock with difficulty he was restrained a dozen faces in the courtroom were red and pale by turns he ought to be killed whispered mr bingo audibly robinson asbury looked at him and smiled and then he told a few things of him he gave the ins and outs of some of the misdemeanours of which he stood accused he showed who were the men behind the throne and still pale and transfixed judge davis waited for his own sentence never were ten minutes so well taken up it was a tale of rottenness and corruption in high places told simply and with the stamp of truth upon it he did not mention the judges name but he had torn the mask from the face of every other man who had been concerned in his downfall they had shorn him of his strength but they had forgotten that he was yet able to bring the roof and pillars tumbling about their heads the judges voice shook as he pronounced sentence upon his old ally a year in states prison some people said it was too light but the judge knew what it was to wait for the sentence of doom and he was grateful and sympathetic when the sheriff led asbury away the judge hastened to have a short talk with him im sorry robinson he said and i want to tell you that you were no more guilty than the rest of us but why did you spare me because i knew you were my friend answered the convict i tried to be but you were the first man that ive ever known since ive been in politics who ever gave me any decent return for friendship i reckon youre about right judge in politics party reform usually lies in making a scapegoat of someone who is only as criminal as the rest but a little weaker asburys friends and enemies had succeeded in making him bear the burden of all the partys crimes but their reform was hardly a success and their protestations of a change of heart were received with doubt already there were those who began to pity the victim and to say that he had been hardly dealt with mr bingo was not of these but he found strange to say that his opposition to the idea went but a little way and that even with asbury out of his path he was a smaller man than he was before fate was strong against him his poor prosperous humanity could not enter the lists against a martyr robinson asbury was now a martyr ii a year is not a long time it was short enough to prevent people from forgetting robinson and yet long enough for their pity to grow strong as they remembered indeed he was not gone a year good behaviour cut two months off the time of his sentence and by the time people had come around to the notion that he was really the greatest and smartest man in cadgers he was at home again he came back with no flourish of trumpets but quietly humbly he went back again into the heart of the black district his business had deteriorated during his absence but he put new blood and new life into it he did not go to work in the shop himself but taking down the shingle that had swung idly before his office door during his imprisonment he opened the little room as a newsand cigarstand here anxious pitying custom came to him and he prospered again he was very quiet uptown hardly knew that he was again in cadgers and it knew nothing whatever of his doings i wonder why asbury is so quiet they said to one another it isnt like him to be quiet and they felt vaguely uneasy about him so many people had begun to say well he was a mighty good fellow after all mr bingo expressed the opinion that asbury was quiet because he was crushed but others expressed doubt as to this there are calms and calms some after and some before the storm which was this they waited a while and as no storm came concluded that this must be the afterquiet bingo reassured volunteered to go and seek confirmation of this conclusion he went and asbury received him with an indifferent not to say impolite demeanour well were glad to see you back asbury said bingo patronisingly he had variously demonstrated his inability to lead during his rivals absence and was proud of it what are you going to do im going to work thats right i reckon youll stay out of politics what could i do even if i went in nothing now of course but i didnt know he did not see the gleam in asburys half shut eyes he only marked his humility and he went back swelling with the news completely crushed all the run taken out of him was his report the black district believed this too and a sullen smouldering anger took possession of them here was a good man ruined some of the people whom he had helped in his former days some of the rude coarse people of the low quarter who were still sufficiently unenlightened to be grateful talked among themselves and offered to get up a demonstration for him but he denied them no he wanted nothing of the kind it would only bring him into unfavourable notice all he wanted was that they would always be his friends and would stick by him they would to the death there were again two factions in cadgers the schoolmaster could not forget how once on a time he had been made a tool of by mr bingo so he revolted against his rule and set himself up as the leader of an opposing clique the fight had been long and strong but had ended with odds slightly in bingos favour but mr morton did not despair as the first of january and emancipation day approached he arrayed his hosts and the fight for supremacy became fiercer than ever the schoolteacher is giving you a pretty hard brought the schoolchildren in for chorus singing secured an able orator and the best essayist in town with all this he was formidable mr bingo knew that he had the fight of his life on his hands and he entered with fear as well as zest he too found an orator but he was not sure that he was as good as mortons there was no doubt but that his essayist was not he secured a band but still he felt unsatisfied he had hardly done enough and for the schoolmaster to beat him now meant his political destruction it was in this state of mind that he was surprised to receive a visit from mr asbury i reckon youre surprised to see me here said asbury smiling i am pleased i know bingo was astute well i just dropped in on business to be sure to be sure asbury what can i do for you its more what i can do for you that i came to talk about was the reply i dont believe i understand you well its plain enough they say that the schoolteacher is giving you a pretty hard fight oh not so hard no man can be too sure of winning though mr morton once did me a mean turn when he started the faction against me bingos heart gave a great leap and then stopped for the fraction of a second you were in it of course pursued asbury but i can look over your part in it in order to get even with the man who started it it was true then thought bingo gladly he did not know he wanted revenge for his wrongs and upon the wrong man how well the schemer had covered his tracks asbury should have his revenge and morton would be the sufferer of course asbury you know what i did i did innocently oh yes in politics we are all lambs and the wolves are only to be found in the other party well pass that though what i want to say is that i can help you to make your celebration an overwhelming success i still have some influence down in my district certainly and very justly too why i should be delighted with your aid i could give you a prominent place in the procession i dont want it i dont want to appear in this at all all i want is revenge you can have all the credit but let me down my enemy bingo was perfectly willing and with their heads close together they had a long and close consultation when asbury was gone mr bingo lay back in his chair and laughed im a slick duck he said from that hour mr bingos cause began to take on the appearance of something very like a boom more bands were hired the interior of the state was called upon and a more eloquent orator secured the crowd hastened to array itself on the growing side with surprised eyes the schoolmaster beheld the wonder of it but he kept to his own purpose with dogged insistence even when he saw that he could not turn aside the overwhelming defeat that threatened him but in spite of his obstinacy his hours were dark and bitter asbury worked like a mole all underground but he was indefatigable two days before the celebration time everything was perfected for the biggest demonstration that cadgers had ever known all the next day and night he was busy among his allies on the morning of the great day mr bingo wonderfully caparisoned rode down to the hall where the parade was to form he was early no one had yet come in an hour a score of men all told had collected another hour passed and no more had come then there smote upon his ear the sound of music they were coming at last bringing his sword to his shoulder he rode forward to the middle of the street ah there they were but but could he believe his eyes they were going in another direction and at their head rode morton he gnashed his teeth in fury he had been led into a trap and betrayed the procession passing had been his all his he heard them cheering and then oh climax of infidelity he saw his own orator go past in a carriage bowing and smiling to the crowd there was no doubting who had done this thing the hand of asbury was apparent in it he must have known the truth all along thought bingo his allies left him one by one for the other hall and he rode home in a humiliation deeper than he had ever known before asbury did not appear at the celebration he was at his little newsstand all day in a day or two the defeated aspirant had further cause to curse his false friend he found that not only had the people defected from him but that the thing had been so adroitly managed that he appeared to be in fault and threefourths of those who knew him were angry at some supposed grievance his cup of bitterness was full when his partner a quietly ambitious man suggested that they dissolve their relations his ruin was complete the lawyer was not alone in seeing asburys hand in his downfall the party managers saw it too and they met together to discuss the dangerous factor which while it appeared to slumber was so terribly awake they decided that he must be appeased and they visited him he was still busy at his newsstand they talked to him adroitly while he sorted papers and kept an impassive face when they were all done he looked up for a moment and replied you know gentlemen as an exconvict i am not in politics some of them had the grace to flush but you can use your influence they said i am not in politics was his only reply and the spring elections were coming on well they worked hard and he showed no sign he treated with neither one party nor the other perhaps thought the managers he is out of politics and they grew more confident it was nearing eleven oclock on the morning of election when a cloud no bigger than a mans hand appeared upon the horizon it came from the direction of the black district it grew and the managers of the party in power looked at it fascinated by an ominous dread finally it began to rain negro voters and as one man they voted against their former candidates their organisation was perfect they simply came voted and left but they overwhelmed everything not one of the party that had damned robinson asbury was left in power save old judge davis his majority was overwhelming the generalship that had engineered the thing was perfect there were loud threats against the newsdealer but no one bothered him except a reporter the reporter called to see just how it was done he found asbury very busy sorting papers to the newspaper mans questions he had only this reply i am not in politics sir but cadgers had learned its lesson two one christmas at shiloh martha maria mixon was a widder lady so she described herself whenever anyone asked her as to her status in life to her more intimate friends she confided that she was not a weed widder but one of the grass variety the story of how her husband madison had never been no count even befo de wah and of his rapid degeneration thereafter was vividly told de fact of de mattah is mrs mixon was wont to say my man madison was nevah no han to wok he was de settindownest man you evah seed hit wouldnt a been so bad but madison was a lakly man an his tongue wah smoothah dan ile so hit twant no shakes fu him to fool ol mas bout his

aftah him den i think he signed de nomernation this was marthas story and the reason that there was no mr mixon with her when she came north drifted from place to place and finally became one of new yorks large black contingent from the south to her the lessons of slavery had not been idle ones industrious careful and hardworking she soon became prosperous and when hunting a spiritual home she settled upon shiloh chapel she was welcomed there as a distinct addition to the large and active membership shiloh was not one of the fashionable churches of the city but it was primarily a church home for any southern negro for in it were representatives of every one of the old slaveholding states its pastor was one of those who had not yet got beyond the belief that any temporal preparation for the preaching of the gospel was unnecessary it was still his firm trust and often his boast that if one opened his mouth the lord would fill it and it grew to be a settled idea that the lord filled his acceptably for his converts were many and his congregation increased the rev silas todburys education may have been deficient in other matters but one thing he knew and knew thoroughly the disposition of his people he knew just what weaknesses longings and desires their recent bondage had left with them and with admirable shrewdness contrived to meet them he knew that in preaching they wanted noise emotion and fire that in the preacher they wanted freeheartedness and cordiality he knew that when christmas came they wanted a great rally somewhat approaching at least the rousing times both spiritual and temporal that they had had back on the old plantation when christmas meant a week of pleasurable excitement knowing the last so well it was with commendable foresight that he began early his preparations for a big time on a certain christmas not long ago i tell you people he said to his congregation wes goin to have a reglar benjamins mess the coloured folk being not quite sure of the quotation laughed heartily exclaiming in admiration of their pastor dat todbuy is sholy one mess hissef now any of de sistahs dats willin to hep mek dis comin chrismus a real sho nough one ll blige me by meetin me in de basement of de chuch aftah services de brothahs kin go long home twell dey called fu there was another outburst of merriment at this sally and it was a goodnatured score or more of sisters who a little later met the pastor as agreed among them was martha maria mixon for she was very close to her pastor and for many a day had joyed his clerical heart with special dinners ah said the preacher rubbing his hands sistah marthy i see yous on han ez usual to hep me out an you too sis jinny an sis dicey he added quick to note the signs of any incipient jealousy and equally ready to check it wes all hyeah de faithful few an wes all ready fu wok the sisters beamed and nodded well we goin to have somepn evah night beginnin wid chrismus night straight on endurin of de week an i want to separate you all into companies fu to take chawge of each night now is agoin to have a powahful preachah fom de souf wid us an i want you all to show him what we kin do on chrismus day we goin to have a sermont at de chuch an a festabal in de evenin wid a chrismus tree sis marthy i want you to boad de minister la brothah todbuy i dont scarcely feel lak is portant nough fu dat said mrs mixon modestly but ill do de bes i kin i hatter be lak de widders mice in de scuse o meal we aint got no doubt bout what you able to do sis marthy and the pastor passed to the appointment of his other committees after evening services the brothers were similarly called in consultation and appointed to their respective duties to the black people to whom these responsibilities were thus turned over joy came and with it the vision of other days the vision of the dear old days the hard old days back there in the south when they had looked forward to their christmas from year to year then it had been a time of sadness as well as of joy for they knew that though the week was full of pleasure after it was over must come separation and sadness for this was the time when those who were to be hired out loaned or given away were to change their homes so even while they danced they sighed and while they shouted they moaned now there was no such repressing fact to daunt them christmas would come they would enjoy themselves and after it was over would go back to the same homes to live through the round of months in the midst of familiar faces and among their own old loved ones the thought gave sweetness to their labour and the responsibilities devolving upon them imbued the sacred holiday with a meaning and charm that it had never had before for them they bubbled over with importance and with the glory of it a sister and a brother could not meet without a friendly banter hi sis dicey brother williams would call out across the fence to his neighbour i don believe you doin anything tods dat chrismus celebration evah time i sees you yous in de washtub tryin to mek braid an meat fo dat no count man o yon sister diceys laugh rang out loud and musical before she replied nevah you min brothah williams i don see yo back bowed so much by de yoke oh honey is laboin even ef you don know it but youll see it on de day i low you laboin de mos to git dat wife o yon a new dress and her tormentors guffaw seemed to admit some such benevolent intention in the corners of every house where the younger and more worldlyminded people congregated there was much whispering and giggling for they had their own plans for christmas outside of the church affair you goin to give me de pleasure of yo compny to de dance aftah de festabal some ardent and early swain would murmur to his lady love and the whisper would fly back in wellfeigned affright heish man you want to have brothah todbuy chuchin me but if the swain persisted there was little chance of his being ultimately refused so the world the flesh and the devil kept pace with the things of the spirit in the great preparation meanwhile martha maria mixon went her own way working hard fixing and observing she had determined to excel herself this time and not only should her part at the church be above reproach but the entertainment which she would give that strange preacher would be a thing long to be remembered and so almost startled at all that shiloh was preparing for his reception hoary christmas approached all new york was a dazzling bazar through which the people thronged ceaselessly tumultuously everyone was a child again holly wreaths with the red berries gleaming amid the green were everywhere and the white streets were gay with laughter and bustle and life on the night before the great day martha sat before her fire and hummed softly to herself there was a smile upon her face for she had worked and worked well and now all was ready and to her entire satisfaction something which shall be nameless simmered in a tin cup on the back of the stove before her and every now and then she broke her reverie to sip of it it smelled sweet and pungent and suspicious but then this was christmas eve she was half drowsing when a brisk knock startled her into wakefulness thinking it was one of the neighbours in for a call she bade the visitor enter without moving there was a stamping of feet and the door opened and a black man covered with snow stood before her he said nothing martha rubbed her eyes and stared at him and then she looked at the cup accusingly and from it back to the man then she rubbed her eyes again wha wha she stammered rising slowly don you know me marthy don you know me an don you want to see yo husban madison mixon is dat you in de flesh its me marthy you tol me ef evah i made a man o mysef to seek you its been a long road but is tried faithful all the memories of other days came rushing over martha in an overwhelming flood in one moment everything was forgotten save that here stood her long delinquent husband she threw out her arms and took a step toward him but he anticipated her further advance and rushing to her clasped her ample form in a close embrace you will tek me back he cried you will fugive me yes yes of cose i will madison ef you has made a man of yosef i hopes to prove dat to you it was a very pleasant evening that they spent together and like old times to martha never once did it occur to her that this sudden finding of a husband might be awkward on the morrow when the visitor came to dinner nor did she once suspect that madison might be up to one of his old tricks she accepted him for just what he said he was and intended to be her first doubt came the next morning when she began to hurry her preparations for church madison had been fumbling in his carpet bag and was already respectably dressed his wife looked at him approvingly but the glance turned to one of consternation when he stammered forth that he had to go out as he had some business to attend to what on de vey fust day you hyeah aint you goin to chuch wid me de busness is mighty pressin but i hopes to see you at chuch by de time de services begin waih does you set his hand was on the door martha sank into a chair and the tears came to her eyes but she choked them back she would not let him see how much she was hurt she told him in a faltering voice where she sat and he passed out then her tears came and flooded away the last hope she had been so proud to think that she would walk to church with her husband that morning for the first time in so long a while and now it was all over for a little while she thought that she would not go and then the memory of all the preparations she had made and of the new minister came to her and she went on with her dressing the church was crowded that morning when martha arrived she looked around in vain for some sight of madison but she could see nothing of him and so she sank into her seat with a sigh she could just see the new minister drooping in his seat behind the reading desk he was evidently deep in meditation for he did not get up during the hymn then martha heard the rev silas todbury speaking his words did not affect her until she found that the whole of his closing sentence was flashing through her brain like a flame we will now be exhoted by de reverent madison mixon she couldnt believe her ears but stared wildly at the pulpit where the new preacher stood it was madison her first impulse was to rise in her seat and stop him it was another of his tricks and he should not profane the church but his look and voice silenced her and she sank back in amazement he preached a powerful sermon and at its close told something of his life and who he was and martha found herself all at once the centre of attention and her face glowed and her heart burned within her as the people about her nodded and smiled at her through their tears and hurled amen upon amen madison hurried to her side after the services i des wanted to sprise you a little marthy he said she was too happy to answer and pressing his arm very tightly she walked out among her congratulating friends and between her husband and the rev silas todbury went proudly home to her christmas dinner three the mission of mr scatters it took something just short of a revolution to wake up the sleepy little town of miltonville through the slow hot days it drowsed along like a lazy dog only half rousing now and then to snap at some flying rumour and relapsing at once into its pristine somnolence it was not a dreamless sleep however that held the town in chains it had its dreams dreams of greatness of wealth of consequence and of growth granted that there was no effort to realise these visions they were yet there and combined with the memory of a past that was not without credit went far to give tone to its dormant spirit it was a real spirit too the gallant bourbon spirit of the old south of kentucky when she is most the daughter of virginia as was evidenced in the awed respect which all miltonvillians white and black alike showed to major richardson in his house on the hill he was part of the traditions of the place it was shown in the conservatism of the old white families and a certain stalwart if reflected selfrespect in the older coloured inhabitants in all the days since the school had been founded and mr dunkins marriage to the teacher had raised a brief ripple of excitement these coloured people had slumbered they were still slumbering that hot august day unmindful of the sensation that lay at their very doors heedless of the portents that said as plain as preaching miltonville the time is at hand awake so it was that that afternoon there were only a few loungers and these not very alert about the station when the little train wheezed and puffed its way into it it had been so long since anyone save those whom they knew had alighted at miltonville that the loungers had lost faith and with it curiosity and now they scarcely changed their positions as the little engine stopped with a snort of disgust but in an instant indifference had fled as the mist before the sun and every eye on the platform was staring and white it is the unexpected that always happens and yet humanity never gets accustomed to it the loafers white and black had assumed a sitting posture and then they had stood up for from the cars there had alighted the wonder of a stranger a negro stranger gorgeous of person and attire he was dressed in a suit of black cloth a long coat was buttoned close around his tall and robust form he was dead black from his shiny top hat to his not less shiny boots and about him there was the indefinable air of distinction he stood looking about the platform for a moment and then stepped briskly and decisively toward the group that was staring at him with wide eyes there was no hesitation in that step he walked as a man walks who is not in the habit of being stopped who has not known what it is to be told thus far shalt thou go and no further can you tell me where i can find the residence of mr isaac jackson he asked sonorously as he reached the stupefied loungers his voice was deep and clear someone woke from his astonishment and offered to lead him thither and together the two started for their destination the stranger keeping up a running fire of comment on the way had his companion been a close observer and known anything about the matter he would have found the newcomers english painfully unforgivably correct a language should be like an easy shoe on a flexible foot but to one unused to it it proves rather a splint on a broken limb the stranger stalked about in conversational splints until they arrived at isaac jacksons door then giving his guide a dime he dismissed him with a courtly bow and knocked it was a good thing that martha ann jackson had the innate politeness of her race well to the fore when she opened the door upon the radiant creature or she would have given voice to the words that were in her heart good lawd what is dis is this the residence of mr isaac jackson in the strangers suavest voice yes suh he live hyeah may i see him i desire to see him upon some business he handed her his card which she carefully turned upside down glanced at without understanding and put in her apron pocket as she replied he aint in jes now but ef youll step in an wait ill sen one o de chillen aftah him i thank you madam i thank you i will come in and rest from the fatigue of my journey i have travelled a long way and rest in such a pleasant and commodious abode as your own appears to be will prove very grateful to me she had been half afraid to invite this resplendent figure into her humble house but she felt distinctly flattered at his allusion to the home which she had helped isaac to buy and by the alacrity with which the stranger accepted her invitation she ushered him into the front room mentally thanking her stars that she had forced the reluctant isaac to buy a bright new carpet a couple of months before a child was despatched to find and bring home the father while martha ann hastily slipping out of her workdress and into a starched calico came in to keep her visitor company his name proved to be scatters and he was a most entertaining and ingratiating man it was evident that he had some important business with isaac jackson but that it was mysterious was shown by the guarded way in which he occasionally hinted at it as he tapped the valise he carried and nodded knowingly time had never been when martha ann jackson was so flustered she was charmed and frightened and flattered she could only leave mr scatters long enough to give orders to her daughter lucy to prepare such a supper as that household had never seen before then she returned to sit again at his feet and listen to his words of wisdom the supper progressed apace and the savour of it was already in the strangers nostrils upon this he grew eloquent and was about to divulge his secret to the hungryeyed woman when the trampling of isaacs boots upon the walk told him that he had only a little while longer to contain himself and at the same time to wait for the fragrant supper now it is seldom that a man is so well impressed with a smoothtongued stranger as is his wife usually his hardheadedness puts him on the defensive against the blandishments of the man who has won his better halfs favour and however honest the semifortunate individual may be he despises him for his attainments but it was not so in this case isaac had hardly entered the house and received his visitors warm handclasp before he had become captive to his charm business business no his guest had been travelling and he must be both tired and hungry isaac would hear of no business until they had eaten then over a pipe if the gentleman smoked they might talk at their ease mr scatters demurred but in fact nothing could have pleased him better and the open smile with which he dropped into his place at the table was very genuine and heartfelt genuine too were his praises of lucys cooking of her flaky buscuits and mealy potatoes he was pleased all through and he did not hesitate to say so it was a beaming group that finally rose heavily laden from the supper table over a social pipe a little later isaac jackson heard the story that made his eyes bulge with interest and his heart throb with eagerness mr scatters began tapping his hosts breast and looking at him fixedly you had a brother some years ago named john it was more like an accusation than a question yes suh i had a brothah john uh huh and that brother migrated to the west indies yes suh he went out to some o dem outlandish places hold on sir hold on i am a west indian myself i do mean no erfence ceptin dat john allus was of a rovin dispersition very well you know no more about your brother after his departure for the west indies no suh well it is my mission to tell you the rest of the story your brother john landed at cuba and after working about some years and living frugally he went into the coffee business in which he became rich rich rich sir why bless my soul whod a evah thought that of john why suh im sholy proud to hyeah it why dont he come home an visit a body ah why said mr scatters dramatically now comes the most painful part of my mission in the midst of life we are in death mr scatters sighed isaac sighed and wiped his eyes two years ago your brother departed this life was he saved isaac asked in a choked voice scatters gave him one startled glance and then answered hastily i am happy to say that he was poor john he gone an me lef even in the midst of our sorrows however there is always a ray of light your brother remembered you in his will remembered me remembered you and as one of the executors of his estate mr scatters rose and went softly over to his valise from which he took a large square package he came back with it holding it as if it were something sacred as one of the executors of his estate which is now settled i was commissioned to bring you this he tapped the package this package sealed as you see with the seal of cuba contains five thousand dollars in notes and bonds isaac gasped and reached for the bundle but it was withdrawn i am however not to deliver it to you yet there are certain formalities which my country demands to be gone through with after which i deliver my message and return to the fairest of lands to the gem of the antilles let me congratulate you mr jackson upon your good fortune isaac yielded up his hand mechanically he was dazed by the vision of this sudden wealth fi thousan dollahs he repeated yes sir five thousand dollars it is a goodly sum and in the meantime until court convenes i wish you to recommend some safe place in which to put this money as i do not feel secure with it about my person nor would it be secure if it were known to be in your house i reckon albert matthews grocery would be the safes place fu it hes got one o dem ion saftes the very place let us go there at once and after that i will not encroach upon your hospitality longer but attempt to find a hotel hotel nothin said isaac emphatically ef my house aint too common youll stay right thaih ontwell cot sets this is very kind of you mr jackson but really i couldnt think of being such a charge upon you and your good wife taint no charge on us well be glad to have you folks hyeah in miltonville has little enough compny de lawd knows isaac spoke the truth and it was as much the knowledge that he would be the envy of all the town as his gratitude to scatters that prompted him to prevail upon his visitor to stay scatters was finally persuaded and the men only paused long enough in the house to tell the curiosityeaten martha ann the news and then started for albert matthews store scatters carried the precious package and isaac was armed with an old shotgun lest anyone should suspect their treasure and attack them five thousand dollars was not to be carelessly handled as soon as the men were gone martha ann started out upon her rounds and her proud tongue did for the women portion of miltonville what the visit to matthews store did for the men did mrs soandso remember brother john indeed she did and when the story was told it was a well well well he used to be an ol beau o mine martha ann found no less than twenty women of her acquaintance for whom her brother john seemed to have entertained tender feelings the corner grocery store kept by albert matthews was the general gatheringplace for the coloured male population of the town it was a small oneroomed building almost filled with barrels boxes and casks pride as well as necessity had prompted isaac to go to the grocery just at this time when it would be quite the fullest of men he had not calculated wrongly when he reckoned upon the sensation that would be made by his entrance with the distinguishedlooking stranger the excitement was all the most hungry could have wished for the men stared at jackson and his companion with wideopen eyes they left off chewing tobacco and telling tales a halfdozen of them forgot to avail themselves of the joy of spitting and albert matthews the proprietor a weazened little brownskinned man forgot to lay his hand upon the scale in weighing out a pound of sugar with a humility that was false on the very face of it isaac introduced his guest to the grocer and the three went off together mysteriously into a corner the matter was duly explained and the object of the visit told matthews burned with envy of his neighbours good fortune i do reckon mistah scatters dat we bettah not let de othah folks in de sto know anything bout dis hyeah busness of ouahs i got to be sponsible fu dat money an i doesnt want to tek no chances you are perfectly right sir perfectly right you are responsible not only for the money itself but for the integrity of this seal which means the dignity of government matthews looked sufficiently impressed and together they all went their way among the barrels and boxes to the corner where the little safe stood with many turnings and twistings the door was opened the package inclosed and the safe shut again then they all rose solemnly and went behind the counter to sample something that matthews had this was necessary as a climax for they had performed not a mere deed but a ceremonial of course youll say nothing about this matter at all mr matthews said scatters thereby insuring publicity to his affair there were a few introductions as the men passed out but hardly had their backs turned when a perfect storm of comment and inquiry broke about the grocers head so it came to pass that with many mysterious nods and headshakings matthews first hinted at and then told the story for the first few minutes the men could scarcely believe what they had heard it was so utterly unprecedented then it dawned upon them that it might be so and discussion and argument ran rife for the next hour the story flew like wildfire there being three things in this world which interest all sorts and conditions of men alike great wealth great beauty and great love whenever mr scatters appeared he was greeted with deference and admiration any man who had come clear from cuba on such an errand to their fellowtownsman deserved all honour and respect his charming manners confirmed too all that preconceived notions had said of him he became a social favourite it began with mr and mrs dunkins calling upon him then followed alonzo taft and when the former two gave a reception for the visitor his position was assured miltonville had not yet arisen to the dignity of having a literary society he now founded one and opened it himself with an address so beautiful so eloquent and moving that mr dunkin bobbed his head dizzy in acquiescence and aunt hannah payne thought she was in church and shouted for joy the little town had awakened from its long postbellum slumber and accepted with eagerness the upward impulse given it it stood aside and looked on with something like adoration when mr scatters and mrs dunkin met and talked of ineffable things things far above the ken of the average mortal when mr scatters found that his mission was known he gave up further attempts at concealing it and talked freely about the matter he expatiated at length upon the responsibility that devolved upon him and his desire to discharge it and he spoke glowingly of the great government whose power was represented by the seal which held the package of bonds not for one day would he stay away from his beloved cuba if it were not that that seal had to be broken in the presence of the proper authorities so however reluctant he might be to stay it was not for him to shirk his task he must wait for the sitting of court meanwhile the jacksons lived in an atmosphere of glory the womenfolk purchased new dresses and isaac got a new wagon on the strength of their good fortune it was nothing to what they dreamed of doing when they had the money positively in hand mr scatters still remained their guest and they were proud of it what pleased them most was that their distinguished visitor seemed not to look down upon but rather to be pleased with their homely fare isaac had further cause for pleasure when his guest came to him later with a great show of frank confidence to request the loan of fifty dollars i should not think of asking even this small favour of you but that i have only cuban money with me and i knew you would feel distressed if you knew that i went to the trouble of sending this money away for exchange on account of so small a sum this was undoubtedly a mark of special confidence it suddenly made isaac feel as if the grand creature had accepted and labelled him as a brother and an equal he hastened to matthews safe where he kept his own earnings for the grocer was banker as well with reverent hands they put aside the package of bonds and together counted out the required half a hundred dollars in a little while mr scatters long graceful fingers had closed over it mr jacksons cup of joy was now full it had but one bitter drop to mar its sweetness that was the friendship that had sprung up between the cuban and mr dunkin they frequently exchanged visits and sat long together engaged in conversation from which isaac was excluded this galled him he felt that he had a sort of proprietary interest in his guest and any infringement of this property right he looked upon with distinct disfavour so that it was with no pleasant countenance that he greeted mr dunkin when he called on a certain night mr scatters is gone out he said as the old man entered and deposited his hat on the floor dats all right isaac said mr dunkin slowly i didnt come to see de gentman i come to see you the cloud somewhat lifted from isaacs brow mr dunkin was a man of importance and it made a deal of difference whom he was visiting he seemed a little bit embarrassed however as to how to open conversation he hummed and hawed and was visibly uneasy he tried to descant upon the weather but the subject failed him finally with an effort he hitched his chair nearer to his hosts and said in a low voice ike i reckon you has de confidence of mistah scatters i has was the proud reply i has hum uh huh well well has you evah loant him any money isaac was aghast such impertinence mistah dunkin he began i considah hol on ike broke in dunkin laying a soothing hand on the others knee don git on yo high hoss dis hyeahs a impotant mattah i aint got nothin to say he aint never tol you bout havin nothin but cubian money on him isaac started i see he have he tol me de same thing the two men sat staring suspiciously into each others faces he got a huned an fifty dollahs fom me said dunkin i let him have fifty added jackson weakly he got a huned an fifty dollahs fom thews dats how i come to git spicious he tol him de same stoy again that pregnant look flashed between them and they both rose and went out of the house they hurried down to matthews grocery the owner was waiting for them there there was solemnity but no hesitation in the manner with which they now went to the safe they took out the package hastily and with ruthless hands this was no ceremonial now the seal had no longer any fears for them they tore it off they tore the wrappers then paper neatly folded paper more wrapping paper newspapers nothing more of bills or bonds nothing with the debris of the mysterious parcel scattered about their feet they stood up and looked at each other i nevah did believe in furriners nohow said mr dunkin sadly but he knowed all about my brothah john an he sholy did make mighty fine speeches maybe wes missed de money this from the grocer together they went over the papers again with the same result do you know where he went tonight ike no den i reckon wes seed de las o him but he lef his valise yes an he lef dis said dunkin sternly pointing to the paper on the floor he sholy is mighty keerless of his valybles lets go git de constable said the practical matthews they did though they felt that it would be unavailing the constable came and waited at jacksons house they had been there about half an hour talking the matter over when what was their surprise to hear mr scatters step coming jauntily up the walk a sudden panic of terror and shame seized them it was as if they had wronged him suppose after all everything should come right and he should be able to explain they sat and trembled until he entered then the constable told him his mission mr scatters was surprised he was hurt indeed he was distinctly grieved that his friends had had so little confidence in him had he been to them anything but a gentleman a friend and an honest man had he not come a long distance from his home to do one of them a favour they hung their heads martha ann who was listening at the door was sobbing audibly what had he done thus to be humiliated he saw the effect of his words and pursued it had he not left in the care of one of their own number security for his integrity in the shape of the bonds the effect of his words was magical every head went up and three pairs of flashing eyes were bent upon him he saw and knew that they knew he had not thought that they would dare to violate the seal around which he had woven such a halo he saw that all was over and throwing up his hands with a despairing gesture he bowed graciously and left the room with the constable all miltonville had the story next day and waited no less eagerly than before for the settin of cot to the anger and chagrin of miltonvillians fox run had the honour and distinction of being the county seat and thither they must go to the sessions but never did they so forget their animosities as on the day set for the trial of scatters they overlooked the pride of the fox runners their cupidity and their vaunting arrogance they ignored the indignity of showing interest in anything that took place in that village and went in force eager anxious and curious ahorse afoot by oxcart by mulewagon white black high low old and young of both sexes invaded fox run and swelled the crowd of onlookers until with pity for the very anxiety of the people the humane judge decided to discard the now inadequate courtroom and hold the sessions on the village green here an impromptu bar was set up and over against it were ranged the benches chairs and campstools of the spectators every man of prominence in the county was present major richardson though now retired occupied a distinguished position within the bar old captain howard shook hands familiarly with the judge and nodded to the assembly as though he himself had invited them all to be present former judge durbin sat with his successor on the bench court opened and the first case was called it gained but passing attention there was bigger game to be stalked a hogstealing case fared a little better on account of the intimateness of the crime involved but nothing was received with such awed silence as the case of the state against joseph scatters the charge was obtaining money under false pretences and the plea not guilty the witnesses were called and their testimony taken mr scatters was called to testify in his own defence but refused to do so the prosecution stated its case and proceeded to sum up the depositions of the witnesses as there was no attorney for the defence the states attorney delivered a short speech in which the guilt of the defendant was plainly set forth it was as clear as day things looked very dark for mr scatters of cuba as the lawyer sat down and ere the case could be given to the jury he rose and asked permission of the court to say a few words this was granted him he stood up among them a magnificent strong black figure his eyes swept the assembly judge jury and spectators with a look half amusement half defiance i have pleaded not guilty he began in a low distinct voice that could be heard in every part of the inclosure and i am not guilty of the spirit which is charged against me however near the letter may touch me i did use certain knowledge that i possessed and the seal which i happened to have from an old government position to defraud that is the word if you will to defraud these men out of the price of their vanity and their cupidity but it was not a longpremeditated thing i was within a few miles of your town before the idea occurred to me i was in straits i stepped from the brink of great poverty into the midst of what you are pleased to deem a greater crime the court held its breath no such audacity had ever been witnessed in the life of fox run scatters went on warming to his subject as he progressed he was eloquent and he was pleasing a smile flickered over the face of major richardson and was reflected in the features of many others as the speaker burst forth gentlemen i maintain that instead of imprisoning you should thank me for what i have done have i not taught your community a lesson have i not put a check upon their credulity and made them wary of unheralded strangers he had there was no disputing that the judge himself was smiling and the jurymen were nodding at each other scatters had not yet played his trump card he saw that the time was ripe straightening his form and raising his great voice he cried gentlemen i am guilty according to the letter of the law but from that i appeal to the men who make and have made the law from the hard detail of this new day i appeal to the chivalry of the old south which has been told in story and sung in song from men of vindictiveness i appeal to men of mercy from plebeians to aristocrats by the memory of the sacred names of the richardsons the major sat bolt upright and dropped his snuffbox the durbins the exjudge couldnt for his life get his pincenez on the howards the captain openly rubbed his hands to the memory that those names call up i appeal and to the living and honourable bearers of them present and to you gentlemen of the jury the lives of whose fathers went to purchase this dark and bloody ground i appeal from the accusation of these men who are not my victims not my dupes but their own there was a hush when he was done the judge read the charge to the jury and it was favourable very and well scatters had taught the darkies a lesson he had spoken of their families and their traditions he knew their names and oh well he was a good fellow after all what was the use the jury did not leave their seats and the verdict was acquittal scatters thanked the court and started away but he met three ominouslooking pairs of eyes and a crowd composed of angry negroes was flocking toward the edge of the green he came back i think i had better wait until the excitement subsides he said to major richardson no need of that suh no need of that here jim he called to his coachman take mr scatters wherever he wants to go and remember i shall hold you responsible for his safety yes suh said jim a thousand thanks major said the man with the mission not at all suh by the way that was a very fine effort of yours this afternoon i was greatly moved by it if youll give me your address ill send you a history of our family suh from the time they left vuhginia and before mr scatters gave him the address and smiled at the three enemies who still waited on the edge of the green to the station he said to the driver four a matter of doctrine there was great excitement in miltonville over the advent of a most eloquent and convincing minister from the north the beauty about the rev thaddeus warwick was that he was purely and simply a man of the doctrine he had no emotions his sermons were never matters of feeling but he insisted so strongly upon the constant presentation of the tenets of his creed that his presence in a town was always marked by the enthusiasm and joy of religious disputation the rev jasper hayward coloured was a man quite of another stripe with him it was not so much what a man held as what he felt the difference in their characteristics however did not prevent him from attending dr warwicks series of sermons where from the vantage point of the gallery he drank in without assimilating that divines words of wisdom especially was he edified on the night that his white brother held forth upon the doctrine of predestination it was not that he understood it at all but that it sounded well and the words had a rich ring as he champed over them again and again mr hayward was a man for the time and knew that his congregation desired something new and if he could supply it he was willing to take lessons even from a white coworker who had neither de spiit ner de fiah because as he was prone to admit to himself dey was sumpin in de unnerstannin he had no idea what plagiarism is and without a single thought of wrong he intended to reproduce for his people the religious wisdom which he acquired at the white church he was an innocent beggar going to the doors of the wellprovided for cold spiritual victuals to warm over for his own family and it would not be plagiarism either for this very warmingover process would save it from that and make his own whatever he brought he would season with the pepper of his homely wit sprinkle it with the salt of his homemade philosophy then hot with the fire of his crude eloquence serve to his people a dish his very own but to the true purveyor of original dishes it is never pleasant to know that someone else holds the secret of the groundwork of his invention it was then something of a shock to the reverend mr hayward to be accosted by isaac middleton one of his members just as he was leaving the gallery on the night of this most edifying of sermons isaac laid a hand upon his shoulder and smiled at him benevolently how do brothah hayward he said you been sittin unner de drippins of de gospel too yes i has been listenin to de wods of my fellowlaborah in de vineyad of de lawd replied the preacher with some dignity for he saw vanishing the vision of his own glory in a revivified sermon on predestination isaac linked his arm familiarly in his pastors as they went out upon the street well what you tink erbout preodination an fodestination any how it sutny has been pussented to us in a powahful light dis evenin well suh hit opened up my eyes i do know when is hyeahed a sehmon dat

said the preacher well suh i will to you you knows miss sally briggs huh what say the reverend hayward had given a half discernible start and an exclamation had fallen from his lips what say repeated his companion i knows de sistah vey well she bein a membah of my flock well i been gwine in compny wit dat ooman fu de longes you aint nevah tasted none o huh cookin has you i has sperienced de

lookin wid de cookin eye hit seem lak i des fodestinated fu to may dat ooman you say you aint axe huh yit not yit but is gwine to ez soon ez evah i gets de chanst now uh huh said the preacher and he began to hasten his steps homeward seems lak you in a powful huy tonight said his companion with some difficulty accommodating his own step to the preachers masterly strides he was a short man and his pastor was tall and gaunt i has sompn on my min brothah middleton dat i wants to thrash out tonight in de sollertude of my own chambah was the solemn reply well i ain gwine keep erlong wid you an pestah you wid my chattah brothah hayward and at the next corner isaac middleton turned off and went his way with a cheery so long may de lawd set wid you in yo meddertations so long said his pastor hastily then he did what would be strange in any man but seemed stranger in so virtuous a minister he checked his hasty pace and after furtively watching middleton out of sight turned and retraced his steps in a direction exactly opposite to the one in which he had been going and toward the cottage of the very sister griggs concerning whose charms the ministers parishioner had held forth it was late but the pastor knew that the woman whom he sought was industrious and often worked late and with ever increasing eagerness he hurried on he was fully rewarded for his perseverance when the light from the window of his intended hostess gleamed upon him and when she stood in the full glow of it as the door opened in answer to his knock la brothah hayward ef it aint you howdy come in howdy howdy sistah griggs how you come on oh is des tolable industriously dusting a chair hows yosef is right smaht thankee maam wy brothah hayward aint you los down in dis paht of de town no indeed sistah griggs de sheperd aint nevah los no whaih deys any of de flock then looking around the room at the piles of ironed clothes he added you sutny is a industious ooman i was des bout finishin up some ionin i had fu de white folks smiled sister griggs taking down her ironingboard and resting it in the corner allus when i gits thoo my wok at nights is putty well tiahed out an has to eat a snack set by brothah

taint no hadah lookin out fu two dan it is lookin out fu one hayward flashed a quick upward glance at his hostess face and then repeated slowly yesm dat sutny is de trufe i aint nevah tought o that befo hit aint no hadah lookin out fu two dan hit is fu one and though he was usually an incessant talker he lapsed into a brown study be it known that the rev mr hayward was a man of a very level head and that his bachelorhood was a matter of economy he had long considered matrimony in the light of a most desirable estate but one which he feared to embrace until the rewards for his labours began looking up a little better but now the matter was being presented to him in an entirely different light hit aint no hadah lookin out fu two dan fu one might that not be the truth after all one had to have food it would take very little more to do for two one had to have a home to live in the same house would shelter two one had to wear clothes well now there came the rub but he thought of donation parties and smiled instead of being an extravagance might not this union of two beings be an economy somebody to cook the food somebody to keep the house and somebody to mend the clothes his reverie was broken in upon by sally griggs voice hit do seem lak you mighty deep in tought dis evenin brothah hayward i done spoke to you twicet scuse me sistah griggs my min has been mighty deeply sorbed in a little mattah o doctrine what you say to me i say set up to the table an have a bite to eat taint much but sich ez i have you know what de postle said the preachers eyes glistened as they took in the wellfilled board there was fervour in the blessing which he asked that made amends for its brevity then he fell to isaac middleton was right this woman was a genius among cooks isaac middleton was also wrong he a layman had no right to raise his eyes to her she was the prize of the elect not the quarry of any chance pursuer as he ate and talked his admiration for sally grew as did his indignation at middletons presumption meanwhile the fair one plied him with delicacies and paid deferential attention whenever he opened his mouth to give vent to an opinion an admirable wife she would make indeed at last supper was over and his chair pushed back from the table with a long sigh of content he stretched his long legs tilted back and said well you done settled de case ez fur ez i

hearty yes the rev mr hayward had sister sally close in his clerical arms they were not through their mutual felicitations which were indeed so enthusiastic as to drown the sound of a knocking at the door and the ominous scraping of feet when the door opened to admit isaac middleton just as the preacher was imprinting a very decided kiss upon his fiancees cheek wha wha exclaimed middleton the preacher turned dat you isaac he said complacently you must scuse ouah pearance we des got ingaged the fair sally blushed unseen what cried isaac ingaged aftah what i tol you tonight his face was a thundercloud yes suh an is dat de way you stan up fu fodestination this time it was the preachers turn to darken angrily as he replied look ahyeah ike middleton all i got to say to you is dat whenevah

pregnant with tragic possibilities the lady still stood with bowed head but her hand had stolen into her ministers isaac paused and the situation overwhelmed him crushed with anger and defeat he turned toward the door on the threshold he paused again to say well all i got to say to you hayward don you nevah talk to me no mor nuffin bout doctrine five old abes conversion the negro population of the little southern town of danvers was in a state of excitement such as it seldom reached except at revivals baptisms or on emancipation day the cause of the commotion was the anticipated return of the rev abram dixons only son robert who having taken up his fathers lifework and graduated at one of the schools had been called to a city church when roberts ambition to take a college course first became the subject of the village gossip some said that it was an attempt to force providence if robert were called to preach they said he would be endowed with the power from on high and no intervention of the schools was necessary abram dixon himself had at first rather leaned to this side of the case he had expressed his firm belief in the theory that if you opened your mouth the lord would fill it as for him he had no thought of what he should say to his people when he rose to speak he trusted to the inspiration of the moment and dashed blindly into speech coherent or otherwise himself a plantation exhorter of the ancient type he had known no school except the fields where he had ploughed and sowed the woods and the overhanging sky he had sat under no teacher except the birds and the trees and the winds of heaven if he did not fail utterly if his labour was not without fruit it was because he lived close to nature and so near to natures god with him religion was a matter of emotion and he relied for his results more upon a command of feeling than upon an appeal to reason so it was not strange that he should look upon his sons determination to learn to be a preacher as unjustified by the real demands of the ministry but as the boy had a will of his own and his father a boundless pride in him the day came when despite wagging heads robert dixon went away to be enrolled among the students of a growing college since then six years had passed robert had spent his school vacations in teaching and now for the first time he was coming home a fullfledged minister of the gospel it was rather a shock to the old mans sensibilities that his sons congregation should give him a vacation and that the young minister should accept but he consented to regard it as of the new order of things and was glad that he was to have his boy with him again although he murmured to himself as he read his sons letter through his bonebowed spectacles vacation vacation an i wonder ef he reckons de devils goin to take one at de same time it was a joyous meeting between father and son the old man held his boy off and looked at him with proud eyes why robbie he said you yous a man thats what im trying to be father the young mans voice was deep and comported well with his fine chest and broad shoulders yous a bigger man den yo father ever was said his mother admiringly oh well father never had the advantage of playing football the father turned on him aghast playin football he exclaimed you dont mean to tell me dat dey lowed men learnin to be preachers to play sich games oh yes they believe in a sound mind in a sound body and one seems to be as necessary as the other in fighting evil abram dixon shook his head solemnly the world was turning upside down for him football he muttered as they sat down to supper robert was sorry that he had spoken of the game because he saw that it grieved his father he had come intending to avoid rather than to combat his parents prejudices there was no condescension in his thought of them and their ways they were different that was all he had learned new ways they had retained the old even to himself he did not say but my way is the better one his father was very full of eager curiosity as to his sons conduct of his church and the son was equally glad to talk of his work for his whole soul was in it we do a good deal in the way of charity work among the churchless and almost homeless city children and father it would do your heart good if you could only see the little ones gathered together learning the first principles of decent living mebbe so replied the father doubtfully but what you doin in de way of teachin dem to die decent the son hesitated for a moment and then he answered gently we think that one is the companion of the other and that the best way to prepare them for the future is to keep them clean and good in the present do you give em good strong doctern er do you give em milk and water i try to tell them the truth as i see it and believe it i try to hold up before them the right and the good and the clean and beautiful humph exclaimed the old man and a look of suspicion flashed across his dusky face i want you to preach fer me sunday it was as if he had said i have no faith in your style of preaching the gospel i am going to put you to the test robert faltered he knew his preaching would not please his father or his people and he shrank from the ordeal it seemed like setting them all at defiance and attempting to enforce his ideas over their own then a perception of his cowardice struck him and he threw off the feeling that was possessing him he looked up to find his father watching him keenly and he remembered that he had not yet answered i had not thought of preaching here he said but i will relieve you if you wish it de folks will want to hyeah you an see what you kin do pursued his father tactlessly you know dey was a lot of em dat said i oughnt ha let you go away to school i hope youll silence em robert thought of the opposition his fathers friends had shown to his ambitions and his face grew hot at the memory he felt his entire inability to please them now i dont know father that i can silence those who opposed my going away or even please those who didnt but i shall try to please one it was now thursday evening and he had until saturday night to prepare his sermon he knew danvers and remembered what a chill fell on its congregations white or black when a preacher appeared before them with a manuscript or notes so out of concession to their prejudices he decided not to write his sermon but to go through it carefully and get it well in hand his work was often interfered with by the frequent summons to see old friends who stayed long not talking much but looking at him with some awe and a good deal of contempt his trial was a little sorer than he had expected but he bore it all with the goodnatured philosophy which his school life and work in a city had taught him the sunday dawned a beautiful southern summer morning the lazy hum of the bees and the scent of wild honeysuckle were in the air the sabbath was full of the quiet and peace of god and yet the congregation which filled the little chapel at danvers came with restless and turbulent hearts and their faces said plainly rob dixon we have not come here to listen to gods word we have come here to put you on trial do you hear on trial and the thought on trial was ringing in the young ministers mind as he rose to speak to them his sermon was a very quiet practical one a sermon that sought to bring religion before them as a matter of everyday life it was altogether different from the torrent of speech that usually flowed from that pulpit the people grew restless under this spiritual reserve they wanted something to sanction something to shout for and here was this man talking to them as simply and quietly as if he were not in church as uncle isham jones said de man never fetched an amen and the people resented his ineffectiveness even roberts father sat with his head bowed in his hands broken and ashamed of his son and when without a flourish the preacher sat down after talking twentytwo minutes by the clock a shiver of surprise ran over the whole church his father had never pounded the desk for less than an hour disappointment even disgust was written on every face the singing was spiritless and as the people filed out of church and gathered in knots about the door the oldtime headshaking was resumed and the comments were many and unfavourable dats what his schoolin done fo him said one it wasnt nothin mon a lecter was anothers criticism put him side o his father said one of the rev abram dixons loyal members and bless my soul de ol man would preach all roun him and he aint been to no college neither robert and his father walked home in silence together when they were in the house the old man turned to his son and said is dat de way dey teach you to preach at college i followed my instructions as nearly as possible father well lawd hep dey preachin den why befo id ha been in dat pulpit five minutes id ha had dem people moanin an hollerin all over de church and would they have lived any more cleanly the next day the old man looked at his son sadly and shook his head as at one of the unenlightened robert did not preach in his fathers church again before his visit came to a close but before going he said i want you to promise me youll come up and visit me father i want you to see the work i am trying to do i dont say that my way is best or that my work is a higher work but i do want you to see that i am in earnest i aint doubtin you mean well robbie said his father but i guess id be a good deal out o place up thaih no you wouldnt father you come up and see me promise me and the old man promised it was not however until nearly a year later that the rev abram dixon went up to visit his sons church robert met him at the station and took him to the little parsonage which the young clergymans people had provided for him it was a very simple place and an aged woman served the young man as cook and caretaker but abram dixon was astonished at what seemed to him both vainglory and extravagance aint you livin kin o high fo yo raisin robbie he asked the young man laughed if youd see how some of the people live here father youd hardly say so abram looked at the chintzcovered sofa and shook his head at its luxury but robert on coming back after a brief absence found his father sound asleep upon the comfortable lounge on the next day they went out together to see something of the city by the habit of years abram dixon was an early riser and his son was like him so they were abroad somewhat before business was astir in the town they walked through the commercial portion and down along the wharves and levees on every side the same sight assailed their eyes black boys of all ages and sizes the waifs and strays of the city lay stretched here and there on the wharves or curled on doorsills stealing what sleep they could before the relentless day should drive them forth to beg a pittance for subsistence such as these we try to get into our flock and do something for said robert his father looked on sympathetically and yet hardly with full understanding there was poverty in his own little village yes even squalour but he had never seen anything just like this at home almost everyone found some open door and rare was the wanderer who slept outofdoors except from choice at nine oclock they went to the police court and the old minister saw many of his race appear as prisoners receiving brief attention and long sentences finally a boy was arraigned for theft he was a little wobegone fellow hardly ten years of age he was charged with stealing cakes from a bakery the judge was about to deal with him as quickly as with the others and abrams heart bled for the child when he saw a negro call the judges attention he turned to find that robert had left his side there was a whispered consultation and then the old preacher heard with joy as this is his first offence and a trustworthy person comes forward to take charge of him sentence upon the prisoner will be suspended robert came back to his father holding the boy by the hand and together they made their way from the crowded room im so glad im so glad said the old man brokenly we often have to do this we try to save them from the first contact with the prison and all that it means there is no reformatory for black boys here and they may not go to the institutions for the white so for the slightest offence they are sent to jail where they are placed with the most hardened criminals when released they are branded forever and their course is usually downward he spoke in a low voice that what he said might not reach the ears of the little ragamuffin who trudged by his side abram looked down on the child with a sympathetic heart what made you steal dem cakes he asked kindly i was hongry was the simple reply the old man said no more until he had reached the parsonage and then when he saw how the little fellow ate and how tenderly his son ministered to him he murmured to himself feed my lambs and then turning to his son he said robbie deys somepn in dis deys somepn in it i tell you that night there was a boys class in the lower room of robert dixons little church boys of all sorts and conditions were there and abram listened as his son told them the old sweet stories in the simplest possible manner and talked to them in his cheery practical way the old preacher looked into the eyes of the street gamins about him and he began to wonder some of them were fierce unrulylooking youngsters inclined to meanness and rowdyism but one and all they seemed under the spell of their leaders voice at last robert said boys this is my father hes a preacher too i want you to come up and shake hands with him then they crowded round the old man readily and heartily and when they were outside the church he heard them pause for a moment and then three rousing cheers rang out with the vociferated explanation fo de ministers pap abram held his sons hand long that night and looked with teardimmed eyes at the boy i didnt understan he said i didnt understan youll preach for me sunday father i wouldnt daih honey i wouldnt daih oh yes you will pap he had not used the word for a long time and at sound of it his father yielded it was a strange service that sunday morning the son introduced the father and the father looking at his son who seemed so short a time ago unlearned in the ways of the world gave as his text a little child shall lead them he spoke of his own conceit and vainglory the pride of his age and experience and then he told of the lesson he had learned why people he said i feels like a new convert it was a gentler gospel than he had ever preached before and in the congregation there were many eyes as wet as his own robbie he said when the service was over i believe i had to come up here to be converted and robbie smiled six the race question

going on on the lower floor of the house number ten d street house number ten was the middle one of a row of more frames which formed what was put down on the real estate agents list as a coloured neighbourhood the inhabitants of the little cottages were people so poor that they were constantly staggering on the verge of the abyss which they had been taught to dread and scorn and why clearly life with them was no dream but a hard terrible reality which meant increasing struggle and little wonder then that the children of such parents should see the day before christmas come without hope of any holiday cheer christmas what did it mean to them the pitiful little dark ragmuffins save that the happy welldressed people who passed the shanties seemed further away from their life save that mother toiled later in the evening at her work if there was work and that father drank more gin and prayed louder in consequence save that perhaps and there was always a donation that there might be a little increase in the amount of cold victuals that big sister brought home and there might be turkeydressing in it but there was a warm discussion in number ten and that is the principal thing the next in importance is that miss arabella coe reporter who had been down that way looking mainly for a christmas story heard the sound of voices raised in debate and paused to listen it was not a very polite thing for miss coe to do but then miss coe was a reporter and reporters are not scrupulous about being polite when there is anything to hear besides the pitch to which the lusty young voices within were raised argued that the owners did not care if the outside world shared in the conversation so arabella listened and after a while she passed through the gate and peeped into the room between the broken slats of a shutter it was a mean little place quite what might be expected from its exterior a cook stove sat in the middle of the floor with a smoky fire in it and about it were clustered four or five black children ranging from a toddler of two to a boy of ten they all showed differing degrees of dirt and raggedness but all were far and beyond the point of respectability one of the group the older boy sat upon the bed and was holding forth to his brothers and sisters not without many murmurs of doubt and disbelief no he was saying i tell you dey haint no such thing as a santy claus dats somepn dat yo folks jes git up to make you be good long bout christmas time i know but tom you know what mammy said said a dreamyeyed little chap who sat on a broken stool with his chin on his hands aw mammy said the orator shes jes astuffin you she don believe in no santy claus hersel lessn whynt he bring huh de dress she prayed fu last christmas he was very wise this old man of ten years and he had sold papers on the avenue where many things are learned both good and bad but what you got to say about pappy pursued the believer he say deys a santy claus and dat he comes down de chimbly and whuts de mattah wid you look at dat stove pipe how you spose anybody gon to git in hyeah thoo de chimbly they all looked up at the narrow rusty stove pipe and the sigh of hopelessness brought the tears to arabellas eyes the children seemed utterly nonplussed and tom was swelling at his triumph hows any santy claus gon to come down thoo that i want to know he repeated but the faith of childhood is stronger than reason toms little sister piped up i dont know how but he comes throo that away anyhow he brung mamie davith a doll and it had thoot on it out o the chimbly it was now toms turn to be stumped but he wouldnt let it be known he only said aw contemptuously and coughed for more crushing arguments i knows deys a santy claus said dreamyeyed sam ef dey is whynt he never come here retorted tom i jes been thinkin maybe ouah house is so little he miss it in de night dey says hes a ol man an i low his sight ain good tom was stricken into silence for a moment by this entirely new view of the matter and then finding no answer to it he said aw again and looked superior but warningly so maybe thantys white an don go to see colred people said the little girl but i do know coloured peoples houses hes been at contended sam aw dem colred folks dats got the money dems de only ones dat santy claus fins you bet arabella at the window shuddered at the tone of the sceptic it reminded her so much of the world she knew and it was hard to believe that her friends who prided themselves on their unbelief could have anything in common with a little coloured newsboy down on d street tell you what said sam again lets try an see if dey is a santy well put a light in the winder so if hes ol he can see us anyhow an well pray right hard fu him to come aw said tom ith been good all thish month chirped the little girl the other children joined with enthusiasm in sams plan though tom sat upon the bed and looked scornfully on arabella escaped from the window just as sam brought the smoky lamp and set it on the sill but she still stood outside the palings of the fence and looked in she saw four little forms get down on their knees and she crept up near again to hear following sams lead they began oh santy but toms voice broke in dont you know the lord dont low you to pray to nobody but him sam paused puzzled for a minute then he led on please scuse good lord we started wrong but wont you please sir send santy clause around amen and they got up from their knees satisfied aw said tom as arabella was turning weteyed away it was a good thing the reporter left as soon as she did for in a few minutes a big woman pushed in at the gate and entered the house mammy mammy shrieked the children lawsy me said martha laughing who evah did see sich children bless dey hearts an dey done sot dey lamp in de winder too sos dey po ol mammy kin see to git in as she spoke she was taking the lamp away to set it on the table where she had placed her basket but the cry of the children stopped her oh no mammy dont take it dont take it dats to light santy claus in she paused a minute bewildered and then the light broke over her face she smiled and then a rush of tears quenched the smile she gathered the children into her arms and said is feared honey ol man santy ain gwine fu you tonight wahd i tell you sneered tom you hush yo mouf said his mother and she left the lamp where it was as arabella coe wended her way home that night her brain was busy with many thoughts ive got my story at last she told herself and ill go on up and write it but she did not go up to write it she came to the parting of the ways one led home the other to the newspaper office where she worked she laughed nervously and took the former way once in her room she went through her small store of savings there was very little there then she looked down ruefully at her worn boots she did need a new pair then holding her money in her hand she sat down to think its really a shame she said to herself those children will have no christmas at all and theyll never believe in santa claus again they will lose their faith forever and from this it will go to other things she sat there dreaming for a long while and the vision of a very different childhood came before her eyes dear old place she murmured softly i believed in santa claus until i was thirteen and that oldest boy is scarcely ten suddenly she sprung to her feet hooray she cried ill be defender of the faith and she went out into the lighted streets again the shopkeepers looked queerly at arabella that night as she bought as if she were the mother of a large and growing family and she appeared too young for that finally there was a dress for mother she carried them down on d street and placed them stealthily at the door of number ten she put a note among the things which read i am getting old and didnt see your house last year also i am getting fat and couldnt get down that little stove pipe of yours this year you must excuse me santa claus then looking wilfully at her shoes but nevertheless with a glow on her face she went up to the office to write her story there were joyous times at number ten the next day mother was really surprised and the children saw it whad i tell you said dreamy sam tom said nothing then but when he went down to the avenue to sell the morning papers all resplendent in a new muffler he strode up to a boy and remarked belligerently say if you says de aint no santy claus again ill punch yo head eight cahoots in the centre of the quaint old virginia graveyard stood two monuments side by side two plain granite shafts exactly alike on one was inscribed the name robert vaughan fairfax and the year on the other was the simple and perplexing inscription cahoots nothing more the place had been the orchard of one of the antebellum mansions before the dead that were brought back from the terrible field of malvern hill and laid there had given it a start as a cemetery many familiar names were chiselled on the granite headstones and anyone conversant with virginia genealogy would have known them to belong to some of the best families of the old dominion but cahoots who or what was he my interest not to say curiosity was aroused there must be a whole story in those two shafts with their simple inscriptions a lifedrama or perhaps a tragedy and who was more likely to know it than the postmaster of the quaint little old town just after the war as if tired with its exertions to repel the invader the old place had fallen asleep and was still drowsing i left the cemetery if such it could be called and wended my way up the main street to the ancient building which did duty as postoffice the man in charge a grizzled old fellow with an empty sleeve sat behind a small screen he looked up as i entered and put out his hand toward the mailboxes waiting for me to mention my name but instead i said i am not expecting any mail i only wanted to ask a few questions well sir what can i do for you he asked with some interest ive just been up there walking through the cemetery i returned and i am anxious to know the story if there be one of two monuments which i saw there you mean fairfax and cahoots yes youre a stranger about here of course yes i said again and so there is a story there is a story and ill tell it to you come in and sit down he opened a wire door into his little cage and i seated myself on a stool and gave my attention to him its just such a story he began as you can hear in any of the southern states wherever there were good masters and faithful slaves this particular tale is a part of our county history and there aint one of the old residents but could tell it to you word for word and fact for fact in the days before our misunderstanding with the north the fairfaxes were the leading people in this section by leading i mean not only the wealthiest not only the biggest landowners but that their name counted for more in social circles and political councils than any other hereabout it is natural to expect that such a family should wish to preserve its own name down a direct line so it was a source of great grief to old fairfax that his first three children were girls pretty healthy plump enough little things but girls for all that and consequently a disappointment to their fathers pride of family when the fourth child came and it proved to be a boy the fairfax plantation couldnt hold the fairfax joy and it flowed out and mellowed the whole county they do say that fairfax fairfax was in one of his further tobacco fields when the good news was brought to him and that after giving orders that all the darkies should knock off work and take a holiday in his haste and excitement he jumped down from his horse and ran all the way to the house i give the story only for what it is worth but if it is true it is the first case of a man of that name and family forgetting himself in an emergency well of course the advent of a young male fairfax would under any circumstances have proven a great event although it was afterwards duplicated but there would have been no story to tell there would have been no cahoots if by some fortuitous circumstance one of the slave women had not happened to bring into the world that day and almost at the same time that her mistress was introducing young vaughan fairfax to the light a little black pickaninny of her own well if youre a southern man and i take it that you are you know that nothing ever happens in the quarters that the big house doesnt know so the news was soon at the white fathers ears and nothing would do him but that the black baby must be brought to the house and be introduced to the white one the little black fellow came in all rolled in his bundle of shawls and was laid for a few minutes beside his little lord and master side by side they lay blinking at the light equally strange to both and then the master took the black childs hand and put it in that of the whites with the convulsive gesture common to babyhood the little hands clutched in a feeble grasp dah now old doshy said she was the nurse that had brought the pickaninny up dey done tol each othah howdy told each other howdy nothing said old fairfax solemnly they have made a silent compact of eternal friendship and i propose to ratify it right here he was a religious man and so there with all the darkies clustered around in superstitious awe and with the white face of his wife looking at him from among the pillows he knelt and offered a prayer and asked a blessing upon the two children just come into the world and through it all those diminutive specimens of humanity lay there blinking with their hands still clasped well they named the white child robert vaughan and they began calling the little darky ben until an incident in later life gave him the name that clung to him till the last and which the fairfaxes have had chiseled on his tombstone the incident occurred when the two boys were about five years old they were as thick as thieves and two greater scamps and greater cronies never tramped together over a virginia plantation in the matter of deviltry they were remarkably precocious and it was really wonderful what an amount of mischief those two could do as was natural the white boy planned the deeds and the black one was his willing coadjutor in carrying them out meanwhile the proud father was smilingly indulgent to their pranks but even with him the climax was reached when one of his fine young hounds was nearly driven into fits by the clatter of a tin can tied to its tail then the two culprits were summoned to appear before the paternal court of inquiry they came hand in hand and with no great show of fear or embarrassment they had gotten off so many times before that they were perfectly confident of their power in this case to cajole the judge but to their surprise he was all sternness and severity now look here he said after expatiating on the cruel treatment which the dog had received i want to know which one of you tied the can to spots tail robert vaughan looked at ben and ben looked back at him silence there and nothing more do you hear my question old fairfax asked with rising voice robert vaughan looked straight ahead of him and ben dug his big toe into the sand at the foot of the veranda but neither answered robert vaughan fairfax said his father who played that trick on spot answer me do you hear the fairfax heir seemed suddenly to have grown deaf and dumb and the father turned to the black boy his voice took on the tone of command which he had hardly used to his son who played that trick on spot answer me ben the little darky dug harder and harder into the sand and flashed a furtive glance from under his brows at his fellowconspirator then he drawled out i done it you didnt came back the instant retort from his young master i did it myself i done it repeated ben and you didnt reiterated his young master the father sat and looked on at the dispute and his mouth twitched suspiciously but he spoke up sternly well if i cant get the truth out of you this way ill try some other plan mandy he hailed a servant put these boys on a diet of bread and water until they are ready to answer my questions truthfully the culprits were led away to their punishment of course it would have just been meat to mandy to have stolen something to the youngsters but her master kept such a close eye upon her that she couldnt and when brought back at the end of three hours their fare had left the prisoners rather hungry but they had evidently disputed the matter between themselves and from the cloud on their faces when they reappeared before their stern judge it was still unsettled to the repetition of the question vaughan answered again i did it and then his father tried ben again after several efforts and an imploring glance at his boy master the little black stammered out well i reckon i reckon mas me an mas vaughan we done it in cahoots old fairfax fairfax had a keen sense of humour and as he looked down on the strangely old young darky and took in his answer the circumstance became too much for his gravity and his relaxing laugh sent the culprits rolling and tumbling in the sand in an ectasy of relief from the strained situation cahoots i reckon it was cahoots the judge said you ought to be named that you little black rascal well the story got around and so it was and from that day forth the black boy was cahoots cahoots whether on the plantation at home in the halls of the northern college where he accompanied his young master or in the tragic moments of the great wardrama played out on the field of malvern as they were in childhood so inseparable through youth and young manhood robert fairfax and cahoots grew up they were together in everything and when the call came that summoned the young virginian from his college to fight for the banner of his state cahoots was the one who changed from the ease of a gentlemans valet to the hardship of a soldiers bodyservant the last words fairfax fairfax said as his son cantered away in his gray suit were addressed to cahoots take good care of your mas vaughan cahoots and dont come back without him i wont mastah cahoots flung back and galloped after his lifelong companion well the war brought hard times both for master and man and there were no flowery beds of ease even for the officers who wore the gray robert fairfax took the fortunes of the conflict like a man and a virginia gentleman and with him cahoots it was at malvern hill that the young confederate led his troops into battle and all day long the booming of the cannon and the crash of musketry rising above the cries of the wounded and dying came to the ears of the slave waiting in his tent for his masters return then in the afternoon a scattered fragment came straggling back into the camp cahoots went out to meet them the firing still went on whahs mas bob his voice pierced through the cannons thunder he fell at the front early in the battle whahs his body den ef he fell we didnt have time to look for dead bodies in that murderous fire it was all we could do to get our living bodies away but i promised not to go back without him it was a wail of anguish from the slave well youll have to i wont whah did he fall someone sketched briefly the approximate locality of robert fairfaxs resting place and on the final word cahoots tore away the merciless shot of the federals was still raking the field but amid it all an old prairie schooner gotten from god knows where started out from the dismantled camp across the field some fool going to his death said one of the gray soldiers a ragged tattered remnant of the wagon came back the horses were bleeding and staggering in their steps the very harness was cut by the balls that had grazed it but with a light in his eyes and the look of a hero cahoots leaped from the tattered vehicle and began dragging out the body of his master he had found him far to the front in an abandoned position and brought him back over the field of the dead how did you do it they asked him i jes had to do it he said i promised not to go home widout him and i didnt keer ef i did git killed i wanted to die ef i couldnt find mas bobs body he carried the body home and mourned at the burial and a year later came back to the regiment with the son who had come after robert and was now just of fighting age he went all through this campaign and when the war was over the two struck away into the mountains they came back after a while neither one having taken the oath of allegiance and if there were any rebels cahoots was as great a one to the day of his death as his master that tombstone you see it looks old was placed there at the old masters request when his dead son came home from malvern hill for he said when cahoots went to the other side they must not be separated that accounts for its look of age but it was not until last year that we laid cahoots cahoots still though an old man beside his master and many a man that had owned his people and many another that had fought to continue that ownership dropped a tear on his grave nine the promoter even as early as september in the year of the newly emancipated had awakened to the perception of the commercial advantages of freedom and had begun to lay snares to catch the fleet and elusive dollar those controversialists who say that the negros only idea of freedom was to live without work are either wrong malicious or they did not know little africa when the boom was on when every little african fresh from the fields and cabins dreamed only of untold wealth and of mansions in which he would have been thoroughly uncomfortable these were the devils sunny days and early and late his mowers were in the field these were the days of benefit societies that only benefited the shrewdest man of mutual insurance associations of wild building companies and of giltedged land schemes wherein the unwary became bogged this also was the day of mr jason buford who having been free before the war knew a thing or two and now had set himself up as a promoter truly he had profited by the example of the white men for whom he had so long acted as messenger and factotum as he frequently remarked when for purposes of business he wished to air his biblical knowledge i jest takes the scripter fur my motter an foller that ol passage where it says make hay while the sun shines fur the night cometh when no man kin work it is related that one of mr bufords customers was an old plantation exhorter at the first suggestion of a biblical quotation the old gentleman closed his eyes and got ready with his best amen but as the import of the words dawned on him he opened his eyes in surprise and the amen died aborning but do hit say dat he asked earnestly it certainly does read that way said the promoter glibly uh huh replied the old man settling himself back in his chair i been preachin dat ting wrong fu mo dan foty yeahs dats whut comes o not bein able to read de wod fu yosef buford had no sense of the pathetic or he could never have done what he did sell to the old gentleman on the strength of the knowledge he had imparted to him a house and lot upon terms so easy that he might drowse along for a little time and then wake to find himself both homeless and penniless this was the promoters method and for so long a time had it proved successful that he had now grown mildly affluent and had set up a buggy in which to drive about and see his numerous purchasers and tenants buford was a suave little yellow fellow with a manner that suggested the training of some old southern butler father or at least an experience as a likely houseboy he was polite plausible and more than all resourceful all of this he had been for years but in all these years he had never so risen to the height of his own uniqueness as when he conceived and carried into execution the idea of the buford colonizing company humanity has always been looking for an eldorado and however mixed the metaphor may be has been searching for a moses to lead it thereto behold then jason buford in the rфle of moses and equipped he was to carry off his part with the very best advantage for though he might not bring water from the rock he could come as near as any other man to getting blood from a turnip the beauty of the mans scheme was that no offering was too small to be accepted indeed all was fish that came to his net think of paying fifty cents down and knowing that some time in the dim future you would be the owner of property in the very heart of a great city where people would rush to buy it was glowing enough to attract a people more worldly wise than were these late slaves they simply fell into the scheme with all their souls and off their half dollars dollars and larger sums mr buford waxed opulent the land meanwhile did not materialise it was just at this time that sister jane callender came upon the scene and made glad the heart of the newfledged moses he had heard of sister jane before and he had greeted her coming with a sparkling of eyes and a rubbing of hands that betokened a joy with a good financial basis the truth about the newcomer was that she had just about received her pension or that due to her deceased husband and she would therefore be rich rich to the point where avarice would lie in wait for her sis jane settled in mr bufords bailiwick joined the church he attended and seemed only waiting with her dollars for the very call which he was destined to make she was hardly settled in a little threeroom cottage before he hastened to her side kindly intent or its counterfeit beaming from his features he found a weaklooking old lady propped in a great chair while another stout and healthylooking woman ministered to her wants or stewed about the house in order to be doing something ah which which is sis jane callender he asked rubbing his hands for all the world like a clothing dealer over a good customer dats sis jane in de cheer said the animated one pointing to her charge she feelin mighty poly dis evenin what might be yo name she was promptly told sis jane hyeah one de good brothahs come to see you to offah his

anxiety and avarice what was this rich plum about to slip from his grasp just as he was about to pluck it it should not be he leaned over the old lady with intense eagerness in his gaze you must live to receive it he said we need that money for the race it must not go back to the white folks aint you got nobody to leave it to not a chick ner a chile ceptin sis dicey fairfax here mr buford breathed again then leave it to her by all means he said i don want to have nothin to do with de money of de daid said sis dicey fairfax now dont talk dat away sis dicey said the sick woman brother buford is

gwine to mek my will in yo favoh de lawds will be done replied the other with resignation and mr buford echoed with an amen he stayed very long that evening planning and talking with the two old women who received his words as the gospel two weeks later the ethiopian banner which was the organ of little africa announced that sis jane callender had received a back pension which amounted to more than five hundred dollars thereafter mr buford was seen frequently in the little cottage until one day after a lapse of three or four weeks a policeman entered sis jane callenders cottage and led her away amidst great excitement to prison she was charged with pension fraud and against her protestations was locked up to await the action of the grand jury the promoter was very active in his clients behalf but in spite of all his efforts she was indicted and came up for trial it was a great day for the denizens of little africa and they crowded the court room to look upon this stranger who had come among them to grow so rich and then suddenly to fall so low the prosecuting attorney was a young southerner and when he saw the prisoner at the bar he started violently but checked himself when the prisoner saw him however she made no effort at self control lawd o mussy she cried spreading out her black arms if it aint miss lous little bobby the judge checked the hilarity of the audience the prosecutor maintained his dignity by main force and the bailiff succeeded in keeping the old lady in her place although she admonished him pshaw chile you neednt fool wid me i nussed dat boys mammy when she borned him it was too much for the young attorney and he would have been less a man if it had not been he came over and shook her hand warmly and this time no one laughed it was really not worth while prolonging the case and the prosecution was nervous the way that old black woman took the court and its officers into her bosom was enough to disconcert any ordinary tribunal she patronised the judge openly before the hearing began and insisted upon holding a gentle motherly conversation with the foreman of the jury she was called to the stand as the very first witness what is your name asked the attorney now bobby what is you axin me dat fu you know what my name is and you one of de fairfax fambly too i low ef yo mammy was hyeah shed mek you membah shed put you in yo place the judge rapped for order that is just a manner of proceeding he said you must answer the question so the rest of the court may know oh yes suh scuse me my name hits dicey fairfax the attorney for the defence threw up his hands and turned purple he had a dozen witnesses there to prove that they had known the woman as jane callender but did you not give your name as jane callender i object

out of the ordinary lines i believe that my brother for the defence will have nothing to complain of i believe that i understand the situation and shall be able to get the truth more easily by employing methods that are not altogether technical the court seemed to understand a thing or two himself and overruled the defences objection now mrs fairfax aunt dicey snorted hoomph what mis

had to go an git killed in de wah an you you wy jedge ise spanked dat boy mo times den i kin tell you fu hus impidence i dont see how you evah gits erlong wid him the court repressed a ripple that ran around but there was no smile on the smoothshaven clearcut face of the young southerner turning to the attorney for the defence he said will you take the witness but that gentleman waving one helpless hand shook his head that will do then said young fairfax your honor he went on addressing the court i have no desire to prosecute this case further you all see the trend of it just as i see and it would be folly to continue the examination of any of the rest of these witnesses we have got that story from aunt dicey herself as straight as an arrow from a bow while technically she is guilty while according to the facts she is a criminal according to the motive and the intent of her actions she is as innocent as the whitest soul among us he could not repress the youthful southerners love for this little bit of rhetoric and i believe that nothing is to be gained by going further into the matter save for the purpose of finding out the whereabouts of this brother buford and attending to his case as the facts warrant but before we do this i want to see the stamp of crime wiped away from the name of my aunt dicey there and i beg leave of the court to enter a nolle prosse there is only one other thing i must ask of aunt dicey and that is that she return the money that was illegally gotten and give us information concerning the whereabouts of buford aunt dicey looked up in excitement wy chile ef dat money was got illegal i don want it but i do know whut i gwine to do cause i done vested it all wid brothah buford in his colorednization compny the court drew its breath it had been expecting some such dйnouement and where is the office of this company situated well i des cant tell dat said the old lady wy la man brothah buford was in cot today whaih is he brothah buford whaih you but no answer came from the surrounding spectators brother buford had faded away the old lady however after due conventions was permitted to go home it was with joy in her heart that aunt dicey fairfax went back to her little cottage after her dismissal but her face clouded when soon after robert fairfax came in hyeah you come as usual she said with wellfeigned anger tryin to sof soap me aftah you been carryin on you aint changed one mite fu all yo bein a man what you talk to me dat away in cot fu fairfaxs face was very grave it was necessary aunt dicey he said you know im a lawyer now and there are certain things that lawyers have to do whether they like it or not you dont understand that man buford is a scoundrel and he came very near leading you into a very dangerous and criminal act i am glad i was near to save you oh honey chile i didnt know dat set down an tell me all erbout it this the attorney did and the old ladys indignation blazed forth well i hope to de lawd youll fin dat rascal an larrup him ontwell he caint stan straight no were going to do better than that and a great deal better if we find him we are going to send him where he wont inveigle any more innocent people into rascality and youre going to help us wy sutny chile ill do all i kin to hep you git dat rascal but i dont know whaih he lives case hes allus come hyeah to see me hell come back some day in the meantime we will be laying for him aunt dicey was putting some very flaky biscuits into the oven and perhaps the memory of other days made the young lawyer prolong his visit and his explanation when however he left it was with welllaid plans to catch jason buford napping it did not take long stealthily that same evening a tapping came at aunt diceys door she opened it and a small crouching figure crept in it was mr buford he turned down the collar of his coat which he had had closely up about his face and said well well sis callender you sutny have spoiled us all la brothah buford come in hyeah an set down whaih you been i been hidin fu feah of that testimony you give in the court room what did you do that fu la me i didnt know you didnt splain to me in de fust well you see you spoiled it an ive got to git out of town as soon as i kin sis callender dese hyeah white people is mighty slippery and they might catch me but i want to beg you to go on away from hyeah sos you wont be hyeah to testify if dey does hyeahs a hundred dollars of yo money right down and you leave hyeah tomorrer mornin an go erway as far as you kin git la man is puffectly willin to hep you you know dat cose cose he answered hurriedly we colred people has got to stan together but what about de res of dat money dat i been vestin wid you im goin to pay intrus on that answered the promoter glibly all right all right aunt dicey had made several trips to the little back room just off her sitting room as she talked with the promoter three times in the window had she waved a lighted lamp three times without success but at the last all right she went into the room again this time the waving lamp was answered by the sudden flash of a lantern outside all right she said as she returned to the room set down an lemme fix you some suppah i aint hardly got the time i got to git away from hyeah but the smell of the new baked biscuits was in his nostrils and he could not resist the temptation to sit down he was eating hastily but with appreciation when the door opened and two minions of the law entered buford sprang up and turned to flee but at the back door her large form a towering and impassive barrier stood aunt dicey oh dont huy brothah buford she said calmly set down an hep yosef dese hyeahs my friends it was the next day that robert fairfax saw him in his cell the mans face was ashen with cowards terror he was like a caught rat though bitingly on the defensive you see weve got you buford said fairfax coldly to him it is as well to confess i aint got nothin to say said buford cautiously you will have something to say later on unless you say it now i dont want to intimidate you but aunt diceys word will be taken in any court in the united states against yours and i see a few years hard labour for you between good stout walls the little promoter showed his teeth in an impotent snarl what do you want me to do he asked weakening first i want you to give back every cent of the money that you got out of dicey fairfax second i want you to give up to every one of those negroes that you have cheated every cent of the property you have accumulated by fraudulent means third i want you to leave this place and never come back so long as god leaves breath in your dirty body if you do this i will save you you are not worth the saving from the pen or worse if you dont i will make this place so hot for you that hell will seem like an icebox beside it the little yellow man was cowering in his cell before the attorneys indignation his lips were drawn back over his teeth in something that was neither a snarl nor a smile his eyes were bulging and fearstricken and his hands clasped and unclasped themselves nervously i i he faltered do you want to send me out without a cent without a cent without a cent said fairfax tensely i wont do it the rat in him again showed fight i wont do it ill stay hyeah an fight you you cant prove anything on me all right all right and the attorney turned toward the door wait wait called the man i will do it my god i will do it jest let me out o hyeah dont keep me caged up ill go away from hyeah fairfax turned back to him coldly you will keep your word yes i will return at once and take the confession and so the thing was done jason buford stripped of his illgotten gains left the neighbourhood of little africa forever and aunt dicey no longer a wealthy woman and a capitalist is baking golden brown biscuits for a certain young attorney and his wife who has the bad habit of rousing her anger by references to her business name and her investments with a promoter ten the wisdom of silence jeremiah anderson was free he had been free for ten years and he was proud of it he had been proud of it from the beginning and that was the reason that he was one of the first to cast off the bonds of his old relations and move from the plantation and take up land for himself he was anxious to cut himself off from all that bound him to his former life so strong was this feeling in him that he would not consent to stay on and work for his onetime owner even for a full wage to the proposition of the planter and the gibes of some of his more dependent fellows he answered no suh is free an i sholy is able to tek keer o mysef i done been fattenin frogs fu othah peoples snakes too long now but jerry said samuel brabant i dont mean you any harm the things done you dont belong to me any more but naturally i take an interest in you and want to do what i can to give you a start its more than the northern government has done for you although such wise men ought to know that you have had no training in caring for yourselves there was a slight sneer in the southerners voice jerry perceived it and thought it directed against him instantly his pride rose and his neck stiffened nemmine me he answered nemmine me is free an wen a mans free hes free all right go your own way you may have to come back to me some time if you have to come come i dont blame you now it must be a great thing to you this dream this nightmare jerry looked at him oh it isnt a nightmare now but some day maybe it will be then come to me the master turned away from the newly made freeman and jerry went forth into the world which was henceforth to be his he took with him his few belongings these largely represented by his wife and four lustyeating children besides he owned a little money which he had got working for others when his masters task was done thus burdened and equipped he set out to tempt fortune he might do one of two things farm land upon shares for one of his shorthanded neighbours or buy a farm mortgage it and pay for it as he could as was natural for jerry and not uncommendable he chose at once the latter course bargained for his twenty acres for land was cheap then bought his mule built his cabin and set up his household goods now slavery may give a man the habit of work but it cannot imbue him with the natural thrift that long years of selfdependence brings there were times when jerrys freedom tugged too strongly at his easy inclination drawing him away to idle when he should have toiled what was the use of freedom asked an inward voice if one might not rest when one would if he might not stop midway the furrow to listen and laugh at a droll story or tell one if he might not go afishing when all the forces of nature invited and the jaybird called from the tree and gave forth saucy banter like the fiery blue shrew that she was there were times when his compunction held jerry to his task but more often he turned an end furrow and laid his misgivings snugly under it and was away to the woods or the creek there was joy and a loaf for the present what more could he ask the first year fortune laughed at him and her laugh is very different from her smile she sent the swift rains to wash up the new planted seed and the hungry birds to devour them she sent the fierce sun to scorch the young crops and the clinging weeds to hug the fresh greenness of his hope to death she sent cruellest jest of all another baby to be fed and so weakened cindy ann that for many days she could not work beside her husband in the fields poverty began to teach the unlessoned delver in the soil the thrift which he needed but he ended his first twelve months with barely enough to eat and nothing paid on his land or his mule broken and discouraged the words of his old master came to him but he was proud with an obstinate pride and he shut his lips together so that he might not groan he would not go to his master anything rather than that in that place sat certain beasts of prey dealers and lenders of money who had their lairs somewhere within the boundaries of that wide and mysterious domain called the law they had their risks to run but so must all beasts that eat flesh or drink blood to them went jerry and they were kind to him they gave him of their store they gave him food and seed but they were to own all that they gave him from what he raised and they were to take their toll first from the new crops now the black had been warned against these same beasts for others had fallen a prey to them even in so short a time as their emancipation measured and they saw themselves the remanacled slaves of a hopeless and evergrowing debt but jerry would not be warned he chewed the warnings like husks between his teeth and got no substance from them then fortune who deals in surprises played him another trick she smiled upon him his second year was better than his first and the brokers swore over his paid up note cindy ann was strong again and the oldest boy was big enough to help with the work samuel brabant was displeased not because he felt any malice toward his former servant but for the reason that any man with the natural amount of human vanity must feel himself agrieved just as his cherished prophecy is about to come true isaiah himself could not have been above it how much less then the uninspired mr brabant who had his i told you so all ready he had been ready to help jerry after giving him admonitions but here it was not needed an unused i told you so however kindly is an acid that turns the milk of human kindness sour jerry went on gaining in prosperity the third year treated him better than the second and the fourth better than the third during the fifth he enlarged his farm and his house and took pride in the fact that his oldest boy matthew was away at school by the tenth year of his freedom he was arrogantly out of debt then his pride was too much for him during all these years of his struggle the words of his master had been as gall in his mouth now he spat them out with a boast he talked much in the marketplace and where many people gathered he was much there giving himself as a bright and shining example huh he would chuckle to any listeners he could find ol mas brabant he say stay hyeah stay hyeah you do know how to tek keer o yosef yit but i des look at my two hans an i say to mysef whut i been doin wid dese all dese yeahs tekin keer o mysef an him too i wok in de fiel he set in de big house an smoke i wok in de fiel his son go away to college an come back a graduate das hit well wen freedom come i des bent an boun i ain gwine do it no mo an i didnt now look at me i sets down wen i wants to i does my own wokin an my own smokin i dont owe a cent an dis yeah my boy gwine graduate fom de school dats me an i ain called on ol mas yit now an example is always an odious thing because first of all it is always insolent even when it is bad and there were those who listened to jerry who had not been so successful as he some even who had stayed on the plantation and as yet did not even own the mule they ploughed with the hearts of those were filled with rage and their mouths with envy some of the sting of the latter got into their retelling of jerrys talk and made it worse than it was old samuel brabant laughed and said well jerrys not dead yet and although i dont wish him any harm my prophecy might come true yet there were others who hearing did not laugh or if they did it was with a mere strained thinning of the lips that had no element of mirth in it temper and tolerance were short ten years after sixtythree the foolish farmers boastings bore fruit and one night when he and his family had gone to church he returned to find his house and barn in ashes his mules burned and his crop ruined it had been very quietly done and quickly the glare against the sky had attracted few from the nearby town and them too late to be of service jerry camped that night across the road from what remained of his former dwelling cindy ann and the children worn out and worried went to sleep in spite of themselves but he sat there all night long his chin between his knees gazing at what had been his pride well the beasts lay in wait for him again and when he came to them they showed their fangs in greeting and the velvet was over their claws he had escaped them before he had impugned their skill in the hunt and they were ravenous for him now he was fatter too he went away from them with hard terms and a sickness at his heart but he had not said yes to the terms he was going home to consider the almost hopeless conditions under which they would let him build again they were staying with a neighbour in town pending his negotiations and thither he went to ponder on his circumstances then it was that cindy ann came into the equation she demanded to know what was to be done and how it was to be gone about but cindy ann honey you do know nuffin bout busness taint whut i knows but whut i got a right to know was her response i do see huccome you got any right

gets tired of thinking and saying how much more sense a woman has than a man when she comes in where his sense stops and his pride begins with the recklessness of despair jerry slept late that next morning but he might have awakened early without spoiling his wifes plans she was up betimes had gone on her mission and returned before her spouse awoke it was about ten oclock when brabant came to see him jerry grew sullen at once as his master approached but his pride stiffened this white man should see that misfortune could not weaken him well jerry said his former master you would not come to me eh so i must come to you you let a little remark of mine keep you from your best friend and put you in the way of losing the labour of years jerry made no answer youve proved yourself able to

between the two women the feud began in this way when ann pease divorced her handsome but profligate spouse william nancy rogers had with reprehensible haste taken him for better or for worse of course it proved for worse but ann pease had never forgiven her pears lak to me she said dat she was des awaitin fu to step inter my shoes no mattah how i got outen em whethah i died or divoced it was in the heyday of nancy rogers youth and she was still hottempered so she retorted that ann pease sutny did unmind huh o de dawg in de mangah the friends of the two women took sides and a war began which waged hotly between them a war which for the first few weeks threatened the unity of mt pisgah church but the church in all times has been something of a selfish institution and has known how to take care of itself now mt pisgah of necessity must recognise divorce and of equal necessity remarriage so when the rev isaiah johnson had been appealed to he had spread his fat hands closed his eyes and said solemnly whom god hath jined let no man put asundah peace or at best apparent peace settled upon the troubled waters the solidity of mt pisgah was assured the two factions again spoke to each other both gave collections on the same sunday but between the two principals there was no abatement of their relentless animosity ann pease as it happened was a puffessor while the new mrs pease was out of the fold a gay frivolous person who had never sought or found grace she laughed when a black wag said of the two that they might bofe be peas but dey wasnt out o de same pod but on its being repeated to sister pease she resented it with christian indignation sniffed and remarked that ef wiyum choosed to pick out one o de onregenerate an hang huh ez a millstone erroun his neck it wasnt none o huh busness what happened to him wen dey pulled up de tares fom de wheat there were some ultramalicious ones who said that sister pease seeing her former husband in the possession of another had begun to regret her step for the unregenerate william was goodlooking after all and the times that he and his equally sinful wife had together were the wonder and disgust the envy and horror of the whole community who watched them with varying moods of eagerness sister ann pease went her way apparently undisturbed religion has an arrogance of its own and when at the end of the year the good widow remained unmarried she could toss her head go her way and look down from a far height upon the po sinnahs indeed she had rather the better of her frailer sister in the sympathies of the people as one sister feelingly remarked dat ooman des baihin dat man in huh prayahs an i low shell moun him into glory yit one year of married life disillusions and defiant gaiety cannot live upon itself when admiration fails there is no reward in being daring when courage becomes commonplace the year darkened to winter and bloomed to spring again the willows feathered along the river banks and the horsechestnuts budded and burst into beautiful life then came summer rejoicing with arms full of flowers and autumn with lap full of apples and grain then winter again and all through the days nancy danced and was gay but there was a wistfulness in her eyes and the tug of the baby no longer drew her heart she had come to be wiyums nancy while the other that other was still sister pease who sat above her in the high places of the peoples hearts and then oh blessedness of the winter the revival came and both she and william strangely stricken together with the realisation of their sins fell at the mercy seat there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth but when will and nancy both came through on the same night well mt pisgahs walls know the story there was triumph in nancys face as she proclaimed her conversion and the first person she made for was sister pease she shook her hands and embraced her crying ever aloud between the vociferations of the congregation oh sistah hep me praise him hep me praise him and the elder woman in the cause caught the infection of the moment and joined in the general shout afterwards she was not pleased with herself but then if she hadnt shouted wouldnt it have been worse the rev isaiah was nothing if not dramatic in his tendencies and on the day when he was to receive william and nancy pease into full membership with the church it struck him that nothing could make upon his congregation a profounder impression for good than to have the two new peases joined by the elder one or as the wag would have put it all in one pod and it was so ordered and the thing was done it is true that the preacher had to labour some with sister ann pease but when he showed her how it was her christian duty and if she failed of it her rival must advance before her in public opinion she acquiesced it was an easier matter with sister wiyum pease she agreed readily for she was filled with condescending humility which on every occasion she took the opportunity of displaying toward her rival the rev isaiah johnson only made one mistake in his diplomatic manoeuvring that was when he whispered to sister ann pease didnt i tell you des see how easy sister wiyum give in he was near to losing his cause and the wind was completely taken out of his sails when the widow replied with a snort give in my lawd dat oomans got a right to give in aint she got uligion an de man too however the storm blew over and by the time service was begun they were all seated together on a front bench sister nancy william and sister ann now was the psychological moment and after a soulstirring hymn the preacher rose and announced his text behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity someone in the back part of the church suggested trinity as a substitute and started a titter but the preacher had already got his dramatic momentum and was sweeping along in a tumultuous tide of oratory right at his three victims did he aim his fiery eloquence and ever and again he came back to his theme behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity even though ann pease had turned her back on william whose head was low bowed and nancy was ostentatiously weeping into a yellow silk handkerchief the sermon spurred on to a tempestuous close and then came the climax when the doors of the church were opened william and nancy immediately went up to end their probation and after a few whispered remarks the minister shook hands with each of them then raising his voice he said now brothahs and sistahs befo you all gives dese lambs de right han o fellowship to welcome dem to de fol i want sister ann pease to come up an be de first to bid em god speed on the gospel way ann pease visibly swelled but she marched up and without looking at either shook hands with each of her enemies hallelujah praise de lord shouted the preacher clapping his hands behold how good and how pleasant it is and now let the congregation in gineral come aroun and welcome brothah and sistah pease his rich bass voice broke into bless be the tie that binds and as the volume of the hymn swelled by the full chorus of the congregation rolled away to the rafters of the little church the people rose and marched solemnly round shaking hands with the new members and with each other brother and sister pease were the last to leave church that day but they found ann waiting for them at the door she walked straight up to them and spoke nancy rogers she said i know you i kin see claih thoo you and you aint a foolin me one bit all i got to say is dat i has done my christian duty an i aint gwine do no mo so don you speak to me fom dis day out for the brief space of a second there was something like a gleam in nancys eyes but she replied in all meekness is a fullblown christian now an i feel it my bounden duty to speak to you sis pease an is gwine t speak ignoring this defiance the other woman turned to her former husband she looked at him with unveiled contempt then she said slowly an ez fu wiyum gawd hep you here all intercourse between these warring spirits might have ended but for nancy peases persistent civility she would speak to her rival on every occasion and even call upon her if she could gain admittance to the house and now the last drop of bitterness fell into the widows cup for the community to distinguish between them began calling her ol sis pease this was the climax of her sorrows and she who had been so devout came no more to the church she who had been so cheerful and companionable grew morose and sour and shut her doors against her friends she was as one dead to her old world the one bit of vivid life about her was her lasting hatred of the woman who bore her name in vain the preacher sought to break down the barrier of her animosity she had built it of adamant and his was a losing fight so for several years the feud went on and those who had known ann in her cheerier days forgot that knowledge and spoke of her with open aversion as dat awful ol mis pease the while nancy in spite of wiyums industrial vagaries had flourished and waxed opulent she continued to flaunt her christian humility in the eyes of her own circle and to withhold her pity from the poor lonely old woman whom hate had made bitter and to whom the world after all had not been overkind but prosperity is usually cruel and one needs the prick of the thorn ones self to know how it stings his brother she was startled one day however out of her usual placidity sister martin one of her neighbours dropped in and settling herself with a sigh announced the important news well bless gawd ol sis pease is gone at last nancy dropped the plate she had been polishing and unheeded it smashed into bits on the floor wha what she exclaimed yesm sister martin assured her de ol lady done passed away i didnt know she was sick wen she die she done shet huh eyes on dis worl o sorror des a few minutes ago she aint bin sick mon two days nancy had come to herself now and casting her eyes up in an excess of christian zeal she said well she wouldnt let me do nuffin fu huh in life but i sutny shell try to do my duty by huh in death and drying her hands and throwing a shawl over her head she hastened over to her dead enemys house the news had spread quickly and the neighbourhood had just begun to gather in the little room which held the rigid form nancy entered and made her way through the group about the bed waving the others aside imperiously it is my christian duty she said solemnly to lay sis pease out an is gwine do it she bent over the bed now there are a dozen truthful women who will vouch for the truth of what happened when nancy leaned over the bed as if in obedience to the power of an electric shock the corpses eyes flew open ann pease rose up in bed and pointing a trembling finger at her frightened namesake exclaimed go way fom me nancy rogers dont you daih to tech me you aint got de comeuppance of me yit dont you daih to lay me out most of this remark it seems fell on empty air for the room was cleared in a twinkling women holding high numerous skirts over their heavy shoes fled in a panic and close in their wake panted nancy pease there have been conflicting stories about the matter but there are those who maintain that after having delivered her ultimatum old mis pease immediately resumed the natural condition of a dead person in fact there was no one there to see and the old lady did not really die until night and when they found her there was a smile of triumph on her face nancy did not help to lay her out twelve the lynching of jube benson gordon fairfaxs library held but three men but the air was dense with clouds of smoke the talk had drifted from one topic to another much as the smoke wreaths had puffed floated and thinned away then handon gay who was an ambitious young reporter spoke of a lynching story in a recent magazine and the matter of punishment without trial put new life into the conversation i should like to see a real lynching said gay rather callously well i should hardly express it that way said fairfax but if a real live lynching were to come my way i should not avoid it i should spoke the other from the depths of his chair where he had been puffing in moody silence judged by his hair which was freely sprinkled with gray the speaker might have been a man of fortyfive or fifty but his face though lined and serious was youthful the face of a man hardly past thirty what you dr melville why i thought that you physicians wouldnt weaken at anything i have seen one such affair said the doctor gravely in fact i took a prominent part in it tell us about it said the reporter feeling for his pencil and notebook which he was nevertheless careful to hide from the speaker the men drew their chairs eagerly up to the doctors but for a minute he did not seem to see them but sat gazing abstractedly into the fire then he took a long draw upon his cigar and began i can see it all very vividly now it was in the summer time and about seven years ago i was practising at the time down in the little town of bradford it was a small and primitive place just the location for an impecunious medical man recently out of college in lieu of a regular office i attended to business in the first of two rooms which i rented from hiram daly one of the more prosperous of the townsmen here i boarded and here also came my patients white and black whites from every section and blacks from nigger town as the west portion of the place was called the people about me were most of them coarse and rough but they were simple and generous and as time passed on i had about abandoned my intention of seeking distinction in wider fields and determined to settle into the place of a modest country doctor this was rather a strange conclusion for a young man to arrive at and i will not deny that the presence in the house of my hosts beautiful young daughter annie had something to do with my decision she was a beautiful young girl of seventeen or eighteen and very far superior to her surroundings she had a native grace and a pleasing way about her that made everybody that came under her spell her abject slave white and black who knew her loved her and none i thought more deeply and respectfully than jube benson the black man of all work about the place he was a fellow whom everybody trusted an apparently steadygoing grinning sort as we used to call him well he was completely under miss annies thumb and would fetch and carry for her like a faithful dog as soon as he saw that i began to care for annie and anybody could see that he transferred some of his allegiance to me and became my faithful servitor also never did a man have a more devoted adherent in his wooing than did i and many a one of annies tasks which he volunteered to do gave her an extra hour with me you can imagine that i liked the boy and you need not wonder any more that as both wooing and my practice waxed apace i was content to give up my great ambitions and stay just where i was it wasnt a very pleasant thing then to have an epidemic of typhoid break out in the town that kept me going so that i hardly had time for the courting that a fellow wants to carry on with his sweetheart while he is still young enough to call her his girl i fumed but duty was duty and i kept to my work night and day it was now that jube proved how invaluable he was as a coadjutor he not only took messages to annie but brought sometimes little ones from her to me and he would tell me little secret things that he had overheard her say that made me throb with joy and swear at him for repeating his mistress conversation but best of all jube was a perfect cerberus and no one on earth could have been more effective in keeping away or deluding the other young fellows who visited the dalys he would tell me of it afterwards chuckling softly to himself an doctah i say to mistah hemp stevens scuse us mistah stevens but miss annie she des gone out an den he go outer de gate lookin moughty lonesome when sam elkins come i say sh mistah elkins miss annie she done tuk down an he say what jube you don reckon hit de den he stop an look skeert an i say i feared hit is mistah elkins an sheks my haid ez solemn he goes outer de gate lookin lak his bes frien done daid an all de time miss annie behine de cutain ovah de poch des a laffin fit to kill jube was a most admirable liar but what could i do he knew that i was a young fool of a hypocrite and when i would rebuke him for these deceptions he would give way and roll on the floor in an excess of delighted laughter until from very contagion i had to join him and well there was no need of my preaching when there had been no beginning to his repentance and when there must ensue a continuance of his wrongdoing this thing went on for over three months and then pouf i was down like a shot my patients were nearly all up but the reaction from overwork made me an easy victim of the lurking germs then jube loomed up as a nurse he put everyone else aside and with the doctor a friend of mine from a neighbouring town took entire charge of me even annie herself was put aside and i was cared for as tenderly as a baby tom that was my physician and friend told me all about it afterward with tears in his eyes only he was a big blunt man and his expressions did not convey all that he meant he told me how my nigger had nursed me as if i were a sick kitten and he my mother of how fiercely he guarded his right to be the sole one to do for me as he called it and how when the crisis came he hovered weeping but hopeful at my bedside until it was safely passed when they drove him weak and exhausted from the room as for me i knew little about it at the time and cared less i was too busy in my fight with death to my chimerical vision there was only a black but gentle demon that came and went alternating with a white fairy who would insist on coming in on her head growing larger and larger and then dissolving but the pathos and devotion in the story lost nothing in my blunt friends telling it was during the period of a long convalescence however that i came to know my humble ally as he really was devoted to the point of abjectness there were times when for very shame at his goodness to me i would beg him to go away to do something else he would go but before i had time to realise that i was not being ministered to he would be back at my side grinning and pottering just the same he manufactured duties for the joy of performing them he pretended to see desires in me that i never had because he liked to pander to them and when i became entirely exasperated and ripped out a good round oath he chuckled with the remark dah now you sholy is gittin well nevah did hyeah a man anywhaih nigh jodans sho cuss lak dat why i grew to love him love him oh yes i loved him as well oh what am i saying all human love and gratitude are damned poor things excuse me gentlemen this isnt a pleasant story the truth is usually a nasty thing to stand it was not six months after that that my friendship to jube which he had been at such great pains to win was put to too severe a test it was in the summer time again and as business was slack i had ridden over to see my friend dr tom i had spent a good part of the day there and it was past four oclock when i rode leisurely into bradford i was in a particularly joyous mood and no premonition of the impending catastrophe oppressed me no sense of sorrow present or to come forced itself upon me even when i saw men hurrying through the almost deserted streets when i got within sight of my home and saw a crowd surrounding it i was only interested sufficiently to spur my horse into a jog trot which brought me up to the throng when something in the sullen settled horror in the mens faces gave me a sudden sick thrill they whispered a word to me and without a thought save for annie the girl who had been so surely growing into my heart i leaped from the saddle and tore my way through the people to the house it was annie poor girl bruised and bleeding her face and dress torn from struggling they were gathered round her with white faces and oh with what terrible patience they were trying to gain from her fluttering lips the name of her murderer they made way for me and i knelt at her side she was beyond my skill and my will merged with theirs one thought was in our minds who i asked her eyes half opened that black she fell back into my arms dead we turned and looked at each other the mother had broken down and was weeping but the face of the father was like iron it is enough he said jube has disappeared he went to the door and said to the expectant crowd she is dead i heard the angry roar without swelling up like the noise of a flood and then i heard the sudden movement of many feet as the men separated into searching parties and laying the dead girl back upon her couch i took my rifle and went out to join them as if by intuition the knowledge had passed among the men that jube benson had disappeared and he by common consent was to be the object of our search fully a dozen of the citizens had seen him hastening toward the woods and noted his skulking air but as he had grinned in his old goodnatured way they had at the time thought nothing of it now however the diabolical reason of his slyness was apparent he had been shrewd enough to disarm suspicion and by now was far away even mrs daly who was visiting with a neighbour had seen him stepping out by a back way and had said with a laugh i reckon that black rascals arunning off somewhere oh if she had only known to the woods to the woods that was the cry and away we went each with the determination not to shoot but to bring the culprit alive into town and then to deal with him as his crime deserved i cannot describe the feelings i experienced as i went out that night to beat the woods for this human tiger my heart smouldered within me like a coal and i went forward under the impulse of a will that was half my own half some more malignant powers my throat throbbed drily but water nor whiskey would not have quenched my thirst the thought has come to me since that now i could interpret the panthers desire for blood and sympathise with it but then i thought nothing i simply went forward and watched watched with burning eyes for a familiar form that i had looked for as often before with such different emotions luck or illluck which you will was with our party and just as dawn was graying the sky we came upon our quarry crouched in the corner of a fence it was only half light and we might have passed but my eyes had caught sight of him and i raised the cry we levelled our guns and he rose and came toward us i tought you want gwine see me he said sullenly i didnt mean no harm harm some of the men took the word up with oaths others were ominously silent we gathered around him like hungry beasts and i began to see terror dawning in his eyes he turned to me is moughty glad yous hyeah doc he said you aint gwine let em whup me whip you you hound i said im going to see you hanged and in the excess of my passion i struck him full on the mouth he made a motion as if to resent the blow against even such great odds but controlled himself wy doctah he exclaimed in the saddest voice i have ever heard wy doctah i aint stole nuffin o yon an i was comin back i only run off to see my gal lucy ovah to de centah you lie i said and my hands were busy helping the others bind him upon a horse why did i do it i dont know a false education i reckon one false from the beginning i saw his black face glooming there in the half light and i could only think of him as a monster its tradition at first i was told that the black man would catch me and when i got over that they taught me that the devil was black and when i had recovered from the sickness of that belief here were jube and his fellows with faces of menacing blackness there was only one conclusion this black man stood for all the powers of evil the result of whose machinations had been gathering in my mind from childhood up but this has nothing to do with what happened after firing a few shots to announce our capture we rode back into town with jube the ingathering parties from all directions met us as we made our way up to the house all was very quiet and orderly there was no doubt that it was as the papers would have said a gathering of the best citizens it was a gathering of stern determined men bent on a terrible vengeance we took jube into the house into the room where the corpse lay at sight of it he gave a scream like an animals and his face went the colour of stormblown water this was enough to condemn him we divined rather than heard his cry of miss ann miss ann oh my god doc you dont tink i done it hungry hands were ready we hurried him out into the yard a rope was ready a tree was at hand well that part was the least of it save that hiram daly stepped aside to let me be the first to pull upon the rope it was lax at first then it tightened and i felt the quivering soft weight resist my muscles other hands joined and jube swung off his feet no one was masked we knew each other not even the culprits face was covered and the last i remember of him as he went into the air was a look of sad reproach that will remain with me until i meet him face to face again we were tying the end of the rope to a tree where the dead man might hang as a warning to his fellows when a terrible cry chilled us to the marrow cut im down cut im down he aint guilty we got de one cut him down fu gawds sake heres de man we foun him hidin in de barn jubes brother ben and another negro came rushing toward us half dragging half carrying a miserablelooking wretch between them someone cut the rope and jube dropped lifeless to the ground oh my gawd hes daid hes daid wailed the brother but with blazing eyes he brought his captive into the centre of the group and we saw in the full light the scratched face of tom skinner the worst white ruffian in the town but the face we saw was not as we were accustomed to see it merely smeared with dirt it was blackened to imitate a negros god forgive me i could not wait to try to resuscitate jube i knew he was already past help so i rushed into the house and to the dead girls side in the excitement they had not yet washed or laid her out carefully carefully i searched underneath her broken finger nails there was skin there i took it out the little curled pieces and went with it to my office there determinedly i examined it under a powerful glass and read my own doom it was the skin of a white man and in it were embedded strands of short brown hair or beard how i went out to tell the waiting crowd i do not know for something kept crying in my ears blood guilty blood guilty the men went away stricken into silence and awe the new prisoner attempted neither denial nor plea when they were gone i would have helped ben carry his brother in but he waved me away fiercely you heped murder my brothah you dat was his frien go way go way ill tek him home mysef i could only respect his wish and he and his comrade took up the dead man and between them bore him up the street on which the sun was now shining full i saw the few men who had not skulked indoors uncover as they passed and i i stood there between the two murdered ones while all the while something in my ears kept crying blood guilty blood guilty the doctors head dropped into his hands and he sat for some time in silence which was broken by neither of the men then he rose saying gentlemen that was my last lynching thirteen schwalligers philanthropy there is no adequate reason why schwalligers name should appear upon the pages of history he was decidedly not in good society he was not even respectable as respectability goes but certain men liked him and certain women loved him he is dead that is all that will be said of the most of us after a while he was but a weak member of the community but those who loved him did not condemn him and they shut their eyes to his shortcomings because they were a part of him without his follies he would not have been himself schwalliger was only a racehorse tout ah dont hold up your hands good friends for circumstances of birth make most of us what we are whether poets or pickpockets and if this thickset bowlegged black man became a tout it was because he had to old horsemen will tell you that schwalliger no one knew where he got the name was rolling and tumbling about the track at bennings when he was still so short in stature that he got the name of the tadpole naturally he came to know much of horses grew up with them in fact and having no wealthy father or mother to indulge him in his taste or help him use his knowledge he did the next best thing and used his special education for himself in the humble capacity of voluntary adviser to aspiring gamesters he prospered and blossomed out into good clothes of a highly ornate pattern naturally like a man in any other business he had his ups and downs and there were times when the good clothes disappeared and he was temporarily forced to return to the occupation of rubbing down horses but these periods of depression were of short duration and at the next turn of fortunes wheel he would again be on top no thuh he was wont to say with his inimitable lisp no thuh you cant keep a good man down taint no use atalkin you jeth cant it dont do me no harm to go back to rubbin now an then it jeth nachully keepth me on good termth with de hothes and indeed it did seem that his prophecies were surer and his knowledge more direct after one of these periods of enforced humility there were various things whispered about schwalliger that he was no more honest than he should be that he was not as sound as he might be but though it might be claimed and was that he would prophesy on occasion the success of three different horses to three different men no one ever accused him of being less than fair with the women who came out from the city to enjoy the races and increase their excitement by staking small sums to these schwalliger was the soul of courtesy and honour and if they lost upon his advice he was not happy until he had made it up to them again one however who sets himself to work to give a racehorse tout a character may expect to have his labour for his pains the profession of his subject is against him he may as well put aside his energy and say well perhaps he was a bad lot but the present story is not destined to put you more in love with the hero of it but the heat and enthusiasm at saratoga and the other racecourses was done and autumn and the glory of bennings had come the ingratiating schwalliger came back with the horses to his old stamping ground and to happiness the other tracks had not treated him kindly and but for the kindness of his equine friends whom he slept with and tended he might have come back to washington on the wooden steps but he was back and that was happiness for him broke well said schwalliger in answer to a trainers question i aint exactly broke misthah johnthon but i wath pretty badly bent i goth awa jutht ath thoon ath i commenth to feel mythelf crackin but im hyeah to git even he was only a rubber again but he began to get even early in the week and by saturday he was again as like to a rainbow as any of his class he did not however throw away his rubbers clothes he was used to the caprices of fortune and he did not know how soon again he should need them that he was not dressed in them and yet saved them made him capable of performing his one philanthropy had he not been gorgeously dressed he would not have inspired the confidence of the old negro who came up to him on tuesday morning disconsolate and weeping mistah he said deferentially through his tears is you a spot mr schwalligers chest protruded and his very red lips opened in a smile as he answered well i do knowth im

fu me to hide it an ef dee fin out i been gamblin ill git chuched fu it an i been a puffessor so long the old mans voice broke and schwalliger smiled the crooked smile of a man whose heart is touched whereth thith push wokin he said briefly right ovah thaih said the old negro indicating a part of the grounds not far distant all right you go on ovah thaih an wait fu me an if you thee me remembah you dont thee me i dont know you you dont know me but ill try to thee you out all right the old man went on his way a new light in his eyes at the hope schwalliger had inspired schwalliger himself made his way back to the stables his dirty horsy rubbers outfit was there he smiled intelligently as he looked at it he was smiling in a different manner when all dressed in it he came up nearer to the grand stand it was a very inane smile he looked the very image of simplicity and ignorance like a man who was anxious and ready to be duped he strolled carelessly up to where the little game with the little ball was going on and stood there looking foolishly on the three young men ostensibly there was only one were doing a rushing business they were playing very successfully on that trait of human nature which feels itself glorified and exalted when it has got something for nothing the rustics black and white and some who had not the excuse of rusticity were falling readily into the trap and losing their hardearned money every now and then a man one of their confederates of course would make a striking winning and this served as a bait for the rest of the spectators schwalliger looked on with growing interest always smiling an ignorant simple smile finally as if he could stand it no longer he ran his hand in his pocket and pulled out a roll of money money in its most beautiful and tempting form the long green notes then as if a sudden spirit of prudence had taken possession of him he put it back into his pocket shook his head and began working his way out of the crowd but the operator of the shell game had caught sight of the bills and it was like the scent of blood to the tiger his eye was on the simple negro at once and he called cheerfully come up uncle and try your luck see how i manipulate this ball easy enough to find if youre only lucky he was so flippantly shrewd that his newness to the business was insolently apparent to schwalliger who knew a thing or two himself schwalliger smiled again and shook his head oh no thuh he said i dont play dat why come and try your luck anyhow no harm in it schwalliger took out his money and looked at it again and shook his head he began again his backward movement from the crowd no he said i wouldn play erroun hyeah befo all thethe people becauthe you wouldnt pay me even ef i won why of course we would said the flippant operator everybody looks alike to us here schwalliger kept moving away ever and anon sending wistful inane glances back at his tempter the bait worked admirably the man closed up his little folding table and winking to his confederates followed the retreating negro they stayed about with the crowd while he followed on and on until schwalliger had led him into a short alley between the stables there he paused and allowed his pursuer to catch up with him thay mithtah he said what you keep on follerin me fu i do want to play wid you i aint got but foty dollahs an ef i lothe ill have to walk home why my dear fellow there aint no way for you to lose come now let me show you and he set the table down and began to manipulate the ball dexterously neednt put no money down just see if you can locate the ball a few times for fun schwalliger consented and greatly to his delight located the little ball four times out of five he was grinning now and the eye of the tempter was gleaming schwalliger took out his money how much you got he said just eightyfive dollars and i will lay it all against your forty what you got it in asked schwalliger four fives four tens and five fivedollar goldpieces and the man displayed it ostentatiously the touts eyes flashed as he saw his opponent put his money back into his waistcoat pocket well i bet you he said and planked his money down the operator took the shells and swept the pea first under one then under the other and laid the three side by side schwalliger laid his hand upon one he lifted it up and there was nothing there ha ha youve had bad luck said the operator you lose you lose well im sorry for you old fellow but we all take chances in this little game you know he was folding up his table when all of a sudden a cry arose to heaven from schwalligers lips and he grappled with the very shrewd young man while shriek on shriek of murder robber police came from his lips the police at bennings were not slow to answer a call like this and they came running up and schwalliger who among other things was something of an actor told his story trembling incoherently while the operator looked on aghast schwalliger demanded protection he had been robbed he had bet his eightyfive dollars against the operators forty and when he had accidentally picked out the right shell the operator had grabbed his money and attempted to escape he wanted his money he had eightyfive dollars he said he had fo fiveth fo tenth and five fivedollar goldpieceth an he wanted them the policeman was thorough he made his search at once it was even as schwalliger had said the money was on the gambler even as the negro had said well there was nothing but justice to be done the officers returned the eightyfive dollars to schwalliger and out of an unusual access of clemency bade the operator begone or they would run him in when he had gone schwalliger turned and winked slowly at the minions of the law and went quietly into a corner with them and there was the sound of the shuffling of silken paper later on he found the old man and returned him his ten and went back to don his jacobs coat who shall say that schwalliger was not a true philanthropist fourteen the interference of patsy ann patsy ann meriweather would have told you that her father or more properly her pappy was a widover and she would have added in her sad little voice with her mournful eyes upon you that her mother had bin daid fu nigh onto fou yeahs then you could have wept for patsy for her years were only thirteen now and since the passing away of her mother she had been the little mother for her four younger brothers and sisters as well as her fathers housekeeper but patsy ann never complained she was quite willing to be all that she had been until such time as isaac and dora cassie and little john should be old enough to care for themselves and also to lighten some of her domestic burdens she had never reckoned upon any other manner of release in fact her youthful mind was not able to contemplate the possibility of any other manner of change but the good women of patsys neighbourhood were not the ones to let her remain in this deplorable state of ignorance she was to be enlightened as to other changes that might take place in her condition and of the unspeakable horrors that would transpire with them it was upon the occasion that little john had taken it into his infant head to have the german measles just at the time that isaac was slowly recovering from the chickenpox patsy anns powers had been taxed to the utmost and mrs caroline gibson had been called in from next door to superintend the brewing of the saffron tea and for the general care of the fretful sufferer to patsy ann then in ominous tone spoke this oracle patsy ann how yo pappy doin sence matildy died matildy was the deceased wife oh he gittin long all right he was mighty broke up at de fus but he low now dat de house go on de sames ef mammy was alivin oom huh disdainfully oom huh yo mammy bin daid fou yeahs aint she yesm mighty nigh oom huh fou yeahs is a mighty long time fu a colod man to wait but wen he do wait dat long hits all de wuss wen hit do come pap bin wokin right stiddy at de brickyad said patsy in loyal defence against some vaguely implied accusation an he done put some money in de bank bad sign bad sign and mrs gibson gave her head a fearsome shake but just then the shrill voice of little john calling for attention drew her away and left patsy ann to herself and her meditations what could this mean when that lady had finished ministering to the sick child and returned patsy ann asked her mis gibson what you mean by sayin bad sign bad sign again the oracle shook her head sagely then she answered chil you do know de devment dey is in dis worl but retorted the child my pappy ain up to no devment case he got uligion an bin baptised oomm groaned sistah gibson dat don mek a bit o diffunce who is any mo mayin men den de preachahs demseves wy brothah lias scott done tempted matermony six times aready an s lookin roun fu de sebent an hes a good man too mayin said patsy breathlessly yes honey mayin an is afeared yo pappys got notions in his haid an wen a widower git gals in his haid dey ain no use apesterin wid em case dey boun to have dey way mayin said patsy to herself reflectively mayin she knew what it meant but she had never dreamed of the possibility of such a thing in connection with her father mayin and yet the idea of it did not seem so very unalluring she spoke her thoughts aloud but ef pap ud may mis gibson den id git a chanct to go to school he allus sayin he mighty sorry bout me not goin dah now dah now cried the woman casting a pitying glance at the child dats de las ting he des a feelin roun now you po ignant mothahless chil you ain nevah had no stepmothah an you don know what hit means but shed tek keer o the chillen persisted patsy sich tekin keer of em ez hit ud be shed keer fu em to dey graves nobody caint tell me nuffin bout stepmothahs case i knows em dey ain no ooman goin to tek keer o nobody elses chile lak shed tek keer o huh own and patsy felt a choking come into her throat and a tight sensation about her heart while she listened as mrs gibson regaled her with all the choice horrors that are laid at the door of stepmothers from that hour on one settled conviction took shape and possessed patsy anns mind never if she could help it would she run the risk of having a stepmother come what may let her be compelled to do what she might let the hope of school fade from her sight forever and a day but no stepmother should ever cast her baneful shadow over patsy anns home experience of life had made her wise for her years and so for the time she said nothing to her father but she began to watch him with wary eyes his goings out and his comings in and to attach new importance to trifles that had passed unnoticed before by her childish mind for instance if he greased or blacked his boots before going out of an evening her suspicions were immediately aroused and she saw dim visions of her father returning on his arm the terrible ogress whom she had come to know by the name of stepmother mrs gibsons poison had worked well and rapidly she had thoroughly inoculated the childs mind with the stepmother virus but she had not at the same time made the parent widowproof a hard thing to do at best so it came to pass that with a mysterious horror growing within her patsy ann saw her father black his boots more and more often and fare forth o nights and sunday afternoons finally her little heart could contain its sorrow no longer and one night when he was later than usual she could not sleep so she slipped out of bed turned up the light and waited for him determined to have it out then and there he came at last and was all surprise to meet the solemn round eyes of his little daughter staring at him from across the table wy lady gal he exclaimed what you doin up at his time i sat up fu you i got somepn to ax you pappy her voice quivered and he snuggled her up in his arms whats troublin my little lady gal now is de chillen bin bad she laid her head close against his big breast and the tears would come as she answered no suh de chillen bin ez good az good could be but oh pappy pappy is you got gal in yo haid an agoin to bring me a stepmothah he held her away from him almost harshly and gazed at her as he queried wy you po baby you whos bin puttin dis hyeah foolishness in yo haid then his laugh rang out as he patted her head and drew her close to him again ef yo pappy do bring a stepmothah into dis house gawd knows hell bring de right kin dey aint no right kin answered patsy you don know baby you don know go to baid an don worry he sat up a long time watching the candle sputter then he pulled off his boots and tiptoed to patsys bedside he leaned over her po little baby he said what do she know about a stepmothah and patsy saw him and heard him for she was awake then and far into the night in the eyes of the child her father stood convicted he had gal in his haid and was going to bring her a stepmother but it would never be her resolution was taken she arose early the next morning and after getting her father off to work as usual she took the children into hand first she scrubbed them assiduously burnishing their brown faces until they shone again then she tussled with their refractory locks and after that she dressed them out in all the bravery of their best clothes meanwhile her tears were falling like rain though her lips were shut tight the children off her mind she turned her attention to her own toilet which she made with scrupulous care then taking a small tintype of her mother from the bureau drawer she put it in her bosom and leading her little brood she went out of the house locking the door behind her and placing the key as was her wont under the doorstep outside she stood for a moment or two undecided and then with one long backward glance at her home she turned and went up the street at the first corner she paused again spat in her hand and struck the watery globule with her finger in the direction the most of the spittle flew she turned patsy ann was fleeing from home and a stepmother and fate had decided her direction for her even as mrs gibsons counsels had directed her course the child had no idea where she was going she knew no one to whom she might turn in her distress not even with mrs gibson would she be safe from the horror which impended she had but one impulse in her mind and that was to get beyond the reach of the terrible woman or was it a monster who was surely coming after her on and on she walked through the town with her little band trudging bravely along beside her people turned to look at the funny group and smiled goodnaturedly as they passed and one man a little more amused than the rest shouted after them where you goin sis with that orphans home but patsy anns dignity was impregnable she walked on with her head in the air the desire for safety tugging at her heart the hours passed and the gentle coolness of morning turned into the fierce heat of noon and still with frequent rests they trudged on patsy ever and anon using her divining hand unconscious that she was doubling and redoubling on her tracks when the whistles blew for twelve she got her little brood into the shade of a poplar tree and set them down to the lunch which thoughtful little mother that she was she had brought with her after that they all stretched themselves out on the grass that bordered the sidewalk for all the children were tired out and baby john was both sleepy and cross even patsy ann drowsed and finally dropped into the deep slumber of childhood they looked too peaceful and serene for passersby to bother them and so they slept and slept it was past three oclock when the little guardian awakened with a start and shook her charges into activity john wept a little at first but after a while took up his journey bravely with the rest she had just turned into a side street discouraged and bewildered when the round face of a coloured woman standing in the doorway of a whitewashed cottage caught her eye and attention once more she paused and consulted her watery oracle then turned to encounter the gaze of the roundfaced woman the oracle had spoken and she turned into the yard whaih you goin honey you sutny look lak you plumb tukahed out come in an tell me all bout yosef you po little ting dese yo little brothas an sistahs yesm said patsy ann wy chil whaih you goin i don know was the truthful answer you don know whaih you live oh i live down on douglas street said patsy ann an is runnin away

sleep in the most motherly way with the sweetness and tenderness that only a mother can give well that was patsy anns case tonight and then she laid them along like tenpins crosswise of her bed and sat for a long time thinking to maria adams about six oclock that night came a troubled and disheartened man it was no less a person than patsy anns father maria maria what shall i do somebody don stole all my chillen maria strange to say was a woman of few words don you bothah bout de chillen she said and she took him by the hand and led him to where the five lay sleeping calmly across the bed dey was runnin fom home an dey stepmothah said she dey run hyeah fom a stepmothah an foun a mothah it was a tribute and a proposal all in one when patsy ann awakened the matter was explained to her and with penitent tears she confessed her sins but she said to maria adams ef yous de kin of foks dat dey mek stepmothahs out o i ain gwine to bothah my haid no mo fifteen the homecoming of rastus smith there was a great commotion in that part of town which was known as little africa and the cause of it was not far to seek contrary to the usual thing this cause was not an excursion down the river nor a revival baptising nor an emancipation day celebration none of these was it that had aroused the denizens of little africa and kept them talking across the street from window to window from door to door through alley gates over backyard fences where they stood loudmouthed and arms akimboed among laden clothes lines no the cause of it all was that erastus smith aunt mandy smiths boy who had gone away from home several years before and who rumour said had become a great man was coming back and little africa from douglass street to cat alley was prepared to be dazzled so few of those who had been born within the mile radius which was little africa went out into the great world and came into contact with the larger humanity that when one did he became a man set apart and when besides he went into a great city and worked for a lawyer whose name was known the country over the place of his birth had all the more reason to feel proud of her son so there was much talk across the dirty little streets and aunt mandys small house found itself all of a sudden a very popular resort the old women held erastus up as an example to their sons the old men told what they might have done had they had his chance the young men cursed him and the young girls giggled and waited it was about an hour before the time of the arrival of erastus and the neighbours had thinned out one by one with a delicacy rather surprising in them in order that the old lady might be alone with her boy for the first few minutes only one remained to help put the finishing touches to the two little rooms which mrs smith called home and to the preparations for the great dinner the old woman wiped her eyes as she said to her companion hit do seem a speshul blessin lizy dat i been spaihed to see dat chile once mo in de flesh he sholy was mighty nigh to my heat an wen he went erway i thought it ud kill me but i kin see now dat hit uz all fu de bes think o rastus comin home er big man whod evah specked dat law mis smif you sholy is got reason to be mighty thankful des look how many young men dere is in dis town what aint nevah been no count to dey paents ner anybody else well its onexpected lizy an hits spected rastus allus wuz a wonnerful chil an de way he tuk to work an study kin o promised something fom de commencement an i lowed mebbe he tun out a preachah tush yo kin thank yo stahs he didnt tun out no preachah preachahs aint no bettah den anybody else dese days dey des go roun tellin dey lies an eatin de whiders an orphins out o house an home well mebbe hits bes he didn tun out dat way but fom de way he used to stan on de chaih an zort wen he was a little boy i thought hit was des what he ud tun out o cose being in a law office is des as pervidin but somehow hit do seem mo worly didnt i tell you de preachahs is ez worldly ez anybody else yes yes dats right but den rastus he had de eddication fo he had gone thoo de third readah just then the gate creaked and a little brownfaced girl with large mild eyes pushed open the door and came shyly in hyeahs some flowahs mis smif she said i thought mebbe you might like to decorate rastuss room and she wiped the confusion from her face with her apron la chil thankee dese is mighty putty posies these were the laurels which sally martin had brought to lay at the feet of her homecoming hero no one in cat alley but that queer quiet little girl would have thought of decorating anybodys room with flowers but she had peculiar notions in the old days when they were children and before erastus had gone away to become great they had gone up and down together along the byways of their locality and had loved as children love later when erastus began keeping company it was upon sally that he bestowed his affections no one not even her mother knew how she had waited for him all these years that he had been gone few in reality but so long and so many to her and now he was coming home she scorched something in the ironing that day because tears of joy were blinding her eyes her thoughts were busy with the meeting that was to be she had a brand new dress for the occasion a lawn with dark blue dots and a blue sash and there was a new hat wonderful with the flowers of summer and for both of them she had spent her hardearned savings because she wished to be radiant in the eyes of the man who loved her of course erastus had not written her but he must have been busy and writing was hard work she knew that herself and realised it all the more as she penned the loving little scrawls which at first she used to send him now they would not have to do any writing any more they could say what they wanted to each other he was coming home at last and she had waited long they paint angels with shining faces and halos but for real radiance one should have looked into the dark eyes of sally as she sped home after her contribution to her lovers reception when the last one of the neighbours had gone aunt mandy sat down to rest herself and to await the great event she had not sat there long before the gate creaked she arose and hastened to the window a young man was coming down the path was that rastus could that be her rastus that gorgeous creature with the shiny shoes and the nobby suit and the carelesslyswung cane but he was knocking at her door and she opened it and took him into her arms why howdy honey howdy hit do beat all to see you agin a great big grownup man youre lookin des lak one o de big folks up in town erastus submitted to her endearments with a somewhat condescending grace as who should say well poor old fool let her go on this time she doesnt know any better he smiled superiorly when the old woman wept glad tears as mothers have a way of doing over returned sons however great fools these sons may be she set him down to the dinner which she had prepared for him and with loving patience drew from his pompous and reluctant lips some of the story of his doings and some little word about the places he had seen oh yes he said crossing his legs as soon as mr carrington saw that i was pretty bright he took me right up and gave me a good job and i have been working for him right straight along for seven years now of course it dont do to let white folks know all youre thinking but i have kept my ears and my eyes right open and i guess i know just about as much about law as he does himself when i save up a little more im going to put on the finishing touches and hang out my shingle dont you nevah think no mo bout bein a preachah rastus his mother asked haw haw preachah well i guess not no preaching in mine theres nothing in it in law you always have a chance to get into politics and be the president of your ward club or something like that and from that on its an easy matter to go on up you can trust me to know the wires and so the tenor of his boastful talk ran on his mother a little bit awed and not altogether satisfied with the new rastus that had returned to her he did not stay in long that evening although his mother told him some of the neighbours were going to drop in he said he wanted to go about and see something of the town he paused just long enough to glance at the flowers in his room and to his mothers remark sally matin brung dem in he returned answer who on earth is sally martin why rastus exclaimed his mother does yo tend lak yo dont member little sally matin yo used to go wid almos fom de time you was babies wy im sprised at you she has slipped my mind said the young man for a long while the neighbours who had come and aunt mandy sat up to wait for erastus but he did not come in until the last one was gone in fact he did not get in until nearly four oclock in the morning looking a little weak but at least in the best of spirits and he vouchsafed to his waiting mother the remark that the little old town wasnt so bad after all aunt mandy preferred the request that she had had in mind for some time that he would go to church the next day and he consented because his trunk had come it was a glorious sunday morning and the old lady was very proud in her stiff gingham dress as she saw her son come into the room arrayed in his long coat shiny hat and shinier shoes well if it was true that he was changed he was still her rastus and a great comfort to her there was no vanity about the old woman but she paused before the glass a longer time than usual settling her bonnet strings for she must look right she told herself to walk to church with that elegant son of hers when he was all ready with cane in hand and she was pausing with the key in the door he said just walk on mother ill catch you in a minute or two she went on and left him he did not catch her that morning on her way to church and it was a sore disappointment but it was somewhat compensated for when she saw him stalking into the chapel in all his glory and every head in the house turned to behold him there was one other woman in little africa that morning who stopped for a longer time than usual before her lookingglass and who had never found her bonnet strings quite so refractory before in spite of the vexation of flowers that wouldnt settle and ribbons that wouldnt tie a very glad face looked back at sally martin from her little mirror she was going to see rastus rastus of the old days in which they used to walk hand in hand he had told her when he went away that some day he would come back and marry her her heart fluttered hotly under her dotted lawn and it took another application of the chamois to take the perspiration from her face people had laughed at her but that morning she would be vindicated he would walk home with her before the whole church already she saw him bowing before her hat in hand and heard the set phrase may i have the pleasure of your company home and she saw herself sailing away upon his arm she was very happy as she sat in church that morning as happy as mrs smith herself and as proud when she saw the object of her affections swinging up the aisle to the collection table and from the ring she knew that it could not be less than a half dollar that he put in there was a special note of praise in her voice as she joined in singing the doxology that morning and her heart kept quivering and fluttering like a frightened bird as the people gathered in groups chattering and shaking hands and he drew nearer to her now they were almost together in a moment their eyes would meet her breath came quickly he had looked at her surely he must have seen her his mother was just behind him and he did not speak maybe she had changed maybe he had forgotten her an unaccustomed boldness took possession of her and she determined that she would not be overlooked she pressed forward she saw his mother take his arm and heard her whisper deres sally matin this time and she knew that he looked at her he bowed as if to a stranger and was past her the next minute when she saw him again he was swinging out of the door between two admiring lines of churchgoers who separated on the pavement there was a brazen yellow girl on his arm she felt weak and sick as she hid behind the crowd as well as she could and for that morning she thanked god that she was small aunt mandy trudged home alone and when the street was cleared and the sexton was about to lock up the girl slipped out of the church and down to her own little house in the friendly shelter of her room she took off her gay attire and laid it away and then sat down at the window and looked dully out for her the light of day had gone out sixteen the boy and the bayonet it was june and nearing the closing time of school the air was full of the sound of bustle and preparation for the final exercises field day and drills drills especially for nothing so gladdens the heart of the washington mother be she black or white as seeing her boy in the blue cadets uniform marching proudly to the huzzas of an admiring crowd then she forgets the many nights when he has come in tired out and dusty from his practice drill and feels only the pride and elation of the result although tom did all he could outside of study hours there were many days of hard work for hannah davis when her son went into the high school but she took it upon herself gladly since it gave bud the chance to learn that she wanted him to have when however he entered the cadet corps it seemed to her as if the first steps toward the fulfilment of all her hopes had been made it was a hard pull to her getting the uniform but bud himself helped manfully and when his mother saw him rigged out in all his regimentals she felt that she had not toiled in vain and in fact it was worth all the trouble and expense just to see the joy and pride of little sister who adored bud as the time for the competitive drill drew near there was an air of suppressed excitement about the little house on d street where the three lived all day long little sister who was never very well and did not go to school sat and looked out of the window on the uninteresting prospect of a dusty thoroughfare lined on either side with dull red brick houses all of the same ugly pattern interspersed with older uglier and viler frame shanties in the evening hannah hurried home to get supper against the time when bud should return hungry and tired from his drilling and the chore work which followed hard upon its heels things were all cheerful however for as they applied themselves to the supper the boy with glowing face would tell just how his company a was getting on and what they were going to do to companies b and c it was not boasting so much as the expression of a confidence founded upon the hard work he was doing and hannah and the little sister shared that with him the child often listening to her brother would clap her hands or cry oh bud youre just splendid an i know youll beat em if hard workll beat em weve got em beat bud would reply and hannah to add an admonitory check to her own confidence would break in with now dont you be too sho son dey aint been no man so good dat dey wasnt somebody bettah but all the while her face and manner were disputing what her words expressed the great day came and it was a wonderful crowd of people that packed the great baseball grounds to overflowing it seemed that all of washingtons coloured population was out when there were really only about onetenth of them there it was an enthusiastic bannerwaving shouting hallooing crowd its component parts were strictly and frankly partisan and so separated themselves into sections differentiated by the colours of the flags they carried and the ribbons they wore side yelled defiance at side and party bantered party here the blue and white of company a flaunted audaciously on the breeze beside the very seats over which the crimson and gray of b were flying and these in their turn nodded defiance over the imaginary barrier between themselves and cs black and yellow the band was thundering out sousas high school cadets march the school officials the judges and reporters and some with less purpose were bustling about discussing and conferring altogether doing nothing much with beautiful unanimity all was noise hurry gaiety and turbulence in the midst of it all with blue and white rosettes pinned on their breasts sat two spectators tense and silent while the breakers of movement and sound struck and broke around them it meant too much to hannah and little sister for them to laugh and shout bud was with company a and so the whole programme was more like a religious ceremonial to them the blare of the brass to them might have been the trumpet call to battle in old judea and the farthrown tones of the megaphone the voice of a prophet proclaiming from the hilltop hannahs face glowed with expectation and little sister sat very still and held her mothers hand save when amid a burst of cheers company a swept into the parade ground at a quick step then she sprang up crying shrilly theres bud theres bud i see him and then settled back into her seat overcome with embarrassment the mothers eyes danced as soon as the sisters had singled out their dear one from the midst of the bluecoated boys and it was an effort for her to keep from following her little daughters example even to echoing her words company a came swinging down the field toward the judges in a manner that called for more enthusiastic huzzas that carried even the freshman of other commands off their feet they were indeed a set of finelooking young fellows brisk straight and soldierly in bearing their captain was proud of them and his very step showed it he was like a skilled operator pressing the key of some great mechanism and at his command they moved like clockwork seen from the side it was as if they were all bound together by inflexible iron bars and as the end man moved all must move with him the crowd was full of exclamations of praise and admiration but a tense quiet enveloped them as company a came from columns of four into line for volley firing this was a real test it meant not only grace and precision of movement singleness of attention and steadiness but quickness tempered by selfcontrol at the command the volley rang forth like a single shot this was again the signal for wild cheering and the blue and white streamers kissed the sunlight with swift impulsive kisses hannah and little sister drew closer together and pressed hands the a adherents however were considerably cooled when the next volley came out badly scattering with one shot entirely apart and before the rest buds mother did not entirely understand the sudden quieting of the adherents they felt vaguely that all was not as it should be and the chill of fear laid hold upon their hearts what if buds company it was always buds company to them what if his company should lose but of course that couldnt be bud himself had said that they would win suppose though they didnt and with these thoughts they were miserable until the cheering again told them that the company had redeemed itself someone behind hannah said they are doing splendidly theyll win theyll win yet in spite of the second volley company a in columns of fours had executed the right oblique in double time and halted amid cheers then formed left halt into line without halting the next movement was one looked forward to with much anxiety on account of its difficulty the order was marching by fours to fix or unfix bayonets they were going at a quick step but the boys hands were steady hope was bright in their hearts they were doing it rapidly and freely when suddenly from the ranks there was the bright gleam of steel lower down than it should have been a gasp broke from the breasts of company as friends the blue and white drooped disconsolately while a few heartless ones who wore other colours attempted to hiss someone had dropped his bayonet but with muscles unquivering without a turned head the company moved on as if nothing had happened while one of the judges an army officer stepped into the wake of the boys and picked up the fallen steel no two eyes had seen half so quickly as hannah and little sisters who the blunderer was in the whole drill there had been but one figure for them and that was bud bud and it was he who had dropped his bayonet anxious nervous with the desire to please them perhaps with a shade too much of thought of them looking on with their hearts in their eyes he had fumbled and lost all that he was striving for his head went round and round and all seemed black before him he executed the movements in a dazed way the applause generous and sympathetic as his company left the parade ground came to him from afar off and like a wounded animal he crept away from his comrades not because their reproaches stung him for he did not hear them but because he wanted to think what his mother and little sister would say but his misery was as nothing to that of the two who sat up there amid the ranks of the blue and white holding each others hands with a despairing grip to bud all of the rest of the contest was a horrid nightmare he hardly knew when the three companies were marched back to receive the judges decision the applause that greeted company b when the blue ribbons were pinned on the members coats meant nothing to his ears he had disgraced himself and his company what would his mother and his little sister say to hannah and little sister as to bud all of the remainder of the drill was a misery the one interest they had had in it failed and not even the dropping of his gun by one of company e when on the march halting in line could raise their spirits the little girl tried to be brave but when it was all over she was glad to hurry out before the crowd got started and to hasten away home once there and her tears flowed freely she hid her face in her mothers dress and sobbed as if her heart would break dont cry baby dont cry lammie dis aint da las time da wah goin to be a drill budll have a chance anotha time and den hell show em somethin bless you i spec hell be a captain but this consolation of philosophy was nothing to little sister it was so terrible to her this failure of buds she couldnt blame him she couldnt blame anyone else and she had not yet learned to lay all such unfathomed catastrophes at the door of fate what to her was the thought of another day what did it matter to her whether he was a captain or a private she didnt even know the meaning of the words but little sister from the time she knew bud was a private knew that that was much better than being captain or any of those other things with a long name so that settled it her mother finally set about getting the supper while little sister drooped disconsolately in her own little splintbottomed chair she sat there weeping silently until she heard the sound of buds step then she sprang up and ran away to hide she didnt dare to face him with tears in her eyes bud came in without a word and sat down in the dark front room dat you bud asked his mother yassum bettah come now suppers puty nigh ready i don want no supper you bettah come on bud i reckon you mighty tired he did not reply but just then a pair of thin arms were put around his neck and a soft cheek was placed close to his own come on buddie whispered little sister mammy an me know you didnt mean to do it an we don keer bud threw his arms around his little sister and held her tightly its only you an ma i care about he said though i am sorry i spoiled the companys drill they say b would have won anyway on account of our bad firing but i did want you and ma to be proud we is proud she whispered wes mos prouder dan if youd won and pretty soon she led him by the hand out to supper hannah did all she could to cheer the boy and to encourage him to hope for next year but he had little to say in reply and went to bed early in the morning though it neared school time bud lingered around and seemed in no disposition to get ready to go bettah git ready fer school said hannah cheerily to him i dont believe i want to go any more bud replied not go any more why aint you shamed to talk that way o cose you a goin to school im ashamed to show my face to the boys what you say about de boys de boys aint agoin to give you no edgication when you need it oh i dont want to go ma you dont know how i feel im kinder sorry i let you go into dat company said hannah musingly cause it was de teachin i wanted you to git not de prancin and steppin but i did tink it would make mo of a man of you an it aint yo pappy was a po man had wokin an he wasnt hightoned neither but from the time i first see him to the day of his death i nevah seen him back down because he was afeared of anything and hannah turned to her work little sister went up to bud and slipped her hand in his you aint agoin to back down is you buddie she said no said bud stoutly as he braced his shoulders im agoin but no persuasion could make him wear his uniform the boys were a little cold to him and some were brutal but most of them recognised the fact that what had happened to tom harris might have happened to any one of them besides since the percentage had been shown it was found that b had outpointed them in many ways and so their loss was not due to the one grave error buds heart sank when he dropped into his seat in the assembly hall to find seated on the platform one of the bluecoated officers who had acted as judge the day before after the opening exercises were over he was called upon to address the school he spoke readily and pleasantly laying especial stress upon the value of discipline toward the end of his address he said i suppose company a is heaping accusations upon the head of the young man who dropped his bayonet yesterday tom could have died it was most regrettable the officer continued but to me the most significant thing at the drill was the conduct of that cadet afterward i saw the whole proceeding i saw that he did not pause for an instant that he did not even turn his head and it appeared to me as one of the finest bits of selfcontrol i had ever seen in any youth had he forgotten himself for a moment and stopped however quickly to secure the weapon the next line would have been interfered with and your whole movement thrown into confusion there were a half hundred eyes glancing furtively at bud and the light began to dawn in his face this boy has shown what discipline means and i for one want to shake hands with him if he is here when he had concluded the principal called bud forward and the boys even his detractors cheered as the officer took his hand why are you not in uniform sir he asked i was ashamed to wear it after yesterday was the reply dont be ashamed to wear your uniform the officer said to him and bud could have fallen on his knees and thanked him there were no more jeers from his comrades now and when he related it all at home that evening there were two more happy hearts in that south washington cottage i told you we was more prouder dan if youd won said little sister an what did i tell you bout backin out asked his mother bud was too happy and too busy to answer he was brushing his uniform
