chapter one john meets percy john t unger came from a wellknown family in hades a small town on the mississippi river he was sixteen and his parents wanted him to have a good new england education they decided to send him to st midas school near boston hades was too small for their clever son mrs unger packed her sons trunks and mr unger gave him a lot of money remember youre always welcome back here he said i know said john dont forget who you are and where you come from said his father proudly i you are an unger from hades john was crying as he walked away as he was leaving the city he looked back at hades for the last time st midas school is half an hour from boston and it was the most expensive and most exclusive boys preparatory school in the world johns first two years went well the fathers of all the boys were very rich and john spent his summers visiting his classmates in their fashionable holiday homes in the middle of his second year at school a quiet handsome boy named percy washington joined johns class the new student was pleasant and very well dressed it was obvious that he came from a very rich family percy and john immediately became friends in fact john was percys only friend as percy did not want to make friends with the other boys but even with john percy was reserved and he did not talk about his home or family so when john was invited to spend the summer at percys home in the west john was surprised but he accepted happily percy started talking about his family when they were on the train my father said percy is the richest man in the world oh said john politely he could think of no other answer the richest repeated percy i read that there was a man in america who earned five million dollars a year and four other men who earned more than three million dollars a year oh theyre nothing said percy my father could buy everything they have goodness said john he must be very rich im glad i like very rich people i visited the schnlitzermurphys last easter vivian schnlitzermurphy had jewels as big as chickens eggs i love jewels said percy enthusiastically of course i dont want anyone at school to know about it but i have quite a big collection i collect them instead of stamps and diamonds continued john the schnlitzermurphys had diamonds as big as walnuts oh thats nothing percy moved closer to john and whispered thats nothing at all my father has a diamond bigger than the ritzcarlton hotel the sunset in montana was beautiful as the train stopped in a small village called fish a horsedrawn carriage came and drove them away after half an hour the sky became dark and a magnificent huge i car appeared on the road john had never seen such a car get in said percy to his friend im sorry we had to bring you here in a carriage but we cant let the people on the train and from the village see this car what a car said john who was amazed this thing laughed percy its just an old car they drove in the darkness towards the opening between two mountains percy looked at the clock in the car and said well be there in an hour and a half youve never seen anything like it before john was prepared to be surprised were driving uphill now said percy an ordinary car could not drive up this road there was a pale moon in the distance the car stopped suddenly and some men appeared out of the dark they started working and four huge metal cables i came down from above they were tied to the wheels and the car was slowly lifted from the ground it went higher and higher and then suddenly they were on the ground again the worst is over said percy looking out of the window now its only five miles from here and its our road it belongs to us this is where the united states ends are we in canada no were not were in montana in the middle of the rocky mountains you are on the only five square miles of land in america that arent on any map why did they forget asked john no said percy they tried to put it on the map three times the first time my grandfather corrupted an entire government department and the second time he changed the maps of the united states the last time was more difficult my father created a very strong magnetic field and the mapmakers compasses did not work they thought our place was ten miles further up the valley theres only one thing my father is afraid of percy said its the only thing that could find us whats that asked john airplanes percy whispered we have half a dozen antiaircraft guns so no one has found us yet some pilots have died and some have become prisoners father and i dont mind that but my mother and sisters worry about it the stars in montana were very bright that night as they drove on suddenly john saw a magnificent castle of shining marble near a big lake john was amazed by the towers and the thousand yellow windows with their golden light it looked like a fairyland then he heard the sound of violins playing beautiful music he had never heard anything like it before the car stopped in front of high marble steps at the top of the steps two huge doors opened silently and a beautiful lady with black hair was there to meet them mother said percy this is my friend john unger from hades chapter two an amazing discovery afterwards john remembered that first night as a beautiful dream a dream of music of beautiful things of lights and faces there was a man with white hair who drank from a gold cup there was a girl with a face like a flower with precious blue jewels in her hair there were rooms with walls of gold and there were diamonds of all shapes and sizes everywhere in the corners of the splendid rooms there were crystal lamps and on the floors there were fur rugs of different types and colors then they went to dinner the plates were made of diamonds and there was music everywhere john was overcome by i the beauty and wealth that surrounded him and he fell asleep he woke up several hours later he was in a large room and percy was standing over him you fell asleep at dinner percy said i almost did too it was so good to be comfortable again after a year at school some servants undressed you and washed you while you were sleeping is this a bed or a cloud its so comfortable said john percy before you go i want to apologize he added why well i didnt really believe you when you said you had a diamond as big as the ritzcarlton hotel percy smiled i thought you didnt believe me its that mountain you know what mountain the mountain the castle is on its not a very big mountain because except for some earth on top its solid diamond one big diamond arent you listening but john t unger was asleep the next morning he woke up and discovered that the room was filled with sunlight a servant in a white uniform stood beside his bed good evening said john trying to remember where he was good morning sir are you ready for your bath sir dont get up ill put you in there thank you sir johns pajamas were taken off he expected to be lifted like a child but this did not happen instead he felt the bed move slowly on its side then he began to roll down gently into bath water which was the same temperature as his body he was surrounded by a blue aquarium and he could see fish swimming sunlight came from above through seagreen glass would you like hot perfumed water this morning sir and perhaps cold water to finish yes agreed john as you please shall i turn on the movingpicture machine sir asked the servant no thanks answered john politely he was enjoying the bath so much that he didnt want any distraction after a moment he heard music coming from outside when the bath was over he was rubbed with oil alcohol and perfume then a servant shaved his face mr percy is waiting in your sitting room said the servant my name is gygsum mr unger sir i will serve you every morning john walked out into the sunshine of his sitting room where he found breakfast waiting for him percy was also there beautifully dressed sitting in an armchair percy told john the following story of the washington family at breakfast at the end of the american civil war the father of the present mr washington fitznorman washington was a twentyfive year old colonel i with about a thousand dollars in gold fitznorman was a direct descendant of george washington one day he decided to go west as many people were doing at that time and took twentyfour of his best servants with him after less than a month in montana things were not going well and this is when he made a great discovery one day he got lost in the hills and after a day without food he was very hungry he saw a squirrel but because he did not have a gun he had to run after it he noticed that the squirrel had something shiny in its mouth just before it disappeared into a hole the squirrel dropped a large perfect diamond at last he managed to find his camp and the next morning he took his servants with him to dig for more diamonds since none of his servants knew what a diamond was or how valuable it was he did not inform them he was amazed to discover that the mountain was a single huge diamond he filled four bags full of diamonds and went back to town there he sold six small stones when he tried to sell a bigger stone the storekeeper fainted and fitznorman was arrested for disturbing the peace he escaped from prison and caught the train for new york where he sold a few mediumsized diamonds he got about two hundred thousand dollars in gold but he did not want to sell anymore in fact he left new york just in time because people were talking about the discovery of a diamond mine and everyone wanted to find diamonds young fitznorman returned to montana chapter three kismine in two weeks fitznorman calculated that the diamond mountain was about equal in quantity to all the diamonds in the world it was impossible to know its exact value no one in the world had enough gold to buy it and what could anyone do with such a huge diamond it was an amazing situation in one sense he was the richest man that ever lived and yet what was he worth the discovery of such a diamond would create a disaster on the world market the only thing he could do was to sell his discovery secretly fitznorman started traveling to different parts of the world with one hundred thousand dollars and two trunks filled with diamonds of all sizes he sailed to st petersburg in russia where he stayed in a small hotel he met with the court jeweler and announced that he had a diamond for the czar he remained in st petersburg for two weeks moving from one hotel to another because his life was in danger fitznorman then moved on to leave for india before he left russia he promised the czar to return the next year with bigger and better diamonds he then visited the capitals of twentytwo countries and talked with five emperors eleven kings three princes and a sultan at that time he calculated his wealth to be one billion dollars from until his death in the history of fitznorman washington was a long story of immense wealth he married a lady from virginia had a son and murdered his brother because he often got drunk and nearly told people their secret there were a few other murders during these happy years of progress before his death he converted his money into gold and deposited it in banks all over the world his son braddock transformed the gold into a very rare element radium so that a billion dollars in gold could fit in a little box three years after fitznormans death his son decided that the business had gone far enough his wealth was beyond calculation and could support all the washingtons for generations so he closed the diamond mine but he knew that he had to protect his secret this was the family john t unger was staying with this was the story he heard in his silverwalled sitting room that morning after breakfast john walked out of the great marble entrance and looked at the beautiful valley with its lakes gardens and trees he went down the marble steps and walked along some blue and white stones that seemed to go nowhere he turned a corner and saw a girl coming towards him she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen she was wearing a little white dress that came to just below her knees her pink feet were bare she was younger than john not more than sixteen hello she said softly im kismine john could not believe his eyes you didnt meet me last night because i wasnt feeling well you met my sister jasmine nice to meet you john said i hope youre feeling better she suggested that they sit down together john was critical about women a single defect a big ankle a loud voice a cold look was enough to make him lose interest for the first time in his life he was sitting next to a girl who seemed to be perfect are you from the east asked kismine with interest no answered john im from hades im going to school in the east this fall she said do you think ill like it im going to new york to miss bulges its very strict but father said i must not worry your father wants you to be proud observed john we are proud she answered her eyes shining with pride none of us has ever been punished father said we never should be mother was well a little surprised i continued kismine when she heard that you were from where you are from you know but then shes spanish and oldfashioned do you spend much time out here asked john trying to hide the fact that he was a bit hurt by this comment percy and jasmine and i are here every summer she paused and then said you know im a very innocent girl i never smoke or drink or read anything except poetry i know hardly any mathematics or chemistry and i dress very simply i believe that girls should enjoy their youth in a good healthy way i do too said john enthusiastically i like you she whispered are you going to spend all your time with percy while youre here or will you be nice to me no boy has ever been in love with me in all my life ive never even been allowed to see boys alone except percy i came out here hoping to meet you where the family wouldnt be around john bowed as he was taught at dancing school in hades we should go now said kismine sweetly i have to be with mother at eleven you havent asked me to kiss you once i thought boys always did that nowadays well john answered proudly some of them do but not me girls dont do that sort of thing in hades they walked back to the house side by side chapter four the hole john stood looking at mr braddock washington in the full sunlight braddock was about forty he had a proud face intelligent eyes and a strong body he carried a walking stick with a single precious stone he and percy were showing john their property live here he said pointing at some marble houses they are the descendants of the ones my father brought with him from virginia now there are two hundred and fifty of them they have lived away from the world for so long that they have developed another language this is the golf course he continued as they walked over the beautiful green grass he smiled pleasantly at john are there many men in the cage father asked percy suddenly one less than there should be braddock washington replied angrily weve had some difficulties mother told me said percy that italian teacher a terrible mistake said braddock washington but of course theres a good chance that we got him perhaps he fell over a cliff but even if he is free now who will believe his story however i have two dozen men looking for him in different towns around here any luck asked percy some fourteen of them reported that they each killed a man who looked like him but they were probably after the reward he stopped talking they came to a large hole in the ground covered by strong iron bars braddock washington pointed to the hole with his walking stick john stopped at the edge and looked down he immediately heard shouting from below come on down to hell hello boy hows the air up there hey throw us a rope do you have an old sandwich for us it was too dark to see clearly into the hole below but john could tell from their voices and comments that they were middleclass americans then mr washington touched a button in the grass with his walking stick and suddenly there was light these are some men who had the misfortune of discovering the mountain braddock washington said below them there appeared a large hole in the earth that looked like the inside of a bowl the sides were steep and made of glass at the bottom there were about twenty men in uniforms of airplane pilots they all seemed to be healthy braddock washington went to the edge of the hole and asked in a friendly voice well how are you boys angry voices came from the huge hole a tall man held up his hand and said let me ask you a few questions you think youre a fair man how could a man of my position be fair towards you braddock washington asked all right the tall man cried weve talked about this before youre not fair but youre human put yourself in our place for once why dont you trust us to keep your secret are you serious i trusted one man to teach my daughter italian and last week he escaped the prisoners suddenly cheered with happiness braddock washington was silent you see he continued i have nothing against you i like to see you enjoying yourselves thats why i didnt tell you the whole story at once the man what was his name was shot by some of my men in fourteen different places the pilots were suddenly silent mr washington took his walking stick and pushed the button in the grass the light below went out and the hole was dark again mr washington followed by the two boys walked away on his green golf course july on the diamond mountain was a month of cool nights and warm sunny days john and kismine were in love late one afternoon when the music room was not in use they spent an hour there together he held her hand and she gave him such a look that he whispered her name aloud she moved towards him did you say kismine she asked softly or she wanted to be sure neither one of them had ever kissed anyone before but during the next hour it seemed to make little difference they decided to get married as soon as possible chapter five what happened to the guests every day mr washington and the two boys went hunting or fishing played golf or swam in the cool mountain lake john found that mr washington was completely uninterested in any ideas or opinions except his own mrs washington was always reserved and shy she was quite indifferent to her two daughters and was only interested in percy with whom she had long conversations in spanish at dinner jasmine the older daughter looked like kismine but was not so pretty her favorite books were about girls from poor families percy and kismine seemed to have the arrogant attitude of their father they were both selfish john was fascinated by the castle and one day he asked percy who built this wonderful castle oh he answered im embarrassed to tell you but it was a man who worked in the film industry he was the only person we found who could work with an unlimited amount of money although he couldnt read or write towards the end of august john was sorry that he had to return to school he and kismine decided to run away and get married the following june it would be nicer to get married here kismine said but i could never get fathers permission to marry you the best thing is to run away its terrible for rich people to get married in america because they have to inform the newspapers i know said john one afternoon late in august one of kismines comments changed the entire situation and terrified john they were in their favorite place and between kisses john said sadly sometimes i think well never marry youre too wealthy too magnificent youre not like other girls because youre too rich i should marry the daughter of a rich businessman and be happy with her halfmillion dollars i knew the daughter of a rich businessman once said kismine she was a friend of my sister who visited us oh then youve had other guests john asked oh yes she said quickly weve had a few but wasnt your father afraid they would tell others about this place well yes she answered lets talk about something more pleasant but now john was curious something more pleasant he said whats unpleasant about this werent they nice girls john was very surprised when kismine started to cry yes that thats the trouble i liked some of them very much and jasmine did too but she continued inviting them anyway i couldnt understand it john suddenly went cold do you mean what happened to them asked john father took no chances and jasmine kept inviting them and they had such a good time john was horrified by what he heard and sat there open mouthed now ive told you and i shouldnt have she said drying her dark blue eyes do you mean that your father murdered them before they left she nodded in august usually or early in september its only natural for us to get all the pleasure out of them first how absolutely terrible how why i must be going mad did you really say that i did kismine said quietly we cant imprison them like the pilots because we would be able to see them everyday that would make us feel very bad to make it easier for jasmine and me father always did it sooner than we expected that way we didnt have to say goodbye so you murdered them cried john it was done very nicely they were drugged while they were sleeping and their families were always told that they had died of a disease but i cant understand why you continued inviting them i didnt cried kismine i have never invited anyone they were jasmines guests and they always had a very good time jasmine gave them the nicest presents especially towards the end i will probably have visitors too then i wont feel so bad about it we cant let such a thing as death stand in the way i of enjoying our life think of how lonely it would be here if no one ever came to visit why father and mother have lost some of their best friends just as we have and so cried john and so you let me love you and pretended to return my love and you talked about marriage knowing that i would never leave this place alive no she protested not anymore i did at first you were here and i thought your last days should be pleasant for both of us but then i fell in love with you and im honestly sorry youre going to be killed but if you are killed you cant ever kiss another girl oh really is that what you think cried john fiercely well yes i have always heard that a girl can have more fun with a man she knows she can never marry oh why did i tell you ive probably ruined your good time now and we were really enjoying ourselves i knew it would make things quite sad for you oh you did said john very angrily ive heard enough of this if you think its fun to fall in love with a boy who isnt much better than a corpse then stay away from me youre not a corpse she protested in horror youre not a corpse you cant say i kissed a corpse i didnt say that yes you did you said i kissed a corpse i didnt their voices were loud but when they heard footsteps they became silent a moment later braddock washington was looking at them through the rose bushes who kissed a corpse he asked nobody answered kismine quickly we were just joking what are you two doing here he asked kismine you should read or play golf with your sister go read go play golf i dont want to find you here when i return then he bowed to john and left see said kismine angrily when her father left see what youve done we can never meet again he wont let me meet you he will poison you if he thinks were in love were not in love anymore cried john fiercely he doesnt have to worry about that and dont think im going to stay here any longer in six hours ill be over those mountains no matter what i have to do they were both standing and kismine came close and put her arm through his im going too you must be mad of course im going she interrupted his love for her suddenly returned she was his she would go with him and share the dangers he put his arms around her and kissed her after all she saved him she loved him they walked back slowly towards the castle and discussed how they would escape they decided that since braddock washington had seen them together they should leave the next night chapter six the bribe long after midnight john woke up suddenly because he heard a loud noise outside his room then he heard some footsteps and a whisper he knew his life was in danger and he was afraid with a sudden movement he pressed the button near his bed and the next moment he was sitting in the bath in the next room he jumped out wet and cold and ran for the door he stood near the big staircase and everything was silent and beautiful then two things happened at once the door of his own sitting room opened and three slaves entered the hall then braddock washington appeared in the elevator wearing a fur coat and riding boots he realized at once that these men wanted to kill him they looked at braddock washington who shouted get in here all three of you quick the three slaves ran into the elevator something very serious was happening something much more serious than his murder but what could it be were the pilots trying to escape or had the people of fish discovered the valley john did not know he heard the elevator go up and down again percy was probably going to help his father he thought this was his opportunity to join kismine and plan their immediate escape he waited until the elevator was silent for several minutes and then he returned to his room and dressed quickly the door of kismines sitting room was open and the lamps were on kismine was standing near the window listening to something as john entered she turned towards him oh its you she whispered walking towards him did you hear them i heard your fathers slaves in my no she interrupted did you hear the airplanes airplanes perhaps that was the sound that woke me there are at least a dozen i saw one a few moments ago against the moon one of the guards fired his gun and my father woke up were going to start shooting at them immediately are they here on purpose yes its that italian who escaped but lets go up to the roof garden and watch from there she took his hand and they went up to the roof garden in the elevator where john kissed her from the roof garden they could see a dozen bombers flying in a circle and soon the antiaircraft guns were attacking them kismine clapped her hands happily but a moment later the bombers began dropping their bombs and the valley was in flames the airplanes began attacking the antiaircraft guns and soon one of them was destroyed after a while only two guns were left they could not protect the castle much longer come on john cried pulling kismines arm we have to go now dont you realize that those airplanes will attack you if they see you kismine left the roof garden unwillingly well have to wake jasmine she said as they hurried towards the elevator then she added with a sort of childish delight well be poor wont we like people in books i wont have any parents and ill be completely free free and poor what fun she stopped and gave john a happy kiss its impossible to be both free and poor said john seriously i would choose to be free and not poor you should bring your jewelry with you ten minutes later the two girls met john in the dark corridor they went through the magnificent halls for the last time and stood for a moment out on the terrace and watched the battle kismine led john and jasmine along a path to a hiding place from there they could watch the battle in the valley and escape when necessary it was three oclock in the morning when they reached their hiding place jasmine sat against a large tree and fell asleep immediately john and kismine sat together and watched the battle shortly after four oclock the last gun was destroyed in a cloud of red smoke the airplanes were flying closer to the ground soon they would land and that would be the end of the washingtons as the shooting stopped the valley became quiet the castle stood dark and silent it was beautiful without light as it had been beautiful in the sun john saw that kismine like her sister was sleeping some time later john heard footsteps along the path he waited in silence for them to pass then he continued walking up the mountain he felt that someone was there ahead of him he slowly lifted his head above the edge to see who it was braddock washington was standing on top of the mountain against the sky which was gray just before dawn john watched braddock washington who was lost in his thoughts he was as still as a statue then suddenly he told the two slaves who were at his feet to lift a huge object that was between them the first rays of the morning sun hit the magnificent huge diamond as the slaves slowly lifted it then braddock washington lifted his head and began to speak with immense pride you out there he cried youthere he paused for a moment his hands were raised what was he doing was he praying john thought oh you up there the voice became strong and confident he was not praying you there john listened breathlessly but he could only hear a few words here and there then he suddenly realized that braddock washington was offering a bribe to god the diamond in the hands of his slaves was a sample a promise of more to follow braddock washington would give to god the greatest and most perfect diamond in the world the diamond was so immense it could become an enormous building it could be made into a great church many men would work on it for years and it would be decorated with gold and other precious metals in the middle of the church there would be an altar of iridescent radium which would burn out the eyes of anyone who looked at it while praying in return braddock washington asked for only a simple thing a thing that would be very easy for god he asked that things return to the way they were yesterday at this time and that they remain so it was very simple let the heavens open and take these men and airplanes let him and his slaves live as they did before braddock washington spoke to god but was his bribe big enough for god he thought god had his price it was said that god was made in mans image so he must have his price and the price would be rare it would not be an ordinary stone cathedral or a great pyramid his diamond cathedral would be superior that was his offer god could take it or leave it as he finished speaking his sentences became broken short and uncertain his hair had gradually turned white as he talked and now he lifted his head high to the heavens like an old prophet magnificently mad chapter seven the escape as john stared in amazement something very strange began happening around him the sky seemed to become dark for an instant and the wind started blowing there seemed to be trumpets playing far away for a time there was darkness and the birds songs stopped there seemed to be the sound of thunder that was all then the dawn continued as before and the sun rose the leaves laughed in the sun and their laughter moved the trees god had refused to accept the bribe for another moment john watched the beauty of the day then he turned and saw the airplanes land near the castle john ran down the side of the mountain where the two girls were awake they were waiting for him kismine jumped to her feet john knew there was no time for words they must get off the mountain immediately he took the hand of each girl and they silently moved through the trees in the morning light when they had gone about half a mile at a certain point they turned around and saw the mountain they had just left against the clear sky they saw a whitehaired man slowly coming down the mountain two enormous slaves followed him they were carrying the diamond between them which shone in the sun then two other figures joined them mrs washington and her son percy the pilots with their guns had gone from their airplanes to the front of the castle braddock washington and his group stopped by a rock the slaves pulled up a trapdoor in the side of the mountain they all disappeared into the trapdoor the whitehaired man first then his wife and son and finally the two slaves kismine pulled johns arm where are they going what are they going to do she cried wildly it must be some way of escape a little scream from the two girls interrupted his sentence dont you see cried kismine the mountain is going to explode they are going to destroy it before she finished speaking the color of the mountain became a bright yellow at the same time the castle exploded and there was a great fire and then nothing but smoke the pilots and the five people who had gone inside the mountain were certainly dead everything was destroyed and there was silence everywhere john and the two girls were alone in the valley at sunset they reached the high cliff which had marked the boundaries of the washingtons land they looked back at the beautiful valley which was now peaceful again they sat down to finish the food jasmine had brought with her in a basket there she said as she put the tablecloth on the grass and then put the sandwiches on it i always think food tastes better outdoors now john said empty your pockets and lets see what jewels you brought with you with a good selection of jewels we will be able to live well all our lives kismine put her hand in her pocket and took out a lot of shiny jewels not so bad cried john enthusiastically they arent very big but oh no his expression changed when he held one of them up to the sun why these arent diamonds something is wrong oh exclaimed kismine what an idiot i am why these are glass cried john i know she started laughing i opened the wrong drawer they belonged to a girl who visited jasmine she gave them to me in exchange for diamonds i had never seen anything but diamonds before and this is what you brought yes she said but i think i like these better im a bit tired of diamonds very well said john sadly well have to live in hades and you will grow old and tell women that you opened the wrong drawer and they will never believe you unfortunately your fathers bank books disappeared with him well whats the matter with hades if i come home with a wife at my age my father wont give me a penny jasmine spoke up i love washing she said quietly i have always washed my own handkerchiefs ill wash clothes for people and support both of you do they have laundry ladies in hades asked kismine innocently of course answered john its just like everywhere else i thought it was too hot to wear any clothes john laughed just try it he said theyll throw you out of town before you know whats happening will father be there she asked john looked at her in astonishment your father is dead he answered sadly why should he go to hades youve confused it with another place with the same name after dinner they put away the tablecloth and put out their blankets for the night what a dream it was kismine said looking up at the stars how strange it seems to be here under the stars with one dress and a poor fiancé under the stars she repeated i never noticed the stars before i always thought of them as great big diamonds that belonged to someone now they frighten me they make me feel that my youth was all a dream it was a dream said john quietly everybodys youth is a dream just a form of chemical madness how pleasant then to be mad cried kismine thats what im told said john let us love for a while for a year or so you and me thats a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try turn up your coat collar little girl its a cold night he covered himself with his blanket and fell asleep the end
