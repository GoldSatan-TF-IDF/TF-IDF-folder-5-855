the hairy ape scene i scene the firemens forecastle of a transatlantic liner an hour after sailing from new york for the voyage across tiers of narrow steel bunks three deep on all sides an entrance in rear benches on the floor before the bunks the room is crowded with men shouting cursing laughing singing a confused inchoate uproar swelling into a sort of unity a meaning the bewildered furious baffled defiance of a beast in a cage nearly all the men are drunk many bottles are passed from hand to hand all are dressed in dungaree pants heavy ugly shoes some wear singlets but the majority are stripped to the waist the treatment of this scene or of any other scene in the play should by no means be naturalistic the effect sought after is a cramped space in the bowels of a ship imprisoned by white steel the lines of bunks the uprights supporting them cross each other like the steel framework of a cage the ceiling crushes down upon the mens heads they cannot stand upright this accentuates the natural stooping posture which shovelling coal and the resultant overdevelopment of back and shoulder muscles have given them the men themselves should resemble those pictures in which the appearance of neanderthal man is guessed at all are hairychested with long arms of tremendous power and low receding brows above their small fierce resentful eyes all the civilized white races are represented but except for the slight differentiation in color of hair skin eyes all these men are alike the curtain rises on a tumult of sound yank is seated in the foreground he seems broader fiercer more truculent more powerful more sure of himself than the rest they respect his superior strength the grudging respect of fear then too he represents to them a selfexpression the very last

touching the sky fine strong men in them men that was sons of the sea as if twas the mother that bore them oh the clean skins of them and the clear eyes the straight backs and full chests of them

would be sinking low and dying out but wed give it no heed but a laugh and never a look behind for the day that was was enough for we was free men and im thinking tis only slaves do be giving heed to the day thats gone or the day to come until theyre old like me with a sort of religious exaltation oh to be scudding south again wid the power of the trade wind driving her on steady through the nights and the days full sail on her nights and days nights when the foam of the wake would be flaming wid fire when the skyd be blazing and winking wid stars or the full of the moon maybe then youd see her driving through the gray night her sails stretching aloft all silver and white not a sound on the deck the lot of us dreaming dreams till youd believetwas no real ship at all you was on but a ghost ship like the flying dutchman they say does be roaming the seas forevermore widout touching a port and there was the days too a warm sun on the clean decks sun warming the blood of you and wind over the miles of shiny green ocean like strong drink to your lungs work aye hard work but whod mind that at all sure you worked under the sky and twas work wid skill and daring to it and wid the day done in the dog watch smoking me pipe at ease the lookout would be raising land maybe and wed see the mountains of south americy wid the red fire of the setting sun painting their white tops and the

scornfully aw yuh make me sick yuh dont belong he strides out the door in rear paddy hums to himself blinking drowsily curtain scene ii scene two days out a section of the promenade deck mildred douglas and her aunt are discovered reclining in deck chairs the former is a girl of twenty slender delicate with a pale pretty face marred by a selfconscious expression of disdainful superiority she looks fretful nervous and discontented bored by her own anemia her aunt is a pompous and proud and fat old lady she is a type even to the point of a double chin and lorgnettes she is dressed pretentiously as if afraid her face alone would never indicate her position in life mildred is dressed all in white the impression to be conveyed by this scene is one of the beautiful vivid life of the sea all about sunshine on the deck in a great flood the fresh sea wind blowing across it in the midst of this these two incongruous artificial figures inert and disharmonious the elder like a gray lump of dough touched up with rouge the younger looking as if the vitality of her stock had been sapped before she was conceived so that she is the expression not of its life energy but merely of the artificialities that energy had won for itself in the spending mildred looking up with affected dreaminess how the black smoke swirls back against the sky is it not beautiful aunt without looking up i dislike smoke of any kind mildred my greatgrandmother smoked a pipe a clay pipe aunt ruffling vulgar mildred she was too distant a relative to be vulgar time mellows pipes aunt pretending boredom but irritated did the sociology you took up at college teach you that to play the ghoul on every possible occasion excavating old bones why not let your greatgrandmother rest in her grave mildred dreamily with her pipe beside her puffing in paradise aunt with spite yes you are a natural born ghoul you are even getting to look like one my dear mildred in a passionless tone i detest you aunt looking at her critically do you know what you remind me of of a cold pork pudding against a background of linoleum tablecloth in the kitchen of a but the possibilities are wearisome she closes her eyes aunt with a bitter laugh merci for your candor but since i am and must be your chaperone in appearance at least let us patch up some sort of armed truce for my part you are quite free to indulge any pose of eccentricity that beguiles you as long as you observe the amenities mildred drawling the inanities aunt going on as if she hadnt heard after exhausting the morbid thrills of social service work on new yorks east side how they must have hated you by the way the poor that you made so much poorer in their own eyes you are now bent on making your slumming international well i hope whitechapel will provide the needed nerve tonic do not ask me to chaperone you there however i told your father i would not i loathe deformity we will hire an army of detectives and you may investigate everything they allow you to see mildred protesting with a trace of genuine earnestness please do not mock at my attempts to discover how the other half lives give me credit for some sort of groping sincerity in that at least i would like to help them i would like to be some use in the world is it my fault i dont know how i would like to be sincere to touch life somewhere with weary bitterness but im afraid i have neither the vitality nor integrity all that was burnt out in our stock before i was born grandfathers blast furnaces flaming to the sky melting steel making millions then father keeping those home fires burning making more millions and little me at the tailend of it all im a waste product in the bessemer process like the millions or rather i inherit the acquired trait of the byproduct wealth but none of the energy none of the strength of the steel that made it i am sired by gold and darned by it as they say at the race track damned in more ways than one she laughs mirthlessly aunt unimpressed superciliously you seem to be going in for sincerity today it isnt becoming to you really except as an obvious pose be as artificial as you are i advise theres a sort of sincerity in that you know and after all you must confess you like that better mildred again affected and bored yes i suppose i do pardon me for my outburst when a leopard complains of its spots it must sound rather grotesque in a mocking tone purr little leopard purr scratch tear kill gorge yourself and be happy only stay in the jungle where your spots are camouflage in a cage they make you conspicuous aunt i dont know what you are talking about mildred it would be rude to talk about anything to you lets just talk she looks at her wrist watch well thank goodness its about time for them to come for me that ought to give me a new thrill aunt aunt affectedly troubled you dont mean to say youre really going the dirt the heat must be frightful mildred grandfather started as a puddler i should have inherited an immunity to heat that would make a salamander shiver it will be fun to put it to the test aunt but dont you have to have the captains or someones permission to visit the stokehole mildred with a triumphant smile i have it both his and the chief engineers oh they didnt want to at first in spite of my social service credentials they didnt seem a bit anxious that i should investigate how the other half lives and works on a ship so i had to tell them that my father the president of nazareth steel chairman of the board of directors of this line had told me it would be all right aunt he didnt mildred how naive age makes one but i said he did aunt i even said he had given me a letter to them which i had lost and they were afraid to take the chance that i might be lying excitedly so its ho for the stokehole the second engineer is to escort me looking at her watch again its time and here he comes i think the second engineer enters he is a husky finelooking man of thirtyfive or so he stops before the two and tips his cap visibly embarrassed and illatease second engineer miss douglas mildred yes throwing off her rugs and getting to her feet are we all ready to start second engineer in just a second maam im waiting for the fourth hes coming along mildred with a scornful smile you dont care to shoulder this responsibility alone is that it second engineer forcing a smile two are better than one disturbed by her eyes glances out to sea blurts out a fine day were having mildred is it second engineer a nice warm breeze mildred it feels cold to me second engineer but its hot enough in the sun mildred not hot enough for me i dont like nature i was never athletic second engineer forcing a smile well youll find it hot enough where youre going mildred do you mean hell second engineer flabbergasted decides to laugh hoho no i mean the stokehole mildred my grandfather was a puddler he played with boiling steel second engineer all at sea uneasily is that so hum youll excuse me maam but are you intending to wear that dress mildred why not second engineer youll likely rub against oil and dirt it cant be helped mildred it doesnt matter i have lots of white dresses second engineer i have an old coat you might throw over mildred i have fifty dresses like this i will throw this one into the sea when i come back that ought to wash it clean dont you think second engineer doggedly theres ladders to climb down that are none too clean and dark alleyways mildred i will wear this very dress and none other second engineer no offence meant its none of my business i was only warning you mildred warning that sounds thrilling second engineer looking down the deck with a sigh of relief theres the fourth now hes waiting for us if youll come mildred go on ill follow you he goes mildred turns a mocking smile on her aunt an oaf but a handsome virile oaf aunt scornfully poser mildred take care he said there were dark alleyways aunt in the same tone poser mildred biting her lips angrily you are right but would that my millions were not so anemically chaste aunt yes for a fresh pose i have no doubt you would drag the name of douglas in the gutter mildred from which it sprang goodby aunt dont pray too hard that i may fall into the fiery furnace aunt poser mildred viciously old hag she slaps her aunt insultingly across the face and walks off laughing gaily aunt screams after her i said poser curtain scene iii scene the stokehole in the rear the dimlyoutlined bulks of the furnaces and boilers high overhead one hanging electric bulb sheds just enough light through the murky air laden with coal dust to pile up masses of shadows everywhere a line of men stripped to the waist is before the furnace doors they bend over looking neither to right nor left handling their shovels as if they were part of their bodies with a strange awkward swinging rhythm they use the shovels to throw open the furnace doors then from these fiery round holes in the black a flood of terrific light and heat pours full upon the men who are outlined in silhouette in the crouching inhuman attitudes of chained gorillas the men shovel with a rhythmic motion swinging as on a pivot from the coal which lies in heaps on the floor behind to hurl it into the flaming mouths before them there is a tumult of noise the brazen clang of the furnace doors as they are flung open or slammed shut the grating teethgritting grind of steel against steel of crunching coal this clash of sounds stuns ones ears with its rending dissonance but there is order in it rhythm a mechanical regulated recurrence a tempo and rising above all making the air hum with the quiver of liberated energy the roar of leaping flames in the furnaces the monotonous throbbing beat of the engines as the curtain rises the furnace doors are shut the men are taking a breathing spell one or two are arranging the coal behind them pulling it into more accessible heaps the others can be dimly made out leaning on their shovels in relaxed attitudes of exhaustion paddy from somewhere in the line plaintively yerra will this divils own watch nivir end me back is broke im destroyed entirely yank from the center of the line with exuberant scorn aw yuh make me sick lie down and croak why dont yuh always beefin dats you say dis is a cinch dis was made for me its my meat get me a whistle is blown a thin shrill note from somewhere overhead in the darkness yank curses without resentment deres de damn engineer crakin de whip he tinks were loafin paddy vindictively god stiffen him yank in an exultant tone of command come on youse guys git into de game shes gittin hungry pile some grub in her trow it into her belly come on now all of youse open her up at this last all the men who have followed his movements of getting into position throw open their furnace doors with a deafening clang the fiery light floods over their shoulders as they bend round for the coal rivulets of sooty sweat have traced maps on their backs the enlarged muscles form bunches of high light and shadow yank chanting a count as he shovels without seeming effort one two tree his voice rising exultantly in the joy of battle dats de stuff let her have it all togedder now sling it into her let her ride shoot de piece now call de toin on her drive her into it feel her move watch her smoke speed dats her middle name give her coal youse guys coal dats her booze drink it up baby lets see yuh sprint dig in and gain a lap dere she gooes this last in the chanting formula of the gallery gods at the sixday bike race he slams his furnace door shut the others do likewise with as much unison as their wearied bodies will permit the effect is of one fiery eye after another being blotted out with a series of accompanying bangs paddy groaning me back is broke im bate out bate there is a pause then the inexorable whistle sounds again from the dim regions above the electric light there is a growl of cursing rage from all sides yank shaking his fist upward contemptuously take it easy dere you who dyuh tinks runnin dis game me or you when i git ready we move not before when i git ready get me voices approvingly thats the stuff yank tal him py golly yank aint affeerd goot poy yank give him hell tell im es a bloody swine bloody slavedriver yank contemptuously he aint got no noive hes yellow get me all de engineers is

gotter feed de baby come on he turns and flings his furnace door open they all follow his lead at this instant the second and fourth engineers enter from the darkness on the left with mildred between them she starts turns paler her pose is crumbling she shivers with fright in spite of the blazing heat but forces herself to leave the engineers and take a few steps nearer the men she is right behind yank all this happens quickly while the men have their backs turned yank come on youse guys he is turning to get coal when the whistle sounds again in a peremptory irritating note this drives yank into a sudden fury while the other men have turned full around and stopped dumfounded by the spectacle of mildred standing there in her white dress yank does not turn far enough to see her besides his head is thrown back he blinks upward through the murk trying to find the owner of the whistle he brandishes his shovel murderously over his head in one hand pounding on his chest gorillalike with the other shouting toin off dat whistle come down outa dere yuh yellow brassbuttoned belfast bum yuh come down and ill knock yer brains out yuh lousey stinkin yellow mut of a catholicmoiderin bastard come

yuh lousey boob yuh dirty crummy muckeatin son of a suddenly he becomes conscious of all the other men staring at something directly behind his back he whirls defensively with a snarling murderous growl crouching to spring his lips drawn back over his teeth his small eyes gleaming ferociously he sees mildred like a white apparition in the full light from the open furnace doors he glares into her eyes turned to stone as for her during his speech she has listened paralyzed with horror terror her whole personality crushed beaten in collapsed by the terrific impact of this unknown abysmal brutality naked and shameless as she looks at his gorilla face as his eyes bore into hers she utters a low choking cry and shrinks away from him putting both hands up before her eyes to shut out the sight of his face to protect her own this startles yank to a reaction his mouth falls open his eyes grow bewildered mildred about to faint to the engineers who now have her one by each arm whimperingly take me away oh the filthy beast she faints they carry her quickly back disappearing in the darkness at the left rear an iron door clangs shut rage and bewildered fury rush back on yank he feels himself insulted in some unknown fashion in the very heart of his pride he roars god damn yuh and hurls his shovel after them at the door which has just closed it hits the steel bulkhead with a clang and falls clattering on the steel floor from overhead the whistle sounds again in a long angry insistent command curtain scene iv scene the firemens forecastle yanks watch has just come off duty and had dinner their faces and bodies shine from a soap and water scrubbing but around their eyes where a hasty dousing does not touch the coal dust sticks like black makeup giving them a queer sinister expression yank has not washed either face or body he stands out in contrast to them a blackened brooding figure he is seated forward on a bench in the exact attitude of rodins the thinker the others most of them smoking pipes are staring at yank halfapprehensively as if fearing an outburst halfamusedly as if they saw a joke somewhere that tickled them voices he aint ate nothin py golly

from which the word gorilla stands out the gigantic animal himself is seen squatting on his haunches on a bench in much the same attitude as rodins thinker yank enters from the left immediately a chorus of angry chattering and screeching breaks out the gorilla turns his eyes but makes no sound or move yank with a hard bitter laugh welcome to your city huh hail hail de gangs all here at the sound of his voice the chattering dies away into an attentive silence yank walks up to the gorillas cage and leaning over the railing stares in at its occupant who stares back at him silent and motionless there is a pause of dead stillness then yank begins to talk in a friendly confidential tone halfmockingly but with a deep undercurrent of sympathy say yuhre some hardlookin guy aint yuh i
