door leading into curtis study in the rear center a double doorway opening on the hall and the entryway bookcases are built into the wall on both sides of this doorway in the far right corner a grand piano three large windows looking out on the lawn and another armchair front are on this right side of the room opposite the fireplace is a couch facing front opposite the windows on the right is a long table with magazines reading lamp etc four chairs are grouped about the table the walls and ceiling are in a french gray color a great rug covers most of the hardwood floor it is around four oclock of a fine afternoon in early fall as the curtain rises martha curtis and bigelow are discovered martha is a healthy finelooking woman of thirtyeight she does not appear this age for her strenuous life in the open has kept her young and fresh she possesses the frank clear direct quality of outdoors outspoken and generous her wavy hair is a dark brown her eyes bluegray curtis jayson is a tall rangy broadshouldered man of thirtyseven while spare his figure has an appearance of rugged health of great nervous strength held in reserve his squarejawed largefeatured face retains an eager boyish enthusiasm in spite of its prevailing expression of thoughtful preoccupied aloofness his crisp dark hair is graying at the temples edward bigelow is a large handsome man of thirtynine his face shows culture and tolerance a sense of humor a lazy unambitious contentment curtis is reading an article in some scientific periodical seated by the table martha and bigelow are sitting nearby laughing and chatting bigelow is talking with a comically worried but earnest air do you know im getting so im actually afraid to leave them alone with that governess shes too romantic ill wager shes got a whole book full of ghost stories superstitions and yellowjournal horrors up her sleeve martha oh pooh dont go milling around for trouble when i was a kid i used to get fun out of my horrors bigelow but i imagine you were more courageous than most of us martha why bigelow well nevada the far west at that time i should think a child would have grown so accustomed to violent scenes martha smiling oh in the mining camps but you dont suppose my father lugged me along on his prospecting trips do you why i never saw any rough scenes until id finished with school and went to live with father in goldfield bigelow smiling and then you met curt martha yes but i didnt mean he was a rough scene he was very mild even in those days do tell me what he was like at cornell bigelow a romanticist and he still is martha pointing at curtis with gay mischief what that sedate man never curtis looking up and smiling at them both affectionately lazily dont mind him martha he always was crazy bigelow to curt accusingly why did you elect to take up mining engineering at cornell instead of a classical degree at the yale of your fathers and brothers because you had been reading bret harte in prep school and mistaken him for a modern realist you devoted four years to grooming yourself for another outcast of poker flat martha laughs curtis grinning it was you who were hypnotized by harte so much so that his west of the past is still your blinded new englandmovie idea of the west at present but go on what next bigelow next you get a job as engineer in that goldfield mine but you are soon disillusioned by a laborious life where sixshooters are as rare as nuggets you try prospecting you find nothing but different varieties of pebbles but it is necessary to your nature to project romance into these stones so you go in strong for geology as a geologist you become a slave to the romance of the rocks it is but a step from that to anthropology the last romance of all there you find yourself because there is no further to go you win fame as the most proficient of young skullhunters and wander over the face of the globe digging up bones like an old dog curtis with a laugh the man is mad martha bigelow mad what an accusation to come from one who is even now considering setting forth on a fiveyear excavating contest in search of the remains of our gibbering ancestor the first man curtis with sudden seriousness im not considering it any longer ive decided to go martha starting the hurt showing in her voice when did you decide curtis i only really came to a decision this morning with a seriousness that forces bigelows interested attention its a case of got to go its a tremendous opportunity that it would be a crime for me to neglect bigelow and a big honor too isnt it to be picked as a member of such a large affair curtis with a smile i guess its just that they want all the men with considerable practical experience they can get there are bound to be hardships and they know im hardened to them turning to his wife with an affectionate smile we havent roughed it in the queer corners for the last ten years without knowing how its done have we martha martha dully no curt curtis with an earnest enthusiasm and this expedition is what you call a large affair big its the largest thing of its kind ever undertaken the possibilities from the standpoint of anthropology are limitless bigelow with a grin aha now we come to the missing link curtis frowning darn your barnum and bailey circus lingo big this isnt a thing to mock at i should think the origin of man would be something that would appeal even to your hothouse imagination modern science believes knows that asia was the first home of the human race thats where were going to the great central asian plateau north of the himalayas bigelow more soberly and there you hope to dig up our first ancestor curtis its a chance in a million but i believe we may myself at least find authentic traces of him so that we can reconstruct his life and habits i was up in that country a lot while i was mining advisor to the chinese government did some of my own work on the side the extraordinary results i obtained with the little means at my disposal convinced me of the riches yet to be uncovered the first man may be among them bigelow turning to martha and you were with him on that asian plateau martha yes ive always been with him curtis you bet she has he goes over and puts his hand on his wifes shoulder affectionately marthas more efficient than a whole staff of assistants and secretaries she knows more about what im doing than i do half the time he turns toward his study well i guess ill go in and work some martha quietly do you need me now curt bigelow starting up yes if you two want to work together why just shoo me curtis puts both hands on his shoulders and forces him to his seat again no sit down big i dont need martha now coming over to her bends down and kisses her rather mockingly i couldnt deprive big of an audience for his confessions of a fond parent bigelow aha now its you who are mocking at something you know nothing about an awkward silence follows this remark curtis frowning i guess youre forgetting arent you big he turns and walks into his study closing the door gently behind him martha after a pause sadly poor curt bigelow ashamed and confused i had forgotten martha the years have made me reconciled they havent curt she sighs then turns to bigelow with a forced smile i suppose its hard for any of you back here to realize that curt and i ever had any children bigelow after a pause how old were they when martha three years and two both girls she goes on sadly we had a nice little house in goldfield forcing a smile we were very respectable home folks then the wandering came later after it was a sunday in winter when curt and i had gone visiting some friends the nurse girl fell asleep or something and the children sneaked out in their underclothes and played in the snow pneumonia set in and a week later they were both dead bigelow shocked good heavens martha we were real lunatics for a time and then when wed calmed down enough to realize how things stood with us we swore wed never have children again to steal away their memory it wasnt what you thought romanticism that set curt wandering and me with him it was a longing to lose ourselves to forget he flung himself with all his power into every new study that interested him he couldnt keep still mentally or bodily and i followed he needed me then so dreadfully bigelow and is it that keeps driving him on now martha oh no hes found himself his work has taken the place of the children bigelow and with you too martha with a wan smile well ive helped all i could his work has me in it i like to think and i have him bigelow shaking his head i think people are foolish to stand by such an oath as you took forever with a smile children are a great comfort in ones old age ive tritely found martha smiling old age bigelow im knocking at the door of fatal forty martha with forced gaiety youre not very tactful i must say dont you know im thirtyeight bigelow gallantly a woman is as old as she looks youre not thirty yet martha laughing after that nice remark ill have to forgive you everything wont i lily jayson comes in from the rear she is a slender rather pretty girl of twentyfive the stamp of college student is still very much about her she rather insists on a superior intellectual air is full of nervous thwarted energy at the sight of them sitting on the couch together her eyebrows are raised lily coming into the room breezily hello martha hello big they both get up with answering hellos i walked right in regardless hope im not interrupting martha not at all lily sitting down by the table as martha and bigelow resume their seats on the lounge i must say it sounded serious i heard you tell big youd forgive him everything martha dryly with a mocking glance at bigelow youre letting yourself in for a large proposition bigelow displeased but trying to smile it off the past is never past for a dog with a bad name eh lily lily laughs bigelow gets up if you want to reward me for my truthfulness mrs jayson help me take the kids for an airing in the car i know its an imposition but theyve grown to expect you glancing at his watch by jove ill have to run along ill get them and then pick you up here is that all right martha fine bigelow ill run then goodby lily she nods bigelow goes out rear martha cordially come on over here lily lily sits on couch with martha after a pause with a smile you were forgetting werent you martha what lily that youd invited all the family over here to tea this afternoon im the advance guard martha embarrassed so i was how stupid lily with an inquisitive glance at marthas face but with studied carelessness do you like bigelow martha yes very much and curt thinks the world of him lily oh curt is the last one to be bothered by anyones morals curt and i are the unconventional ones of the family the trouble with bigelow martha is that he was too careless to conceal his sins and that wont go down in this philistine small town you have to hide and be a fellow hypocrite or they revenge themselves on you bigelow didnt he flaunted his loveaffairs in everyones face i used to admire him for it no one exactly blamed him in their secret hearts his wife was a terrible straitlaced creature no man could have endured her disgustedly after her death he suddenly acquired a bad conscience hed never noticed the children before ill bet he didnt even know their names and then presto hes about in our midst giving an imitation of a wet hen with a brood of ducks its a bore if you ask me martha flushing i think its very fine of him lily shaking her head his reform is too sudden hes joined the hypocrites i think martha im sure hes no hypocrite when you see him with the children lily oh i know hes a good actor lots of women have been in love with him then suddenly you wont be furious if im very very frank will you martha martha surprised no of course not lily lily well im the bearer of a message from the jayson family martha astonished a message for me lily dont think that i have anything to do with it im only a victor record of their misgivings shall i switch it going well then father thinks brother john and wife sister esther and husband all think that you are unwisely intimate with this same bigelow martha stunned i unwisely intimate suddenly laughing with amusement well you sure are funny people lily no were not funny wed be all right if we were on the contrary were very dull and deadly bigelow really has a villainous rep for philandering but of course you didnt know that martha beginning to feel resentful coldly no i didnt and i dont care to know it now lily calmly i told them you wouldnt relish their silly advice in a very confidential friendly tone oh i hate their narrow smalltown ethics as much as you do martha i sympathize with you indeed i do but i have to live with them and so for comforts sake ive had to make compromises and youre going to live in our midst from now on arent you well then youll have to make compromises too if you want any peace martha butcompromises about what forcing a laugh i refuse to take it seriously how anyone could think its too absurd lily what set them going was bigs being around such an awful lot the weeks curt was in new york just after youd settled down here you must acknowledge he wasvery much present then martha martha but it was on account of his children they were always with him lily the town doesnt trust this sudden fond parenthood martha weve known him too long you see martha but hes curts oldest and best friend lily weve found they always are martha springing to her feet indignantly its a case of evil minds it seems to me and it would be extremely insulting if i didnt have a sense of humor resentfully you can tell your family that as far as im concerned the town may lily go to the devil i knew youd say that well fight the good fight you have all my best wishes with a sigh i wish i had something worth fighting for now that im through with college my occupations gone all i do is read book after book the only live people are the ones in books i find and the only live life martha immediately sympathetic youre lonely thats what lily lily drily dont pity me martha or ill join the enemy martha im not but id like to help you if i could after a pause have you ever thought of marrying lily with a laugh martha how banal the men i see are enough to banish that thought if i ever had it martha marriage isnt only the man its children wouldnt you like to have children lily turning to her bluntly wouldnt you martha confused but lily lily oh i know it wasnt practicable as long as you elected to wander with curt but why not now when youve definitely settled down here i think that would solve things all round if you could present father with a grandson im sure hed fall on your neck he feels piqued at the john and esther families because theyve had a run of girls a male jayson aunt davidson would weep with joy suddenly youre thirtyeight arent you martha martha yes lily then why dont you before its too late martha struggling with herself does not answer lily goes on slowly you wont want to tag along with curt to the ends of the earth forever will you curiously wasnt that queer life like any other i mean didnt it get to pall on you martha as if confessing it reluctantly yes perhaps in the last two years lily decisively its time for both of you to rest on your laurels why cant curt keep on with what hes doing now stay home and write his books martha curt isnt that kind the actual work the romance of it thats his life lily but if he goes and you have to stay youll be lonesome meaningly alone martha horribly i dont know what ill do lily then why why think martha if curt knew that was to happen hed want to stay here with you im sure he would martha shaking her head sadly no curt has grown to dislike children they remind him of ours that were taken he adored them so hes never become reconciled lily if you confronted curt with the actual fact hed be reconciled soon enough and happy in the bargain martha eagerly do you really think so lily and you martha i can tell from the way youve talked that youd like to martha excitedly yes i i never thought id ever want to again for many years after they died i never once dreamed of it but lately the last years ive felt and when we came to live here and i saw all around me homes and children i she hesitates as if ashamed at having confessed so much lily putting an arm around her affectionately i know vigorously you must thats all there is to it if you want my advice you go right ahead and dont tell curt until its a fact hell have to learn to like willynilly youll find in his inmost heart hell be tickled to death martha forcing a smile yes i ill confess i thought of that in spite of my fear i ive i mean i she flushes in a shamed confusion lily looking at her searchingly why martha what then suddenly understanding with excited pleasure martha i know it is so isnt it it is martha in a whisper yes lily kissing her affectionately you dear you then after a pause how long have you known martha for over two months there is a ring from the front door bell in the hall lily jumping up ill bet thats we jaysons now she runs to the door in the rear and looks down the hall to the right yes its esther and husband and aunt davidson she comes back to martha laughing excitedly the maid is seen going to the door the first wave of attack martha be brave the young guard dies but never surrenders martha displeased but forcing a smile you make me feel terribly ill at ease when you put it that way lily she rises now and goes to greet the visitors who enter mrs davidson is seventyfive years old a thin sinewy old lady oldfashioned unbending and rigorous in manner she is dressed aggressively in the fashion of a bygone age esther is a stout middleaged woman with the round unmarked sentimentally contented face of one who lives unthinkingly from day to day sheltered in an assured position in her little world mark her husband is a lean tall stooping man of about fortyfive his long face is alert shrewd cautious full of the superficial craftiness of the lawyer mind martha kisses the two women shakes hands with mark uttering the usual meaningless greetings in a forced tone they reply in much the same spirit there is the buzz of this empty chatter while martha gets them seated lily stands looking on with a cynical smile of amusement mrs davidson is in the chair at the end of table ieft esther sits by martha on couch mark in chair at front of table will you have tea now or shall we wait for the others esther lets wait they ought to be here any moment lily maliciously just think martha had forgotten you were coming she was going motoring with bigelow there is a dead silence at this broken diplomatically by sheffield sheffield where is curt martha martha hard at work in his study im afraid hes there for the day sheffield condescendingly still plugging away at his book i suppose well i hope it will be a big success lily irritated by his smugness as big a success as the brief youre writing to restrain the citizens from preventing the traction company robbing them eh mark before anyone can reply she turns suddenly on her aunt who is sitting rigidly on her chair staring before her stonily like some old lady in a daguerreotype in a loud challenging tone you dont mind if i smoke aunt she takes a cigarette out of case and lights it esther smiling lily mrs davidson fixes lily with her stare in a tone of irrevocable decision well get you married young lady and that very soon what you need to bring you down to earth is a husband and the responsibility of children turning her glance to martha a challenge in her question every woman who is able should have children dont you believe that martha jayson she accentuates the full name martha taken aback for a moment but restraining her resentment gently yes i do mrs davidson mes davidson seemingly placated by this reply in a milder tone you must call me aunt my dear meaningly all the jaysons do martha simply thank you aunt lily as if all of this aroused her irritation in a nervous fuming why dont the others come darn em im dying for my tea the door from the study is opened and curt appears they all greet him curtis absentmindedly hello everybody then with a preoccupied air to martha martha i dont want to interrupt you but martha getting up briskly you want my help curtis with the same absentminded air yes not for long just a few notes before i forget them he goes back into the study martha seemingly relieved by this interruption and glad of the chance it gives to show them her importance to curt youll excuse me for a few moments all of you wont you they all nod mrs davidson rather harshly why doesnt curt hire a secretary that is no work for his wife martha quietly a paid secretary could hardly give the sympathy and understanding curt needs mrs davidson proudly and she would have to study for years as i have done in order to take my place to lily if i am not here by the time the others arrive will you see about the tea lily lily eagerly sure i love to serve drinks if i were a man id be a bartender in mexico or canada martha going toward the study ill be with you again in a minute i hope she goes in and shuts the door behind her esther pettishly even people touched by a smattering of science seem to get rude dont they mrs davidson harshly i have heard much silly talk of this being an age of free women and i have always said it was tommyrot pointing to the study she is an example she is more of a slave to curts hobbies than any of my generation were to anything but their children still more harshly where are her children lily they died aunt as children have a bad habit of doing then meaningly however i wouldnt despair if i were you mrs davidson stares at her fixedly esther betraying a sudden frightened jealousy what do you mean lily what are you so mysterious about what did she say what lily mockingly mark your frau seems to have me on the stand can i refuse to answer there is a ring at the bell lily jumps to her feet excitedly here comes the rest of our grand fleet now ill have my tea she darts out to the hallway esther shaking her head goodness lily is trying on the nerves jayson his two sons john and dick and johns wife emily enter from hallway in rear jayson the father is a short stout baldheaded man of sixty a typical smalltown new england bestfamily banker reserved in pose unobtrusively important a placid exterior hiding querulousness and a fussy temper john junior is his father over again in appearance but pompous obtrusive purseandfamilyproud extremely irritating in his selfcomplacent air of authority emptily assertive and loud he is about forty richard the other brother is a typical young casino and country club member collegebred good looking not unlikable he has been an officer in the war and has not forgotten it emily john jrs wife is one of those small mouselike women who conceal beneath an outward aspect of gentle unprotected innocence a very active envy a silly pride and a mean malice the people in the room with the exception of mrs davidson rise to greet them all exchange familiar perfunctory greetings sheffield relinquishes his seat in front of the table to jayson going to the chair right front himself john and dick take the two chairs to the rear of table emily joins esther on the couch and they whisper together excitedly esther doing most of the talking the men remain in uncomfortable silence for a moment dick with gay mockery well the gangs all here looks like the league of nations then with impatience lets get down to cases folks i want to know why ive been summoned here im due for tournament mixeddoubles at the casino at five wheres the tea and has curt a stick in the cellar to put in it lily appearing in the doorway heres tea but no stick for you sot the maid brings in tray with tea things john heavily it seems it would be more to the point to inquire where our hostess jayson rousing himself again yes and where is curt lily working at his book he called martha to take notes on something esther with a trace of resentment she left us as if she were glad of the excuse lily stuff esther she knows how much curt depends on her and we dont emily in her quiet lisping voice with the most innocent air martha seems to be a model wife but there is some quality to the way she says it that makes them all stare at her uneasily lily insultingly how well you say what you dont mean emily twinkle twinkle little bat but im forgetting to do the honors tea everybody without waiting for any answer tea everybody the tea is served jayson impatiently stop fooling lily lets get to our muttons did you talk with martha lily briskly i did sir jayson in a lowered voice what did she say lily she said you could all go to the devil they all look shocked and insulted lily enjoys this then adds quietly oh not in those words martha is a perfect lady but she made it plain she will thank you to mind your own business esther volubly and just imagine shed even forgotten shed asked us here this afternoon and was going motoring with bigelow lily with his three children too dont forget emily softly they have become such wellbehaved and intelligent children they say again all the others hesitate staring at her suspiciously lily sharply youd better let martha train yours for a while emily im sure shed improve their manners though of course she couldnt give them any intelligence emily with the pathos of outraged innocence oh dick interrupting so its bigelow youre up in the air about he gives a low whistle then frowns angrily the deuce you say lily mockingly look at our soldier boy home from the wars getting serious about the family honor its too bad this is a rough untutored country where they dont permit dueling isnt it dick dick his pose crumbling angrily go to the devil sheffield with a calm judicious air this wrangling is getting us nowhere you say she was resentful about our wellmeant word to the wise jayson testily surely she must realize that some consideration is due the position she occupies in bridgetown as curts wife lily martha is properly unimpressed by big frogs in tiny puddles and there you are mrs davidson outraged the idea she takes a lot upon herself the daughter of a wild western coalminer lily mockingly gold miner aunt mrs davidson it makes no difference a common miner sheffield keenly inquisitive just before the others came lily you gave out some hints very definite hints i should say esther excitedly yes you did lily what did you mean lily uncertainly perhaps i shouldnt have its not my secret enjoying herself immensely now that she holds the spotlight after a pause in a stage whisper shall i tell you yes i cant help telling well martha is going to have a son they are all stunned and flabbergasted and stare at her speechlessly mrs davidson her face lighting up joyously a son curts son jayson pleased by the idea but bewildered a son dick smartly lilys kidding you how can she know its a son unless shes a clairvoyant esther with glad relief yes how stupid lily i am clairvoyant in this case allah is great and it will be a son if only to make you and emily burst with envy among your daughters esther lily emily oh jayson testily keep still for a moment lily for gods sake this is no subject to joke about remember lily martha told me i know that jayson and does curt know this lily no not yet martha has been afraid to tell him jayson ah that explains matters you know i asked curt some time ago and he said it was impossible emily with a lift of her eyebrows impossible why what a funny thing to say sheffield keenly lawyerlike and why is martha afraid to tell him lily lily its all very simple when the two died years ago they said they would never have one again martha thinks curt is still haunted by their memory and is afraid he will resent another as an intruder i told her that was all foolishness that a child was the one thing to make curt settle down for good at home here and write his books jayson eagerly yes i believe that myself pleased well this is fine news emily still it was her duty to tell curt dont you think i dont see how she could be afraid of curt for those reasons they all stare at her esther resentfully i dont either why curts the biggesthearted and kindest emily i wonder how long shes known this lily sharply two months she said emily two months she lets this sink in john quickly scenting something eagerly what do you mean emily then as if he read her mind two months but before that curt was away in new york almost a month lily turning on emily fiercely so you got someone to say it for you as you always do poison mind oh i wish the ducking stool had never been abolished emily growing crimson falteringly i i didnt mean john furiously where the honor of the family is at stake lily fiercely ssshh you empty barrel i think i hear the door from the study is opened and martha comes in in the midst of a heavy silence all the gentlemen rise stiffly martha is made immediately selfconscious and resentful by the feeling that they have been discussing her unfavorably martha coming forward with a forced cordiality how do you do everybody so sorry i wasnt here when you came i hope lily made proper excuses for me she goes from one to the other of the four latest comers with so glad you came etc they reply formally and perfunctorily martha finally finds a seat on the couch between emily and esther i hope lily but i see youve all had tea lily trying to save the situation gayly yes you can trust me as understudy for the part of hostess any time martha forcing a smile well im glad to know i wasnt missed emily sweetly we were talking about you at least we were listening to lily talk about you martha stiffening defensively about me emily yes about how devoted you were to curts work lily gives her a venomous glance of scorn martha pleased but inwardly uneasy oh but you see i consider it my work too ive helped him with it so long now jayson in a forced tone and how is curts book coming martha martha more and more stung by their strained attitudes and inquisitive glances coldly and cuttingly finely thank you the book will cause quite a stir i believe it will make the name of jayson famous in the big world outside of bridgetown mrs davidson indignantly the name of jayson has been jayson pleadingly aunt elizabeth lily aunt means its world famous already martha pointing to the sullen john john was once a substitute on the yale freshman soccer team you know if it wasnt for his weak shins he would have made the team fancy dick this tickles his sense of humor and he bursts into laughter lily wins as his brother glares at him looking at his watch heavens ill have to hustle gets to his feet im due at the casino comes and shakes marthas hand formally im sorry i cant stay martha so glad you came do come in again any time we keep open house you know western fashion she accentuates this dick hurriedly delighted to he starts for the door in rear lily as if suddenly making up her mind wait a second im coming with you dick sure thing only hurry darn you he goes out lily stops at the door in rear and catching marthas eye looks meaningly at the others phew i need fresh air she makes an encouraging motion as if pummeling someone to martha indicating her assembled family as the victim then goes out laughing a motor is heard starting running off esther with a huge sigh of relief thank goodness shes gone what a vixen what would you do if you had a sister like that martha martha id love her and try to understand her sheffield meaningly shes a bad ally to rely on this side of the fence one day and that the next martha is that why you advised her to become a lawyer mr sheffield sheffield stung but maintaining an unruffled front now now that remark must be catalogued as catty martha defiantly it seems to be in the bridgetown atmosphere i never was not the least bit in the open air jayson conciliatingly oh bridgetown isnt so bad martha once you get used to us john its one of the most prosperous and wealthy towns in the us and that means in the world nowadays emily with her sugary smile that isnt what martha means you silly i know what shes thinking about us and im not sure that i dont agree with her partly she feels that were so awfully strict about certain things it must be so different in the far west i suppose so much freer martha acidly then you believe broadmindedness and clean thinking are a question of locality i cant agree with you i know nothing of the present far west not having lived there for ten years but curt and i have lived in the far east and im sure hed agree with me in saying that chinese ancestor worship is far more dignified than ours after all you know theirs is religion not snobbery there is a loud honking of an auto horn before the house martha starts seems to come to a quick decision and announces with studied carelessness that must be mr bigelow i suppose lily told you i had an engagement to go motoring with him so sorry i must leave but im like lily i need fresh air she walks to the study door as she is talking ill call curt she raps loudly on the door and calls curt come out its important she turns and goes to the door smiling fixedly hell be out when hes through swearing she goes out rear john exploding well of all the damned cheek esther she shows her breeding i must say emily with horror oh how rude and insulting mrs davidson rising rigidly to her feet i will never set foot in this house again jayson jumping up to restrain her worriedly now aunt elizabeth do keep your head we must have no scandal of any sort remember there are servants about do sit down the old lady refuses in stubborn silence sheffield judiciously one must make allowances for one in her condition aunt jayson snatching at this exactly remember her condition aunt testily and do sit down the old lady plumps herself down again angrily emily in her lisp of hidden meanings yes the family mustnt forget her condition the door from the study is opened and curt appears his face shows his annoyance at being interrupted his eyes are preoccupied they all turn and greet him embarrassedly he nods silently and comes slowly down front curtis looking around wheres martha whats the important thing she called me out for esther forcing gaiety to play host you big bear you dont you think we came to see you too sit down here and be good he sits on sofa emily softly martha had to leave us to go motoring with mr bigelow esther hastily and the three children curtis frowning grumpily hm big and his eternal kids he sighs they exchange meaning glances curt seems to feel ashamed of his grumpiness and tries to fling it off with a cheerful smile but what the deuce i must be getting selfish to grudge martha her bit of fresh air you dont know what it means to outdoor animals like us to be pent up he springs to his feet and paces back and forth nervously were used to living with the sky for a roof then interestedly did martha tell you id definitely decided to go on the five year asian expedition esther curt youre not emily and leave martha here all alone for five years jayson yes you cant take martha with you this time you know curtis with a laugh no what makes you so sure of that as they look mystified he continues confidentially ill let you in on the secret only you must all promise not to breathe a word to martha until tomorrow tomorrow is her birthday you know and this is a surprise ive saved for her they all nod ive been intriguing my damnedest for the past month to get permission for martha to go with me it was difficult because women are supposed to be barred happily but ive succeeded the letter came this morning how tickled to death shell be when she hears i know shes given up hope thoughtfully i suppose its that has been making her act so outofsorts lately jayson worriedly hmm but would you persist in going alone if you knew it was impossible for her curtis frowning i cant imagine it without her you people cant have any idea what a help a chum shes been you cant believe that a woman could be so much that in a life of that kind how ive grown to depend on her the thousand details she attends to them all she remembers everything why id be lost i wouldnt know how to start with a laugh i know this sounds like a confession of weakness but its true just the same frowning again however naturally my work must always be the first consideration yes absolutely then with glad relief but whats the use of rambling on this way we can both go thank heaven mrs davidson sternly no she cannot go and it is your duty curtis interrupting her with a trace of impatience oh come thats all nonsense aunt you dont understand the kind of woman martha is mrs davidson harshly the women i understand prefer rearing their children to selfish gallivanting over the

word go your own road and work your own ruin curtis brusquely i think ill change my togs and go for a walk excuse me for a second ill be right down again he goes out rear emily with her false air of innocence curt acts so funny doesnt he did you notice how emphatic he was about its being impossible and he said martha seemed to him to be acting queer lately with him i suppose he meant esther he certainly appeared put out when he heard shed gone motoring with big jayson moodily this dislike of the very mention of children it isnt like curt not a bit john theres something rotten in denmark somewhere this family will yet live to regret having accepted a stranger sheffield mollifyingly with a judicial air come now this is all only suspicion there is no evidence you have no case and the defendant is innocent until you have proved her guilty remember getting to his feet well lets break up esther you and i ought to be getting home they all rise jayson testily well if i were sure it would all blow over without any open scandal id offer up a prayer of thanks the curtain falls act ii scene curtis jaysons study on the left forward a gun rack in which are displayed several varieties of rifles and shotguns farther back three windows looking out on the garden in the rear wall an open fireplace with two leather armchairs in front of it to right of fireplace a door leading into the livingroom in the far right corner another chair in the right wall three windows looking out on the lawn and garden on this side front a typewriting table with machine and chair opposite the windows on the right a bulky leather couch facing front in front of the windows on the left a long table with stacks of paper piled here and there on it reference books etc on the left of table a swivel chair gray oak bookcases are built into the cream rough plaster walls which are otherwise almost hidden from view by a collection of all sorts of hunters trophies animal heads of all kinds the floor is covered with animal skins tiger polar bear leopard lion etc skins are also thrown over the backs of the chairs the sections of the bookcase not occupied by scientific volumes have been turned into a specimen case for all sorts of zoological geological anthropological oddities it is midmorning sunny and bright of the following day curtis and bigelow are discovered curtis is halfsitting on the corner of the table left smoking a pipe bigelow is lying sprawled on the couch through the open windows on the right come the shouts of children playing marthas voice joins in with theirs bigelow listen to that rumpus will you the kids are having the time of their lives he goes to the window and looks out delightedly your wife is playing hide and seek with them come and look curtis with a trace of annoyance oh i can see well enough from here bigelow with a laugh she seems to get as much fun out of it as they do as a shriek comes from outside excitedly ah eddy discovered her behind the tree isnt he tickled now he turns back from the window and lights a cigarette enthusiastically jove what a hand she is with children curtis as if the subject bored him oh martha gets along well with anyone bigelow sits on the couch again with a sceptical smile you think so with everyone curtis surprised yes with everyone weve ever come in contact with even aboriginal natives bigelow with the aboriginal natives of bridgetown with the wellknown jayson family for example curtis getting to his feet frowning why everythings all right between martha and them isnt it what do you mean big i certainly imagined but ill confess this damn book has had me so preoccupied bigelow too darn preoccupied if youll pardon my saying so its not fair to leave her to fight it alone curtis impatiently fight what martha has a sense of humor im sure their petty prejudices merely amuse her bigelow sententiously a mosquito is a ridiculous amusing creature seen under a microscope but when a swarm has been stinging you all night curtis a broad grin coming over his face you speak from experience eh bigelow smiling you bet i do touch me anywhere and youll find a bite this my native town did me the honor of devoting its entire leisure attention for years to stinging me to death curtis well if i am to believe onetenth of the family letters i used to receive on the subject of my old friend bigelow they sure had just cause bigelow oh ill play fair ill admit they did then but its exasperating to know they never give you credit for changing i almost said reforming one ought to be above the gossip of a town like this but say what you like it does get under your skin curtis with an indulgent smile so youd like to be known as a reformed character eh bigelow rather ruefully et tu your tone is sceptical but i swear to you curt im an absolutely new man since my wifes death since ive grown to love the children before that i hardly knew them they were hers not mine it seemed his face lighting up now were the best of pals and ive commenced to appreciate life from a different angle ive found a career at last the children the finest career a man could have i believe curtis indifferently yes i suppose so if youre made that way bigelow meaning youre not curtis not any more frowning i tried that once bigelow after a pause with a smile but were wandering from the subject of martha versus the mosquitoes curtis with a short laugh oh to the deuce with that trust martha to take care of herself besides ill have her out of this stagnant hole before so very long six months to be exact bigelow where do you think of settling her then curtis no settling about it im going to take her with me bigelow surprised on the asian expedition curtis yes i havent told her yet but im going to today its her birthday and ive been saving the news to surprise her with bigelow her birthday i wish the children and i had known but its not too late yet curtis with a grin thirtynine candles if youre thinking of baking a cake bigelow meaningly thats not old but its not young either curt curtis disgustedly you talk like an old woman big what have years to do with it martha is young in spirit and always will be there is a knock at the door and marthas voice calling may i come in people sure thing bigelow jumps to open the door and martha enters she is flushed excited full of the joy of life panting from her exertions martha laughing ive had to run away and leave them with the governess theyre too active for me she throws herself on the couch phew im all tired out i must be getting old curtis with a grin big was just this minute remarking that martha bigelow looks embarrassed martha laughing at him well i declare of all the horrid things to hear bigelow still embarrassed but forcing a joking tone he prevaricates mrs jayson martha there now curt im sure it was you who said it it sounds just like one of your horrid facts bigelow and how can i offer my felicitations now but i do despite your husbands calumny may your shadow never grow less martha thank you she shakes his proffered hand heartily bigelow and now ill collect my flock and go home curtis so long big be sure you dont mislay one of your heirs bigelow no fear but they might mislay me he goes curt sits down on couch martha goes to the window right and looks out after a pause waving her hand martha there they go what darlings they are curtis grunts perfunctorily martha comes back and sits beside curt on the couch with a sigh whoever did say it was right curt i am getting old curtis taking one of her hands and patting it nonsense martha shaking her head and smiling with a touch of sadness no i feel it curtis puts his arms around her protectingly nonsense youre not the sort that ever grows old martha nestling up to him im afraid were all that sort dear even you she touches the white hair about his temples playfully circumstantial evidence ill have to dye it when youre asleep some time and then nobodyll know curtis looking at her you havent any silver threads jokingly am i to suspect martha no i dont honest cross my heart i wouldnt even conceal that from you if i did but gray hairs prove nothing i am actually older than you dont forget curtis one whole year thats frightful isnt it martha im a woman remember so that one means at least six ugh lets not talk about it do you know it really fills me with a queer panic sometimes curtis squeezing her silly girl martha snuggling close to him will you always love me even when im old and ugly and feeble and youre still young and strong and handsome curtis kisses her tenderly martha what a foolish question sweetheart if we ever have to grow old well do it together just as weve always done everything martha with a happy sigh thats my dream of happiness curt enthusiastically oh it has been a wonderful strange life weve lived together curt hasnt it youre sure youve never regretted never had the weest doubt that it might have been better with someone else curtis kisses her again tenderly reproachful martha martha and i have helped really helped you havent i curtis much moved youve been the best wife a man could ever wish for martha youve been you are wonderful i owe everything to you your sympathy and encouragement dont you know i realize that she kisses him gratefully martha musing happily yes its been a wonderful glorious life id live it over again if i could every single second of it even the terrible suffering the children curtis wincing dont i wouldnt want that over again then changing the subject abruptly but why have you been putting all our life into the past tense it seems to me the most interesting part is still ahead of us martha softly i mean together curt curtis so do i martha but youre going away and i cant go with you this time curtis smiling to himself over her head yes that does complicate matters doesnt it martha hurt looking up at him curt how indifferently you say that as if you didnt care curtis avoiding her eyes teasingly what do you think youll do all the time im gone martha oh ill be lost dead i wont know what to do ill die of loneliness yearning creeping into her voice unless curtis inquisitively unless what martha burying her face on his shoulder passionately oh curt i love you so swear that youll always love me no matter what i do no matter what i ask curtis vaguely uneasy now trying to peer into her face but sweetheart martha giving way weakly to her feelings for a moment entreatingly then dont go curtis astonished why ive got to go you know that martha yes i suppose you have vigorously as if flinging off a weakness of course you have curtis but martha you said youd be lonely unless unless what martha unless i she hesitates blushing and confused i mean we oh im so afraid of what youll hold me close very close to you and ill whisper it she pulls his head down and whispers in his ear a look of disappointment and aversion forces itself on his face curtis almost indignantly but thats impossible martha martha pleadingly now dont be angry with me curt not till youve heard everything with a trace of defiance it isnt impossible curt its so its happened i was saving it as a secret to tell you today on my birthday curtis stunned you mean it is a fact martha yes then pitifully oh curt dont look that way you seem so cold so far away from me straining her arms about him why dont you hold me close to you why dont you say youre glad for my sake curtis agitatedly but martha you dont understand how can i pretend gladness when vehemently why it would spoil all our plans martha plans our plans what do you mean curtis excitedly why youre going with me of course ive obtained official permission ive been working for it for months the letter came yesterday morning martha stunned permission to go with you curtis excitedly yes i couldnt conceive going without you and i knew how you must be wishing martha in pain oh curtis distractedly jumping to his feet and staring at her bewilderedly martha you dont mean to tell me you werent martha in a crushed voice i was wishing you would finally decide not to go to stay at home curtis betraying exasperation but you must realize thats impossible martha are you sure youve clearly understood what ive told you you can go with me do you hear everything is arranged and ive had to fight so hard i was running the risk of losing my own chance by my insistence that i couldnt go without you martha weakly and helplessly i understand all that curt curtis indignantly and yet you hesitate why this is the greatest thing of its kind ever attempted there are unprecedented possibilities a whole new world of knowledge may be opened up the very origin of man himself and you will be the only woman martha i realize all that curt curtis you cant and hesitate and then think martha it will mean that you and i wont have to be separated we can go on living the old free life together martha growing calm now you are forgetting what i told you curt you must face the fact i cannot go curtis overwhelmed by the finality of her tone after a pause how long have you known this martha two months about curtis but why didnt you tell me before martha i was afraid you wouldnt understand and you havent curt but why didnt you tell me before what you were planning curtis eagerly you mean then you would have been glad to go before this had happened martha i would have accepted it curtis despairingly martha how could you ever have allowed this to happen oh i suppose im talking foolishness it wasnt your seeking i know martha yes it was curt i wished it i sought it curtis indignantly martha then in a hurt tone you have broken the promise we made when they died we were to keep their memories inviolate they were to be always our only children martha gently they forgive me curt and you will forgive me too when you see him and love him curtis him martha i know it will be a boy curtis sinking down on the couch beside her dully martha you have blown my world to bits martha taking one of his hands in hers gently you must make allowances for me curt and forgive me i am getting old no its the truth ive reached the turning point will you listen to my side of it curt and try to see it with sympathy with true understanding with a trace of bitterness forgetting your work for the moment curtis miserably thats unfair martha i think of it as our work and i have always believed you did too martha quickly i did curt i do all in the past is our work its my greatest pride to think so but curt ill have to confess frankly during the past two years ive felt myself feeling as if i wasnt complete with that alone curtis martha bitterly and all the time i believed that more and more it was becoming the aim of your life too martha with a sad smile im glad of that dear i tried my best to conceal it from you it would have been so unfair to let you guess while we were still in harness but oh how i kept looking forward to the time when we would come back and rest in our own home you know you said that was your plan to stay here and write your books and i was hoping curtis with a gesture of aversion i loathe this bookwriting it isnt my part i realize now but when i made the plans you speak of how could i know that then martha decisively youve got to go i wont try to stop you ill help all in my power as ive always done only i cant go with you any more and you must help me to do my work by understanding it he is silent frowning his face agitated preoccupied she goes on intensely oh curt i wish i could tell you what i feel make you feel with me the longing for a child if you had just the tiniest bit of feminine in you forcing a smile but youre so utterly masculine dear thats what has made me love you i suppose so ive no right to complain of it intensely i dont i wouldnt have you changed one bit i love you and i love the things you love your work because its a part of you and thats what i want you to do to reciprocate to love the creator in me to desire that i too should complete myself with the thing nearest my heart curtis intensely preoccupied with his own struggle vaguely but i thought martha i know but after all your work is yours not mine i have been only a helper a good comrade too i hope but somehow outside of it all do you remember two years ago when we were camped in yunnan among the aboriginal tribes it was one night there when we were lying out in our sleepingbags up in the mountains along the tibetan frontier i couldnt sleep suddenly i felt oh so tired utterly alone out of harmony with you with the earth under me i became horribly despondent like an outcast who suddenly realizes the whole world is alien and all the wandering about the world and all the romance and excitement id enjoyed in it appeared an aimless futile business chasing around in a circle in an effort to avoid touching reality forgive me curt i meant myself not you of course oh it was horrible i tell you to feel that way i tried to laugh at myself to fight it off but it stayed and grew worse it seemed as if i were the only creature alive who was not alive and all at once the picture came of a tribeswoman who stood looking at us in a little mountain village as we rode by she was nursing her child her eyes were so curiously sure of herself she was horribly ugly poor woman and yet as the picture came back to me i appeared to myself the ugly one while she was beautiful and i thought of our children who had died and such a longing for another child came to me that i began sobbing you were asleep you didnt hear she pauses then proceeds slowly and when we came back here to have a home at last i was so happy because i saw my chance of fulfillment before it was too late in a gentle pleading voice now can you understand dear she puts her hand on his arm curtis starting as if awaking from a sleep understand no i cant understand martha martha in a gasp of unbearable hurt curt i dont believe you heard a word i was saying curtis bursting forth as if releasing all the pentup struggle that has been gathering within him no i cant understand i cannot cannot it seems like treachery to me martha curt curtis ive depended on you this is the crucial point the biggest thing of my life and you desert me martha resentment gathering in her eyes if you had listened to me if you had even tried to feel curtis i feel that you are deliberately ruining my highest hope how can i go on without you ive been trying to imagine myself alone i cant even with my work who can i get to take your place oh martha why do you have to bring this new element into our lives at this late day havent we been sufficient you and i together isnt that a more difficult beautiful happiness to achieve than children everyone has children dont i love you as much as any man could love a woman isnt that enough for you doesnt it mean anything to you that i need you so terribly for myself for my work for everything that is best and worthiest in me can you expect me to be glad when you propose to introduce a stranger who will steal away your love your interest who will separate us and deprive me of you no no i cannot its asking the impossible i am only human martha if you were human you would think of my life as well as yours curtis i do it is our life i am fighting for not mine our life that you want to destroy martha our life seems to mean your life to you curt and only your life i have devoted fifteen years to that now i must fight for my own curtis aghast you talk as if we were enemies martha striding forward and seizing her in his arms no you dont mean it i love you so martha youve made yourself part of my life my work i need you so i cant share you with anyone i wont martha my own say that you wont dear he kisses her passionately again and again martha all her love and tenderness aroused by his kisses and passionate sincerity weakening curt curt pitiably it wont separate us dear cant you see he will be a link between us even when we are away from each other that he will bring us together all the closer curtis but i cant be away from you martha miserably oh curt why wont you look the fact in the face and learn to accept it with joy why cant you for my sake i would do that for you curtis breaking away from her passionately you will not do what i have implored you for me and i am looking the fact in the face the fact that there must be no fact avoiding her eyes as if defying his own finer feelings there are doctors who martha shrinking back from him curt you propose that to me with overwhelming sorrow oh curt when i feel him his life within me like a budding of my deepest soul to flower and continue me you say what you have just said griefstricken oh you never never never will understand curtis shamefacedly martha i distractedly i dont know what im saying this whole situation is so unbearable why why does it have to happen now martha gently it must be now or not at all at my age dear then after a pause staring at him frightenedly sadly you have changed curt i remember it used to be your happiness to sacrifice yourself for me curtis i had no work then no purpose beyond myself to sacrifice oneself is easy but when your only meaning becomes as a searcher for knowledge you cannot sacrifice that martha you must sacrifice everything for that or lose all sincerity martha i wonder where your work leaves off and you begin hasnt your work become you curtis yes and no helplessly you cant understand martha martha nor you curtis with a trace of bitter irony and you and your work arent they one and the same martha so you think mine is selfish too after a pause sadly i cant blame you curt its all my fault ive spoiled you by giving up my life so completely to yours youve forgotten i have one oh i dont mean that i was a martyr i know that in you alone lay my happiness and fulfillment in those years after the children died but we are no longer what we were then we must both of us relearn to love and respect what we have become curtis violently nonsense you talk as if love were an intellectual process taking her into his arms passionately i love you always and forever you are me and i am you what use is all this vivisecting he kisses her fiercely they look into each others eyes for a second then instinctively fall back from one another martha in a whisper yes you love me but who am i there is no recognition in your eyes you dont know curtis frightenedly martha stop this is terrible they continue to be held by each others fearfully questioning eyes the curtain falls act iii scene same as act ii as the curtain rises jayson is discovered sitting in an armchair by the fireplace in which a log fire is burning fitfully he is staring into the flames a strained expectant expression on his face it is about three oclock in the morning there is no light but that furnished by the fire which fills the room with shifting shadows the door in the rear is opened and richard appears his face harried by the stress of unusual emotion through the opened doorway a low muffled moan of anguish sounds from the upper part of the house jayson and richard both shudder the latter closes the door behind him quickly as if anxious to shut out the noise jayson looking up anxiously well richard involuntarily straightening up as if about to salute and report to a superior officer no change sir then as if remembering himself comes to the fireplace and slumps down in a chair agitatedly god dad i cant stand her moaning and screaming its got my nerves shot to pieces i thought i was hardened ive heard them out in no mans land dying by inches when you couldnt get to them or help but this is worse a million times after all that was war and they were men jayson martha is having an exceptionally hard ordeal richard since three oclock this morning yesterday morning i should say its a wonder she isnt dead jayson after a pause where is curt richard harshly still out in the garden walking around bareheaded in the cold like a lunatic jayson why didnt you make him come in richard make him its easy to say hes in a queer state dad i can tell you theres something torturing him besides her pain jayson after a pause yes theres a lot in all this we dont know about richard i suppose the reason hes so down on the family is because weve rather cut her since that tea affair jayson he shouldnt blame us she acted abominably and has certainly caused enough talk since then always about with bigelow richard with a sardonic laugh and yet he keeps asking everyone to send for bigelow says he wants to talk to him not us we cant understand he laughs bitterly jayson im afraid curt knows we understand too much agitatedly but why does he want bigelow in gods name in his present state with the suspicions he must have theres liable to be a frightful scene richard dont be afraid of a scene with pitying scorn the hell of it is he seems to regard bigelow as his best friend damned if i can make it out jayson i gave orders that they were always to tell curt bigelow was out of town and couldnt be reached with a sigh what a frightful situation for all of us after a pause it may sound cruel of me but i cant help wishing for all our sakes that this child will never richard yes dad i know what youre thinking it would be the best thing for it too although i hate myself for saying it there is a pause then the door in rear is opened and lily appears she is pale and agitated leaving the door open behind her she comes forward and flings herself on the lounge jayson anxiously well lily irritably getting up and switching on the lights isnt everything gloomy enough sits down i couldnt bear it upstairs one second longer esther and emily are coming down too its too much for them and theyve had personal experience trying to mask her agitation by a pretense at flippancy i hereby become a lifemember of the birthcontrol league lets let humanity cease if god cant manage its continuance any better than that richard seriously second the motion jayson peevishly youre young idiots keep your blasphemous nonsense to yourself lily lily jumping up and stamping her foot hysterically i cant stand it take me home dick wont you were doing no good waiting here ill have a fit or something if i stay richard glad of the excuse to go himself briskly thats how i feel ill drive you home come along esther and emily enter followed by john lily excitedly ill never marry or have a child never never ill go into marks office tomorrow and make myself independent of marriage esther sssh lily dont you know youre shouting and what silly talk lily ill show you whether its silly ill richard impatiently are you coming or not lily quickly yes wait here i am she pushes past the others and follows richard out rear esther and emily sit on couch john on chair right rear esther with a sigh i thought i went through something when mine were born but this is too awful emily and according to john curt actually says he hates it isnt that terrible after a pause meaningly its almost as if her suffering was a punishment dont you think esther if it is shes being punished enough heaven knows it cant go on this way much longer or something dreadful will happen emily do you think the baby esther i dont know i shouldnt say it but perhaps it would be better if emily thats what i think esther oh i wish i didnt have such evil suspicions but the way curt goes on how can you help feeling theres something wrong jayson suddenly how is curt emily john just came in from the garden turning around to where john is dozing in his chair sharply john well i never if he isnt falling asleep john he jerks up his head and stares at her blinking stupidly she continues irritably a nice time to pick out for a nap i must say john surlily dont forget i have to be at the bank in the morning jayson testily i have to be at the bank too and you dont notice me sleeping tell me about curt you just left him didnt you john irritably yes and ive been walking around that damned garden half the night watching over him isnt that enough to wear anyone out i can feel ive got a terrible cold coming on esther impatiently for goodness sake dont you start to pity yourself john indignantly im not i think ive showed my willingness to do everything i could if curt was only the least bit grateful he isnt he hates us all and wishes we were out of his home i would have left long ago if i didnt want to do my part in saving the family name from disgrace jayson impatiently has he quieted down thats what i want to know john harshly not the least bit hes out of his head and id be out of mine if a child was being born to my wife that jayson angrily keep that to yourself remember you have no proof morosely think all you want but dont talk emily pettishly the whole town knows it anyway im sure they must jayson theres only been gossip no real scandal lets do our united best to keep it at that after a pause wheres aunt elizabeth well have to keep an eye on her too or shes quite liable to blurt out the whole business before all comers esther you neednt be afraid shes forgotten all about the scandalous part no word of it has come to her out in the country and she hasnt set foot in town since that unfortunate tea remember and at present shes so busy wishing the child will be a boy that she hasnt a thought for another thing the door in the rear is opened and mark sheffield enters he comes up to the fire to warm himself the others watch him in silence for a moment jayson impatiently well mark wheres curt sheffield frowning inside i think hell be with us in a minute with a scornful smile just now hes phoning to bigelow the others gasp jayson furiously for gods sake couldnt you stop him sheffield not without a scene your aunt persuaded him to come into the house and he rushed for the phone i think he guessed we had been lying to him jayson after a pause then he bigelow will be here soon sheffield drily it depends on his sense of decency as he seems lacking in that quality ive no doubt hell come john rising to his feet pompously then i for one will go come emily since curt seems bound to disgrace everyone concerned i want it thoroughly understood that we wash our hands of the whole disgraceful affair emily snappishly go if you want to i wont then with a sacrificing air i think it is our duty to stay jayson exasperated sit down wash your hands indeed arent you as much concerned as any of us sheffield sharply sshh i think i hear curt now john sits down abruptly all stiffen into stony attitudes the door is opened and curt enters he is incredibly drawn and haggard a tortured bewildered expression in his eyes his hair is dishevelled his boots caked with mud he stands at the door staring from one to the other of his family with a wild contemptuous scorn and mutters curtis liars well hes coming now then bewilderedly why didnt you want him to come eh hes my oldest friend ive got to talk to someone and i cant to you wildly what do you want here anyway why dont you go a scream of marthas is heard through the doorway curt shudders violently slams the door to with a crash putting his shoulders against it as if to bar out the sound inexorably in anguish god why must she go through such agony why why he goes to the fireplace as mark makes way for him flings himself exhaustedly on a chair his shoulders bowed his face hidden in his hands the others stare at him pityingly there is a long silence then the two women whisper together get up and tiptoe out of the room motioning for the others to follow them john does so sheffield starts to go then notices the preoccupied jayson who is staring moodily into the fire sheffield sstt as jayson looks up in a whisper lets go out and leave him alone perhaps hell sleep jayson starting to follow sheffield hesitates and puts a hand on his sons shoulder curt remember im your father cant you confide in me ill do anything to help curtis harshly no dad leave me alone jayson piqued as you wish he starts to go curtis and send big in to me as soon as he comes jayson stops appears about to object then remarks coldly very well if you insist he switches off the lights he hesitates at the door uncertainly then opens it and goes out there is a pause then curt lifts his head and peers about the room seeing he is alone he springs to his feet and begins to pace back and forth his teeth clenched his features working convulsively then as if attracted by an irresistible impulse he goes to the closed door and puts his ear to the crack he evidently hears his wifes moans for he starts away in agony curtis oh martha martha martha darling he flings himself in the chair by the fireplace hides his face in his hands and sobs bitterly there is a ring from somewhere in the house soon after there is a knock at the door curtis doesnt hear at first but when it is repeated he mutters huskily come in bigelow enters curt looks up at him close that door big for gods sake bigelow does so then taking off his overcoat hat and throwing them on the lounge comes quickly over to curt i got over as soon as i could as he sees curts face he starts and says sympathetically by jove old man you look as though youd been through hell curtis grimly i have i am bigelow slapping his back buck up then anxiously hows martha curtis shes in hell too bigelow attempting consolation youre surely not worrying are you martha is so strong and healthy theres no doubt of her pulling through in fine shape curtis she should never have attempted this after a pause ive a grudge against you big it was you bringing your children over here that first planted this in her mind bigelow after a pause ive guessed you thought that thats why you havent noticed me or them over here so much lately ill confess that i felt you angrily and the infernal gossip ill admit i thought that you oh damn this rotten town anyway curtis impatiently oh for gods sake bitterly i didnt want you here to discuss bridgetown gossip bigelow i know old man forgive me in spite of the closed door one of marthas agonized moans is heard they both shudder curtis in a dead monotonous tone she has been moaning like that hour after hour i shall have those sounds in my ears until the day i die nothing can ever make me forget nothing bigelow trying to distract him deuce take it curt whats the matter with you i never thought youd turn morbid curtis darkly ive changed big i hardly know myself any more bigelow once youre back on the job again youll be all right youre still determined to go on this expedition arent you curtis yes i was supposed to join them this week in new york but ive arranged to catch up with them in china as soon as its possible for us to go bigelow us you mean you still plan to take curtis angrily aggressive yes certainly why not martha ought to be able to travel in a month or so bigelow yes but do you think it would be safe to take the child curtis with a bitter laugh yes i was forgetting the child wasnt i viciously but perhaps then catching himself with a groan oh damn all children big bigelow astonished curt curtis in anguish i cant help it ive fought against it but its there deep down in me and i cant drive it out i cant bigelow bewildered what curt curtis hatred yes hatred whats the use of denying it i must tell someone and youre the only one who might understand with a wild laugh for you hated your wife didnt you bigelow stunned good god you dont mean you hate martha curtis raging hate martha how dare you you fool i love martha love her with every miserable drop of blood in me with all my life all my soul she is my whole world everything hate martha god man have you gone crazy to say such a mad thing savagely no i hate it it bigelow shocked curt dont you know you cant talk like that now when curtis harshly it has made us both suffer torments not only now every day every hour for months and months why shouldnt i hate it eh bigelow staring at his friends wild distorted face with growing horror curt cant you realize how horrible curtis yes its horrible ive told myself that a million times with emphasis but its true bigelow severely shut up youre not yourself come think for a moment what would martha feel if she heard you going on this way why it would kill her curtis with a sobbing groan oh i know i know after a pause she read it in my eyes yes its horrible but when i saw her there suffering so frightfully i couldnt keep it out of my eyes i tried to force it back for her sake but i couldnt i was holding her hands and her eyes searched mine with such a longing question in them and she read only my hatred there not my love for her and she screamed and seemed to try to push me away i wanted to kneel down and pray for forgiveness to tell her it was only my love for her that i couldnt help it and then the doctors told me to leave and now the door is locked against me he sobs bigelow greatly moved this is only your damned imagination they put you out because you were in their way thats all and as for martha she was probably suffering so much curtis no she read it in my eyes i saw that look in hers of horror horror of me bigelow gruffly youre raving damn it curtis unheeding it came home to her then the undeniable truth with a groan isnt it fiendish that i should be the one to add to her torture in spite of myself in spite of all my will to conceal it she will never forgive me never and how can i forgive myself bigelow distractedly for gods sake dont think about it its absurd ridiculous curtis growing more calm in a tone of obsession shes guessed it ever since that day when we quarreled her birthday oh you can have no idea of the misery there has been in our lives since then you havent seen or guessed the reason no one has it has been the thought of it bigelow curt curtis unheeding for years we had welded our lives together so that we two were sufficient each to each there was no room for a third and it was a fine free life we had made a life of new worlds of discovery of knowledge invaluable to mankind isnt such a life worth all the sacrifice it must entail bigelow but that life was your life curt curtis vehemently no it was her life too her work as well as mine she had made the life our life the work our work had she the right to repudiate what she had built because she suddenly has a fancy for a home children a miserable ease i had thought i was her home her children i had tried to make my life worthy of being that to her and i had failed i was not enough bigelow curt curtis oh i tried to become reconciled i tried my damnedest i tried to love this child as i had loved those that died but i couldnt and so this being estranged us we loved as intensely as ever but it pushed us apart i grew to dread the idea of this intruder she saw this in me i denied it but she knew there was something in each of us the other grew to hate and still we loved as never before perhaps for we grew to pity each others helplessness bigelow curt are you sure you ought to tell anyone this curtis waving his remark aside one day when i was trying to imagine myself without her and finding nothing but hopelessness yet knowing i must go a thought suddenly struck me a horrible but fascinating possibility that had never occurred to me before with feverish intensity can you guess what it was bigelow no and i think youve done enough morbid raving if you ask me curtis the thought that came to me was that if a certain thing happened martha could still go with me and i knew if it did happen that she would want to go that she would fling herself into the spirit of our work to forget that she would be mine more than ever bigelow afraid to believe the obvious answer curt curtis yes my thought was that the child might be born dead bigelow repelled sternly damn it man do you know what youre saying relentingly no curt old boy do stop talking if you dont ill send for a doctor damned if i wont that talk belongs in an asylum god man cant you realize this is your child yours as well as hers curtis ive tried i cannot there is some inexorable force in me bigelow coldly do you realize how contemptible this confession makes you out angrily why if you had one trace of human kindness in you one bit of unselfish love for your wife one particle of pity for her suffering curtis anguished i have all the love and pity in the world for her thats why i cant help hating the cause of her suffering bigelow have you never thought that you might repay martha for giving up all her life to you by devoting the rest of yours to her curtis bitterly she can be happy without me she will have this child to take my place intensely you think i would not give up my work for her but i would i will stay here do anything she wishes if only we can make a new beginning again together alone bigelow agitated curt for gods sake dont return to that why good god man even now while youre speaking dont you realize what may be happening and you can talk as if you were wishing curtis fiercely i cant help but wish it bigelow distractedly for the love of god if you have such thoughts keep them to yourself i wont listen you make me despise life curtis and would you have me love life the door in the rear is opened and jayson enters pale and unnerved a succession of quick piercing shrieks is heard before he can close the door behind him shuddering my god my god with a fierce cry will this never end jayson tremblingly shhh they say this is the crisis puts his arm around curt bear up my boy it will soon be over now he sits down in the chair bigelow has vacated pointedly ignoring the latter the door is opened again and emily esther john and sheffield file in quickly as if escaping from the cries of the woman upstairs they are all greatly agitated curt groans pressing his clenched fists against his ears the two women sit on the lounge mark comes forward and stands by jaysons chair john sits by the door as before bigelow retreats behind curts chair aware of their hostility there is a long pause esther suddenly she has stopped they all listen jayson huskily thank god its over at last the door is opened and mrs davidson enters the old lady is radiant weeping tears of joy mrs davidson calls out exultantly between sobs a son curt a son with rapt fervor falling on her knees let us all give thanks to god curtis in a horrible cry of rage and anguish no no you lie they all cry out in fright and amazement curt the door is opened and the nurse appears nurse looking at curtis in a low voice mr jayson your wife is asking for you bigelow promptly slapping curt on the back there what did i tell you run you chump curtis with a gasp of joy martha darling im coming he rushes out after the nurse bigelow comes forward to get his hat and coat from the sofa coldly pardon me please they shrink away from him emily as he goes to the door cuttingly some people seem to have no sense of decency bigelow stung stops at the door and looks from one to the other of them bitingly no i quite agree with you he goes out shutting the door they all gasp angrily john scoundrel jayson testily going to mrs d who is still on her knees praying do get up aunt elizabeth how ridiculous what a scene if anyone should see you like that he raises her to her feet and leads her to a chair by the fire she obeys unresistingly seemingly unaware of what she is doing esther unable to restrain her jealousy so its a boy emily did you hear curt how he yelled out no its plain as the nose on your face he didnt want esther how awful john well can you blame him emily and the awful cheek of that bigelow person coming here esther they appeared as friendly as ever when we came in john scornfully curt is a blind simpleton and that man is a dyedinthewool scoundrel jayson frightenedly shhh suppose we were overheard emily when curt leaves we can put her in her proper place ill soon let her know she hasnt fooled me for one while she is speaking mrs d has gotten up and is going silently toward the door jayson testily aunt elizabeth where are you going mrs d tenderly i must see him again the dear she goes out esther devoured by curiosity hesitatingly i think i come on emily lets go up and see emily not i i never want to lay eyes on it john nor i esther i was only thinking everyone will think it funny if we dont jayson hastily yes yes we must keep up appearances getting to his feet yes i think we had better all go up make some sort of inquiry about martha you know its expected of us and they are all standing hesitating when the door in the rear is opened and the nurse appears supporting curt the latter is like a corpse his face is petrified with grief his body seems limp and halfparalyzed nurse her eyes flashing indignantly its a wonder some of you wouldnt come up here help me take him cant you ive got to run back jayson and sheffield spring forward and lead curt to a chair by the fire jayson anxious curt curt my boy what is it son emily catching the nurse as she tries to go nurse what is the matter nurse slowly his wife is dead they are all still stunned she lived just long enough to recognize him emily and the baby nurse with a professional air oh its a fine healthy baby eleven pounds thats what made it so difficult she goes the others all stand in silence esther suddenly sinking on the couch and bursting into tears oh im so sorry i said or thought anything wrong about her forgive me martha sheffield honestly moved but unable to resist this opportunity for latin solemnly de mortuis nil nisi bonum jayson who has been giving all his attention to his son curt curt emily hadnt the doctor better jayson shhh he begins to recognize me curt curtis looking around him bewilderedly yes suddenly remembrance comes and a spasm of intolerable pain contracts his features he presses his hands to the side of his head and groans brokenly martha gone dead oh he appeals wildly to the others her eyes she knew me she smiled she whispered forgive me curt forgive her when it was i who should have said forgive me but before i could she he falters brokenly emily looking from one to the other meaningly as if this justified all their suspicions oh curtis a sudden triumph in his voice but she loved me again only me i saw it in her eyes she had forgotten it raging never let me see it never let it come near me it has murdered her springing to his feet i hate it from the bottom of my soul i will never see it never never i take my oath as his father takes his arm shaking him off let me go i am going back to her he strides out of the door in a frenzy of grief and rage they all stand transfixed looking at each other bewilderedly emily putting all her venomous gratification into one word well the curtain falls act iv scene same as act i it is afternoon of a fine day three days later motors are heard coming up the drive in front of the house there is the muffled sound of voices the maid is seen going along the hall to the front door then the family enter from the rear first come jayson and esther with mrs davidson then lily dick and sheffield then john and his wife all are dressed in mourning the only one who betrays any signs of sincere grief is mrs davidson the others all have a strained look irritated worried or merely gloomy they seem to be thinking the worst is yet to come jayson leading mrs d who is weeping softly to the chair at left of table fretfully please do sit down aunt she does so mechanically and do stop crying he sits down in front of table esther goes to couch where she is joined by emily mark goes over and stands in back of them dick and john sit at rear of table lily comes down front and walks about nervously she seems in a particularly fretful upset mood lily trying to conceal her feelings under a forced flippancy what ridiculous things funerals are anyway that stupid minister whining away through his nose why does the lord show such a partiality for men with adenoids i wonder jayson testily sshhh have you no respect for anything lily resentfully if i had id have lost it when i saw all of you pulling such long faces in the church where you knew you were under observation pah such hypocrisy and then to cap it all emily has to force out a few crocodile tears at the grave emily indignantly when i saw curt thats why i cried not for her jayson what a scene curt made i actually believe he wanted to throw himself into the grave dick you believe he wanted to why it was all mark and i could do to hold him wasnt it mark sheffield nods jayson intolerable i never expected hed turn violent like that hes seemed calm enough the past three days lily calm yes just like a corpse is calm jayson distractedly and now this perfectly mad idea of going away today to join that infernal expedition leaving that child on our hands the child he has never even looked at why its too monstrously flagrant hes deliberately flaunting this scandal in everyones face john firmly he must be brought to time sheffield yes we must talk to him quite openly if were forced to after all i guess he realizes the situation more keenly than any of us lily who has wandered to window on right you mean you think he believes well i dont and you had better be careful not to let him guess what you think pointing outside theres my proof there he is walking about with bigelow can you imagine curt doing that if he thought for a moment dick oh i guess curt isnt all fool he knows thats the very best way to keep people from suspecting esther indignantly but wouldnt you think that bigelow person its disgusting his sticking to curt like this sheffield well for one im becoming quite resigned to bigelows presence in the first place he seems to be the only one who can bring curt to reason then again i feel that it is to bigelows own interest to convince curt that he mustnt provoke an open scandal by running away without acknowledging this child lily suddenly bursting forth hysterically oh i hate you all of you i loathe your suspicions and i loathe myself because im beginning to be poisoned by them too emily really lily at this late hour after the way curt has acted and her last words when she was dying lily distractedly i know shut up havent you told it a million times already mrs davidson gets up and walks to the door rear she has been crying softly during this scene oblivious to the talk around her jayson testily aunt elizabeth where are you going as she doesnt answer but goes out into the hall esther go with her and see that she doesnt esther gets up with a jealous irritation shes only going up to see the baby shes simply forgotten everything else in the world lily indignantly she probably realizes what we are too mean to remember that the baby at least is innocent wait esther ill come with you jayson yes hurry she shouldnt be left alone esther and lily follow the old lady out rear dick after a pause impatiently well what next i dont see what good we are accomplishing may i run along he gets up restlessly as he is speaking and goes to the window jayson severely you will stay if you please theres to be no shirking on anyones part it may take all of us to induce curt sheffield i wouldnt worry bigelow is taking that job off our hands i imagine dick looking out of the window he certainly seems to be doing his damnedest with a sneer the stage missed a great actor in him jayson worriedly but if bigelow should fail sheffield then well succeed with a grim smile by god well have to jayson curt has already packed his trunks and had them taken down to the station told me he was leaving on the five oclock train sheffield but didnt you hint to him there was now this matter of the child to be considered in making his plans jayson lamely i started to he simply flared up at me with insane rage dick looking out the window say i believe theyre coming in jayson bigelow dick yes theyre both making for the front door sheffield i suggest we beat a retreat to curts study and wait there jayson yes lets do that come on all of you they all retire grumblingly but precipitately to the study closing the door behind them the front door is heard opening and a moment later curt and bigelow enter the room curts face is set in an expression of stony grief bigelow is flushed excited indignant bigelow as curt sinks down on the couch pleading indignantly curt damn it wake up are you made of stone has everything ive said gone in one ear and out the other i know its hell for me to torment you at this particular time but its your own incredibly unreasonable actions that force me to i know how terribly you must feel but damn it man postpone this going away face this situation like a man be reconciled to your child stay with him at least until you can make suitable arrangements curtis fixedly i will never see it never bigelow how can you keep repeating that with martha hardly cold in her grave i ask you again what would she think how would she feel if you would only consent to see this baby i know youd realize how damnably mad and cruel you are wont you just for a second curtis no then raging if i saw it id be tempted to then brokenly no more of that talk big ive heard enough ive reached the limit bigelow restraining his anger with difficulty coldly thats your final answer eh well im through ive done all i could if you want to play the brute to forget all that was most dear in the world to martha to go your own damn selfish way well theres nothing more to be said you will be punished for it believe me he takes a step toward the door and i i want you to understand that all friendship ceases between us from this day you are not the curt i thought i knew and i have nothing but a feeling of repulsion goodby he starts for the door curtis dully goodby big bigelow stops his features working with grief and looks back at his friend then suddenly goes back to him penitently curt forgive me i ought to know better this isnt you youll come to yourself when youve had time to think it over the memory of martha shell tell you what you must do he wrings curts hand goodby old scout curtis dully goodby bigelow hurries out rear curt sits in a dumb apathy for a while then groans heartbrokenly martha martha he springs to his feet distractedly the door of the study is slowly opened and sheffield peers out cautiously then comes into the room followed by the others they all take seats as before curt ignores them sheffield clearing his throat curt curtis suddenly what time is it do you know sheffield looking at his watch two minutes to four curtis impatiently still an hour more of this jayson clearing his throat curt before he starts what he intends to say there is the sound of voices from the hall esther and lily help in mrs davidson to her former chair the old ladys face is again transformed with joy esther joins emily on the couch lily sits in chair front right there is a long uncomfortable pause during which curt paces up and down mrs davidson suddenly murmuring aloud to herself happily hes such a dear i could stay watching him forever jayson testily sshhh aunt then clearing his throat again surely youre not still thinking of going on the five oclock train are you curt curtis yes sheffield drily then mr bigelow didnt persuade you curtis coldly and impatiently im not to be persuaded by big or anyone else and ill thank you not to talk any more about it they all stiffen resentfully at his tone jayson to curt in a pleading tone you mustnt be unreasonable curt after all we are your family your best friends in the world and we are only trying to help you curtis with nervous vehemence i dont want your help you will help me most by keeping silent emily with a meaning look at the others sneeringly yes no doubt esther sshhh emily jayson helplessly but you see curt sheffield with his best judicial air if youll all allow me to be the spokesman i think perhaps that i they all nod and signify their acquiescence well then will you listen to me curt this last somewhat impatiently as curt continues to pace eyes on the floor curtis without looking at him harshly yes im listening what else can i do when youve got me cornered say what you like and lets get this over sheffield first of all curt i hope it is needless for me to express how very deeply we all feel for you in your sorrow but we sincerely trust that you are aware of our heartfelt sympathy they all nod a bitter cynical smile comes over lilys face esther suddenly breaking down and beginning to weep poor martha sheffield glances at his wife impatient at this interruption the others also show their irritation emily pettishly esther for goodness sake curt hesitates stares at his sister frowningly as if judging her sincerity then bends down over her and kisses the top of her bowed head impulsively seems about to break down himself grits his teeth and forces it back glances around at the others defiantly and resumes his pacing esther dries her eyes forcing a trembling smile the cry has done her good sheffield clearing his throat i may truthfully say we all feel as esther does even if we do not give vent with an air of sincere sympathy i know how terrible a day this must be for you curt we all do and we feel guilty in breaking in upon the sanctity of your sorrow in any way but if you will pardon my saying so your own course of action the suddenness of your plans have made it imperative that we come to an understanding about certain things about one thing in particular i might say he pauses curt goes on pacing back and forth as if he hadnt heard jayson placatingly yes it is for the best curt esther yes curt dear you mustnt be unreasonable dick feeling called upon to say something yes old man youve got to face things like a regular facts are facts this makes everybody uneasy lily springing to her feet phew its close in here im going out in the garden you can call me when these orations are finished she sweeps out scornfully jayson calling after her imperiously lily but she doesnt answer and he gives it up with a hopeless sigh curtis harshly what time is it sheffield you have plenty of time to listen to what i i should rather say we have to ask you curt i promise to be brief but first let me again impress upon you that i am talking in a spirit of the deepest friendliness and sympathy with you as a fellowmember of the same family i may say and with the highest ideals and the honor of that family always in view curt makes no comment sheffield unconsciously begins to adopt the alert keenness of the crossexaminer first let me ask you is it your intention to take that five oclock train today curtis harshly ive told you that sheffield and then youll join this expedition to asia curtis you know that sheffield to be gone five years curtis shrugging his shoulders more or less sheffield is it your intention to return here at any time before you leave for asia curtis no sheffield and your determination on these plans is irrevocable curtis irrevocable exactly please remember that sheffield sharply that being your attitude i will come bluntly to the core of the whole matter the child whose coming into the world cost martha her life curtis savagely her murderer you are right they all look shocked suspicious sheffield remonstratingly but suspiciously you can hardly hold the child responsible for the terrible outcome women die every day from the same cause keenly why do you attribute guilt to the child in this case curt curtis it lives and martha is gone but enough ive said i never wanted it mentioned to me will you please remember that sheffield sharply its name is jayson curt in the eyes of the law will you please remember that curtis distractedly i dont want to remember anything wildly please for gods sake leave me alone sheffield coldly i am sorry curt but you cannot act as if you were alone in this affair curtis why not am i not alone more alone this minute than any creature on gods earth sheffield soothingly in your great grief yes yes of course we all appreciate and we hate to persuasively yes it would be much wiser to postpone these practical considerations until you are in a calmer mood and if you will only give us the chance why not put off this precipitate departure for a month say and in the meantime curtis harshly i am going when i said i was i must get away from this horrible hole as far away as i can i must get back to my work for only in it will i find martha again but you you cant understand that what is the good of all this talking which leads nowhere sheffield coldly youre mistaken it leads to this do you understand that your running away from this child on the very day of its mothers funeral will have a very queer appearance in the eyes of the world emily and what are you going to do with the baby curt do you think you can run off regardless and leave it here on our hands curtis distractedly ill give it this home and someone anyone esther lily can appoint a nurse to live here and breaking down oh dont bother me sheffield sharply in the worlds eyes it will appear precious like a desertion on your part curtis oh arrange it to suit yourselves anything you wish sheffield quickly ill take you at your word then let us arrange it this way you will remain here a month longer at least curtis no sheffield ignoring the interruption you can make plans for the childs future in that time become reconciled to it curtis no jayson pleadingly curt please for all our sakes when the honor of the family is at stake dick yes old man theres that about it you know curtis no emily oh hes impossible sheffield perhaps curt misunderstood me meaningly be reconciled to it in the eyes of the public curt thats what i meant your own private feelings in the matter are no ones business but your own of course curtis bewilderedly but i dont see oh damn your eyes of the public emily breaking in its all very well for you to ignore what people in town think youll be in china or heaven knows where the scandal wont touch you but weve got to live here and have our position to consider curtis mystified scandal what scandal then with a harsh laugh oh you mean the imbecile busybodies will call me an unnatural father well let them i suppose i am but they dont know emily spitefully perhaps they know more than you think they do curtis turning on her sharply just what do you mean by that eh esther emily shhh jayson flurriedly be still emily let mark do the talking sheffield interposing placatingly what emily means is simply this curt you havent even been to look at this child since it has been born not once have you curtis no and i never intend sheffield insinuatingly and dont you suppose the doctors and nurses and the servants have noticed this it is not the usual procedure you must acknowledge and they wouldnt be human if they didnt think your action or lack of action peculiar and comment on it outside curtis well let them do you think i care a fiddlers curse how people judge me sheffield it is hardly a case of their judging you breaking off as he catches curts tortured eyes fixed on him wildly this is a small town curt and you know as well as i do gossip is not the least of its faults it doesnt take long for such things to get started persuasively now i ask you frankly is it wise to provoke deliberately what may easily be set at rest by a little ill be frank a little pretense on your part jayson yes my boy as a jayson i know you dont wish esthee with a sigh yes you really must think of us curt curtis in an acute state of muddled confusion but i you how are you concerned pretense you mean you want me to stay and pretend in order that you wont be disturbed by any silly tales they tell about me with a wild laugh good god this is too much why does a man have to be maddened by fools at such a time raging leave me alone youre like a swarm of poisonous flies jayson curt this is really when weve tried to be so considerate john bursting with rage its an outrage to allow such insults dick youre not playing the game curt emily spitefully it seems to me its much more for marthas sake were urging you than for our own after all the town cant say anything against us curtis turning on her marthas sake brokenly martha is gone leave her out of this sheffield sharply but unfortunately curt others will not leave her out of this they will pry and pry you know what they are and emily curt couldnt act the way he is doing if he ever really cared for her curtis you dare to say that then controlling himself a bit with scathing scorn what do know of love women like you you call your little rabbithutch emotions love your breadandbutter passions and you have the effrontery to judge emily shrinking from him frightenedly oh john john getting to his feet i protest i cannot allow even my own brother dick grabbing his arm keep your head old boy sheffield peremptorily you are making a fool of yourself curt and you are damned insulting in the bargain i think i may say that weve all about reached the end of our patience what emily said is for your own best interest if you had the sense to see it and i put it to you once and for all are you or are you not willing to act like a man of honor to protect your own good name the family name the name of this child and your wifes memory let me tell you your wifes good name is more endangered by your stubbornness than anything else curtis trembling with rage i i begin to think you all of you are aiming at something against martha in this yes in back of your words your actions i begin to feel raging go away get out of this house all of you oh i know your meanness ive seen how youve tried to hurt her ever since we came because you resented in your small minds her evident superiority emily scornfully superiority indeed curtis her breadth of mind and greatness of soul that you couldnt understand ive guessed all this and if i havent interfered its only because i knew she was too far above you to notice your sickening malice emily furiously youre only acting acting for our benefit because you think we dont curtis turning on her with annihilating contempt why you you poor little nonentity john struggles to get forward but dick holds him back emily insane with rage shrilly but we know and the whole town knows and you neednt pretend youve been blind youve given the whole thing away yourself the silly way youve acted telling everyone how you hated that baby letting everyone see jayson emily the others are all frightened try to interrupt her curt stares at her in a stunned bewilderment emily pouring forth all her venom regardless but you might as well leave off your idiotic pretending it doesnt fool us or anyone else your sending for bigelow that night your hobnobbing with him ever since your pretending hes as much your friend as ever theyre all afraid of you but im not i tell you to your face its all acting youre doing just cheap acting to try and pull the wool over our eyes until youve run away like a coward and left us to face the disgrace for you with this child on our hands esther trying to silence her excitedly emily keep still for heavens sake the others all utter exclamations of caution with fearful glances at curt emily becoming exhausted by her outburst more faintly well someone had to show him his place he thinks hes so superior to us just because telling us how much better she was than but i wont stand for that ive always had a clean name and always will and my children too thank god she sinks down on the couch exhausted panting but still glaring defiantly at curt curtis an awareness of her meaning gradually forcing itself on his mind bigelow big pretending hes as much my friend with a sudden gasp of sickened understanding oh he sways as if he were about to fall shrinking away from emily all horror oh you you youfilth john his fists clenched tries to advance on his brother how dare you insult my wife he is restrained held bake by his remonstrating father and dick mrs davidson as if suddenly coming out of a dream frightenedly what is the matter why is john mad at curt curtis his hands over his eyes acting like a person stricken with a sudden attack of nausea weakly so thats what has been in your minds oh this is bestial disgusting and there is nothing to be done i feel defenseless one would have to be as low as you are she would have been defenseless too it is better she is dead he stares about him wildly and you think you all think esther pityingly curt dear we dont think anything except what youve made us think with your crazy carryingon curtis looking from one to the other of them yes all of you its on your faces his eyes fix themselves on his aunt no you dont you dont mrs davidson i dont what curtis my how sick you look poor boy curtis you dont believe this child mrs davidson hes the sweetest baby i ever saw proudly and jayson right to the tips of his toes curtis ah i know you looking around at the others with loathing and hatred but look at them with a burst of fierce determination wait ill give you the only answer he dashes for the door in rear shakes off his father and dick who try to stop him and then is heard bounding up the stairs in hall dick runs after him jayson as far as the doorway esther gives a stifled scream there is a tense pause then dick reappears dick its all right i saw him go in jayson frightenedly but good god hes liable why didnt you follow him dick the doctor and nurse are there they would have called out wouldnt they if mrs davidson getting angrier and angrier as her puzzlement has grown greater in a stern tone i understand less and less of this where has curtis gone why did he act so sick what is the matter with all of you esther nothing aunt dear nothing mrs davidson no youll not hush me up accusingly you all look guilty have you been saying anything against curtis baby that was what curtis seemed to think a fine time youve picked out with his wife not cold in her grave jayson aunt mrs davidson i never liked that woman i never understood her but now now i love her and beg her forgiveness she died like a true woman in the performance of her duty she died gloriously and i will always respect her memory suddenly flying into a passion i feel that you are all hostile to her baby poor little defenseless creature yes youd hate the idea of curtis having a son you and your girls well ill make you bitterly regret the day you she plumps herself down in her chair again staring stubbornly and angrily before her emily spitefully i fear it will be necessary to tell aunt jayson sshh you have made enough trouble with your telling already miserably it should never have come to this pass curt will never forgive us never esther resentfully to emily see what not holding your tongue has done and my children will have to suffer for it too sheffield severely if emily had permitted me to conduct this business uninterruptedly this would never have occurred emily thats right all pick on me cowards she breaks down and sobs dick from the doorway coming back into the room sstt here he comes curtis reenters there is a look of strange exultation on his face he looks from one to the other of them he stammers well my answer to you your rotten world i kissed him he is mine he looked at me it was as if martha looked at me through his eyes esther voicing the general relief joyfully oh curt you wont go now youll stay curtis staring at her then from one to another of the rest with a withering scorn ha now you think you have conquered do you no im not going to stay do you think your vile slander could influence me to give up my work and neither shall you influence the life of my son i leave him here i must but not to your tender mercies no no thank god there still remains one jayson with unmuddled integrity to whom i can appeal he goes to mrs davidson i will leave him in your care aunt while i am gone mrs davidson delighted it will be a great happiness he will be the one god never granted me her lips trembling god has answered my prayer at last curtis i thank you aunt kisses her reverentially mrs davidson pleased but morally bound to grumble at him but i cannot approve of your running away like this it isnt natural then with selfish haste fearing her words may change his mind and she will lose the baby but you always were a queer person and a man must do faithfully the work ordained for him curtis gladly yes i must go what would i be for him or anyone if i stayed thank god you understand but i will come back the light of an ideal beginning to shine in his eyes when he is old enough i will teach him to know and love a big free life martha used to say that he would take her part in time my goal shall be his goal too martha shall live again for me in him and you aunt swear to keep him with you out there in the country never to let him know this obscene little world he indicates his relatives mrs davidson yes i promise curtis let anyone dare she glares about her the noise of a motor is heard from the drive it stops in front of the house curtis i must go he kisses his aunt teach him his mother was the most beautiful soul that ever lived goodby aunt mrs davidson goodby curtis without looking at the others he starts for the door rear they all break out into consciencestricken protestations jayson miserably curt youre not leaving us that way esther curt youre going without a word they all say this practically together and crowd toward him john and emily remain sullenly apart curt turns to face them lily enters from the rear youre not going curt curtis turning to her yes goodby lily he kisses her you loved her didnt you you are not like take my advice and get away before you become he has been staring into her face suddenly he pushes her brusquely away from him coldly but i see in your face its too late lily miserably no curt i swear curtis facing them all defiantly yes i am going without a word because i cannot find the fitting one be thankful i cant it would shrivel up your souls like flame he again turns and strides to the door jayson his grief overcoming him my boy we are wrong we know but at least say you forgive us curtis wavers with his back towards them then turns and forces the words out ask forgiveness of her she yes she was so fine i feel she so you are forgiven goodby he goes the motor is heard driving off there is a tense pause lily then he did find out oh a fine mess youve made of everything but no i should say we shouldnt i curt guessed that oh i hate you and myself she breaks down there is a strained pause during which they are all silent their eyes avoiding each other fixed in dull stupid stares finally dick fidgets uncomfortably heaves a noisy sigh and blurts out with an attempt at comforting reassurance dick well it isnt as bad as it might have been anyway he did acknowledge the kid before witnesses too jayson testily keep your remarks to yourself if you please but most of his family are already beginning to look relieved the curtain falls
