the emperor jones the emperor jones eugene oneil scene one the audience chamber in the palace of the emperor a spacious highceilinged room with bare whitewashed walls the floor is of white tiles in the rear to the left of center a wide archway giving out on a portico with white pillars the palace is evidently situated on high ground for beyond the portico nothing can be seen but a vista of distant hills their summits crowned with thick groves of palm trees in the right wall center a smaller arched doorway leading to the living quarters of the palace the room is bare of furniture with the exception of one huge chair made of uncut wood which stands at center its back to rear this is very apparently the emperors throne it is painted a dazzling eyesmiting scarlet there is a brilliant orange cushion on the seat and another smaller one is placed on the floor to serve as a footstool strips of matting dyed scarlet lead from the foot of the throne to the two entrances it is late afternoon but the sunlight still blazes yellowly beyond the portico and there is an oppressive burden of exhausting heat in the air as the curtain rises a native negro woman sneaks in cautiously from the entrance on the right she is very old dressed in cheap calico barefooted a red bandana handkerchief covering all but a few stray wisps of white hair a bundle bound in colored cloth is carried over her shoulder on a stick she hesitates beside the doorway peering back as if in extreme dread of being discovered then she begins to glide noiselessly a step at a time toward the doorway in the rear at this moment smithers appears beneath the portico smithers is a tall stoopshouldered man about forty his bald head perched on a long neck with an enormous adams apple looks like an egg the tropics have tanned his naturally pasty face with its small sharp features to a sickly yellow and native rum has painted his pointed nose to a startling red his little washyblue eyes are redrimmed and dart about him like a ferrets his expression is one of unscrupulous meanness cowardly and dangerous he is dressed in a worn riding suit of dirty white drill puttees spurs and wears a white cork helmet a cartridge belt with an automatic revolver is around his waist he carries a riding whip in his hand he sees the woman and stops to watch her suspiciously then making up his mind he steps quickly on tiptoe into the room the woman looking back over her shoulder continually does not see him until it is too late when she does smithers springs forward and grabs her firmly by the shoulder she struggles to get away fiercely but silently smithers tightening his grasp roughly easy none o that me birdie you cant wriggle out now i got me ooks on yer woman seeing the uselessness of struggling

reaching for his revolver stop or ill shoot then stopping indifferently pop orf then if yer like yer black cow he stands in the doorway looking after her jones enters from the right he is a tall powerfullybuilt fullblooded negro of middle age his features are typically negroid yet there is something decidedly distinctive about his face an underlying strength of will a hardy selfreliant confidence in himself that inspires respect his eyes are alive with a keen cunning intelligence in manner he is shrewd suspicious evasive he wears a light blue uniform coat sprayed with brass buttons heavy gold chevrons on his shoulders gold braid on the collar cuffs etc his pants are bright red with a light blue stripe down the side patent leather laced boots with brass spurs and a belt with a longbarreled pearlhandled revolver in a holster complete his makeup yet there is something not altogether ridiculous about his grandeur he has a way of carrying it off jones not seeing anyone greatly

scarlet as the throne he rings this vigorously then stops to listen then he goes to both doors rings again and looks out smithers watching him with malicious satisfaction after a pause mockingly the bloody ship is sinkin an the bleedin rats as slung their ooks jones in a sudden fit of anger flings the bell clattering into a corner lowflung woods niggers then catching smithers eye on him he

accelerated rate from this point uninterruptedly to the very end of the play jones starts at the sound a strange look of apprehension creeps into his face for a moment as he listens then he asks with an attempt to regain his most casual manner whats dat drum beatin fo smithers with a mean grin for you that means the bleedin ceremony as started ive eard it before and i knows jones cermony what

nigger puttin an is bloody airs i opes they nabs im an gives im whats what curtain к scene two the end of the plain where the great forest begins the foreground is sandy level ground dotted by a few stones and clumps of stunted bushes cowering close against the earth to escape the buffeting of the trade wind in the rear the forest is a wall of darkness dividing the world only when the eye becomes accustomed to the gloom can the outlines of separate trunks of the nearest trees be made out enormous pillars of deeper blackness a somber monotone of wind lost in the leaves moans in the air yet this sound serves but to intensify the impression of the forests relentless immobility to form a background throwing into relief its brooding implacable silence jones enters from the left walking rapidly he stops as he nears the edge of the forest looks around him quickly peering into the dark as if searching for some familiar landmark then apparently satisfied that he is where he ought to be he throws himself on the ground dogtired к well heah i is in de nick o time too little mo an itd be blackern de ace of spades heahabouts he pulls a bandana handkerchief from his hip pocket and mops off his perspiring face sho gimme air ise tuckered out sho nuff dat soft emperor job aint no trainin for a long hike ovah dat plain in de brilin sun then with a chuckle cheah up nigger de worst is yet to come he lifts his head and stares at the forest his chuckle peters out abruptly in a tone of awe my goodness look at dem woods will you dat nocount smithers said deyd be black an he sho called de turn turning away from them quickly and looking down at his feet he snatches at a chance to change the subject solicitously feet you is holdin up yo end fine an i sutinly hopes you aint blisterin none its time you git a rest he takes off his shoes his eyes studiously avoiding the forest he feels of the soles of his feet gingerly you is still in de pink ony a little mite feverish cool yoselfs remember you done got a long journey yit befo you he sits in a weary attitude listening to the rhythmic beating of the tomtom he grumbles in a loud tone to cover up a growing uneasiness bush niggers wonder dey wouldn git sick o beatin dat drum sound louder seem like i wonder if deys startin after me he scrambles to his feet looking back across the plain couldnt see dem now nohow if dey was hundred feet away then shaking himself like a wet dog to get rid of these depressing thoughts sho deys miles an miles behind what you gittin fidgetty about but he sits down and begins to lace up his shoes in great haste all the time muttering reassuringly you know what yo belly is empty dats whats de matter wid you come time to eat wid nothin but wind on yo stumach o course you feels jiggedy well we eats right heah an now soons i gits dese pesky shoes laced up he finishes lacing up his shoes dere now les see gets on his hands and knees and searches the ground around him with his eyes white stone white stone where is you he sees the first white stone and crawls to it with satisfaction heah you is i knowed dis was de right place box of grub come to me he turns over the stone and feels in under it in a tone of dismay aint heah gorry is i in de right place or isnt i deres nother stone guess dats it he scrambles to the next stone and turns it over aint heah neither grub whar is you aint heah gorry has i got to go hungry into dem woods all de night while he is talking he scrambles from one stone to another turning them over in frantic haste finally he jumps to his feet excitedly is i lost de place

gotta find dat grub high an low somehow why it come dark so quick like dat cant see nothin he scratches a match on his trousers and peers about him the rate of the beat of the faroff tomtom increases perceptibly as he does so he mutters in a bewildered voice how come all dese white stones come heah when i only remembers one suddenly with a frightened gasp he flings the match on the ground and stamps on it nigger is you gone crazy mad is you lightin matches to show dem whar you is fo lawds sake use yo haid gorry ise got to be careful he stares at the plain behind him apprehensively his hand on his revolver but how come all dese white stones and whars dat tin box o grub i hid all wrapped up in oil cloth while his back is turned the little formless fears creep out from the deeper blackness of the forest they are black shapeless only their glittering little eyes can be seen if they have any describable form at all it is that of a grubworm about the size of a creeping child they move noiselessly but with deliberate painful effort striving to raise themselves on end failing and sinking prone again jones turns about to face the forest he stares up at the tops of the trees seeking vainly to discover his whereabouts by their conformation cant tell nothin from dem trees gorry nothin round heah look like i evah seed it befo ise done lost de place sho nuff with mournful foreboding its mighty queer its mighty queer with sudden forced defiance in an angry tone woods is you tryin to put somethin ovah on me from the formless creatures on the ground in front of him comes a tiny gale of low mocking laughter like a rustling of leaves they squirm upward toward him in twisted attitudes jones looks down leaps backward with a yell of terror yanking out his revolver as he does join a quavering voice whats dat whos dar what is you git away from me befo i shoots you up you dont he fires there is a flash a loud report then silence broken only by the faroff quickened throb of the tomtom the formless creatures have scurried back into the forest jones remains fixed in his position listening intently the sound of the shot the reassuring feel of the revolver in his hand have somewhat restored his shaken nerve he addresses himself with renewed confidence deyre gone dat shot fix em dey was only little animals little wild pigs i reckon deyve maybe rooted out yo grub an eat it sho you fool nigger what you think dey is hants excitedly gorry you give de game away when you fire dat shot dem niggers heah dat fo sutin time you beat it in de woods widout no long waits he starts for the forest hesitates before the plunge then urging himself in with manful resolution git in nigger what you skeered at aint nothin dere but de trees git in he plunges boldly into the forest scene three in the forest the moon has just risen its beams drifting through the canopy of leaves make a barely perceptible suffused eerie glow a dense low wall of underbrush and creepers is in the nearer foreground fencing in a small triangular clearing beyond this is the massed blackness of the forest like an encompassing barrier a path is dimly discerned leading down to the clearing from left rear and winding away from it again toward the right as the scene opens nothing can be distinctly made out except for the beating of the tomtom which is a trifle louder and quicker than in the previous scene there is silence broken every few seconds by a queer clicking sound then gradually the figure of the negro jeff can be discerned crouching on his haunches at the rear of the triangle he is middleaged thin brown in color is dressed in a pullman porters uniform cap etc he is throwing a pair of dice on the ground before him picking them up shaking them casting them out with the regular rigid mechanical movements of an automaton the heavy plodding footsteps of someone approaching along the trail from the left are heard and jones voice pitched in a slightly higher key and strained in a cheering effort to overcome its own tremors de moons rizen does you heah dat nigger you gits more light from dis out no mo buttin yo fool head agin de trunks an scratchin de hide off yo legs in de bushes now you sees whar yose gwine so cheer up from now on you has a snap he steps just to the rear of the triangular clearing and mops off his face on his sleeve he has lost his panama hat his face is scratched his brilliant uniform shows several large rents what times it gittin to be i wonder i dassent light no match to find out phoo its wam an dats a fac wearily how long r been makin tracks in dese woods must be hours an hours seems like foevah yit cant be when de moons jes riz dis am a long night fo yo yo majesty with a mournful chuckle majesty der aint much majesty bout dis baby now with

whistle but checks himself abruptly what yo whistlin for you po dope want all de won to heah you he stops talking to listen heah dat ole drum sho gits nearer from de sound deyre packin it along wid em time fo me to move he takes a step forward then stops worriedly whats dat odder queer clicketty sound i heah den it is sound close sound like sound like fo god sake sound like some nigger was shootin crap frightenedly i better beat it quick when i gits dem notions he walks quickly into the clear space then stands transfixed as he sees jeff in a terrified gasp who dar who dat is dat you jeff starting toward the other forgetful for a moment of his surroundings and really believing it is a living man that he sees in a tone of happy relief jeff ise sho mighty glad to see you dey tol me you done died from dat razor cut i gives you stopping suddenly bewilderedly but how you come to be heah nigger he stares fascinatedly at the other who continues his mechanical play with the dice jones eyes begin to roll wildly he stutters aint you gwine look up cant you speak to me is you is you a hant he jerks out his revolver in a frenzy of terrified rage nigger i kills you dead once has i got to kill you agin you take it den he fires when the smoke clears away jeff has disappeared jones stands trembling then with a certain reassurance hes gone anyway hant or no hant dat shot fix him the beat of the faroff tomtom is perceptibly louder and more rapid jones becomes conscious of it with a start looking back over his shoulder deys gittin near deyse comin fast and heah i is shootin shots to let em know jes whar i is oh gorry ise got to run forgetting the path he plunges wildly into the underbrush in the rear and disappears in the shadow scene four in the forest a wide dirt road runs diagonally from right front to left rear rising sheer on both sides the forest walls it in the moon is now up under its light the road glimmers ghastly and unreal it is as if the forest had stood aside momentarily to let the road pass through and accomplish its veiled purpose this done the forest will fold in upon itself again and the road will be no more jones stumbles in from the forest on the right his uniform is ragged and torn he looks about him with numbed surprise when he sees the road his eyes blinking in the bright moonlight he flops down exhaustedly and pants heavily for a while then with sudden anger im meltin wid heat runnin an runnin an runnin damn dis heah coat like a strait jacket he tears off his coat and flings it away from him revealing himself stripped to the waist den dats better now i kin breathe looking down at his feet the spurs catch his eye and to hell wid dese highfangled spurs deyre whats been atrippin me up an breakin my neck he unstraps them and flings them away disgustedly dere i gits rid o dem frippety emperor trappins an i travels lighter lawd ise tired after a pause listening to the insistent beat of the tomtom in the distance i must a put some

coast in de mawning den youse all safe from the right forward a small gang of negroes enter they are dressed in striped convict suits their heads are shaven one leg drags limpingly shackled to a heavy ball and chain some carry picks the others shovels they are followed by a white man dressed in the uniform of a prison guard a winchester rifle is slung across his shoulders and he carries a heavy whip at a signal from the guard they stop on the road opposite where jones is sitting jones who has been staring up at the sky unmindful of their noiseless approach suddenly looks down and sees them his eyes pop out he tries to get to his feet and fly but sinks back too numbed by fright to move his voice catches in a choking prayer lawd jesus the prison guard cracks his whip noiselessly andat that signal all the convicts start to work on the road they swing their picks they shovel but not a sound comes from their labor their movements like those of jeff in the preceding scene are those of automatons rigid slow and mechanical the prison guard points sternly at jones with his whip motions him to take his place among the other shovellers jones gets to his feet in a hypnotized stupor he mumbles subserviently yes suh yes suh ise comin as he shuffles dragging one foot over to his place he curses under his breath with rage and hatred god damn yo soul i gits even wid you yit sometime as if there were a shovel in his hands he goes through weary mechanical gestures of digging up dirt and throwing it to the roadside suddenly the guard approaches him angrily threateningly he raises his whip and lashes jones viciously across the shoulders with it jones winces with pain and cowers abjectly the guard turns his back on him and walks away contemptuously instantly jones straightens up with arms upraised as if his shovel were a club in his hands he springs murderously at the unsuspecting guard in the act of crashing down his shovel on the white mans skull jones suddenly becomes aware that his hands are empty he cries despairingly whars my shovel gimme my shovel till i splits his damn head appealing to his fellow convicts gimme a shovel one o you fo gods sake they stand fixed in motionless attitudes their eyes on the ground the guard seems to wait expectantly his back turned to the attacker jones bellows with baffled terrified rage tugging frantically at his revolver i kills you you white debil if its de last thing i evah does ghost or debil i kill you agin he frees the revolver and fires point blank at the guards back instantly the walls of the forest close in from both sides the road and the figures of the convict gang are blotted out in an enshrouding darkness the only sounds are a crashing in the underbrush as jones leaps away in mad flight and the throbbing of the tomtom still far distant but increased in volume of sound and rapidity of beat scene five a large circular clearing enclosed by the serried ranks of gigantic trunks of tall trees whose tops are lost to view in the center is a big dead stump worn by time into a curious resemblance to an auction block the moon floods the clearing with a clear light jones forces his way in through the forest on the left he looks wildly about the clearing with hunted fearful glances his pants are in tatters his shoes cut and misshapen flapping about his feet he slinks cautiously to the stump in the center and sits down in a tense position ready for instant flight then he holds his head in his hands and rocks back and forth moaning to himself miserably oh lawd lawd oh lawd lawd suddenly he throws himself on his knees and raises his clasped hands to the sky in a voice of agonized pleading lawd jesus heah my prayer ise a po sinner a po sinner i knows i done wrong i knows it when i cotches jeff cheatin wid loaded dice my anger overcomes me and i kills him dead lawd i done wrong when dat guard hits me wid de whip my anger overcomes me and i kills him dead lawd i done wrong and down heah whar dese fool bush niggers raises me up to the seat o de mighty i steals all i could grab lawd i done wrong i knows it ise sorry forgive me lawd forgive dis po sinner then beseeching terrifiedly and keep dem away lawd keep dem away from me and stop dat drum soundin in my ears dat begin to sound hanted too he gets to his feet evidently slightly reassured by his prayer with attempted confidence de lawdll preserve me from dem hants after dis sits down on the stump again i aint skeered o real men let dem come but dem odders he shudders then looks down at his feet working his toes inside the shoe with a groan oh my po feet dem shoes aint no use no more ceptin to hurt ise better off widout dem he unlaces them and pulls them off holds the wrecks of the shoes in his hands and regards them mournfully you was real aone patin leather too look at you now emperor youse gittin mighty low he sighs dejectedly and remains with bowed shoulders staring down at the shoes in his hands as if reluctant to throw them away while his attention is thus occupied a crowd of figures silently enter the clearing from all sides all are dressed in southern costumes of the period of the fifties of the last century there are middleaged who are evidently welltodo planters there is one spruce authoritative individual the auctioneer there are a crowd of curious spectators chiefly young belles and dandies who have come to the slavemarket for diversion all exchange courtly greetings in dumb show and chat silently together there is something stiff rigid unreal marionettish about their movements they group themselves about the stump finally a batch of slaves are led in from the left by an attendant three men of different ages two women one with a baby in her arms nursing they are placed to the left of the stump beside jones the white planters look them over appraisingly as if they were cattle and exchange judgments on each the dandies point with their fingers and make witty remarks the belles titter bewitchingly all this in silence save for the ominous throb of the tomtom the auctioneer holds up his hand taking his place at the stump the groups strain forward attentively he touches jones on the shoulder peremptorily motioning for him to stand on the stump the auction block jones looks up sees the figures on all sides looks wildly for some opening to escape sees none screams and leaps madly to the top of the stump to get as far away from them as possible he stands there cowering paralyzed with horror the auctioneer begins his silent spiel he points to jones appeals to the planters to see for themselves here is a good field hand sound in wind and limb as they can see very strong still in spite of being middleaged look at that back look at those shoulders look at the muscles in his arms and his sturdy legs capable of any amount of hard labor moreover of a good disposition intelligent and tractable will any gentleman start the bidding the planters raise their fingers make their bids they are apparently all eager to possess jones the bidding is lively the crowd interested while this has been going on jones has been seized by the courage of desperation he dares to look down and around him over his face abject terror gives way to mystification to gradual realization stutteringly what you all doin white folks whats all dis what you all lookin at me fo what you doin wid me anyhow suddenly convulsed with raging hatred and fear is dis a auction is you sellin me like dey uster hefo de war jerking out his revolver just as the auctioneer knocks him down to one of the planters glaring from him to the purchaser and you sells me and you buys me i shows you ise a free nigger damn yo souls he fires at the auctioneer and at the planter with such rapidity that the two shots are almost simultaneous as if this were a signal the walls of the forest fold in only blackness remains and silence broken by jones as he rushes off crying with fear and by the quickened ever louder beat of the tomtom scene six a cleared space in the forest the limbs of the trees meet over it forming a low ceiling about five feet from the ground the interlocked ropes of creepers reaching upward to entwine the tree trunks gives an arched appearance to the sides the space thus encloses it like the dark noisome hold of some ancient vessel the moonlight is almost completely shut out and only a vague wan light filters through there is the noise of someone approaching from the left stumbling and crawling through the undergrowth jones voice is heard between chattering moans oh lawd what i gwine do now aint got no bullet left ony de silver one if mo o dem hants come after me how i gwine skeer dem away oh lawd onj de silver one left an i gotta save dat fo luck if i shoots dat one im a goner sho i lawd its black heah whars de moon oh lawd dont dis night evah come to an end by the sounds he is feeling his way cautiously forward dere dis feels like a clear space i gotta lie down an rest i dont care if dem niggers does cotch me i gotta rest he is well forward now where his figure can be dimly made out his pants have been so torn away that what is left of them is no better than a breech cloth he flings himself full length face downward on the ground panting with exhaustion gradually it seems to grow lighter in the enclosed space and two rows of seated figures can be seen behind jones they are sitting in crumpled despairing attitudes hunched facing one another with their backs touching the forest walls as if they were shackled to them all are negroes naked save for loin cloths at first they are silent and motionless then they begin to sway slowly forward toward each and back again in unison as if they were laxly letting themselves follow the long roll of a ship at sea at the same time a low melancholy murmur rises among them increasing gradually by rhythmic degrees which seem to be directed and controlled by the throb of the tomtom in the distance to a long tremulous wail of despair that reaches a certain pitch unbearably acute then falls by slow graduations of tone into silence and is taken up again jones starts looks up sees the figures and throws himself down again to shut out the sight a shudder of terror shakes his whole body as the wail rises up about him again but the next time his voice as if under some uncanny compulsion starts with the others as their chorus lifts he rises to a sitting posture similar to the others swaying back and forth his voice reaches the highest pitch of sorrow of desolation the light fades out the other voices cease and only darkness is left jones can be heard scrambling to his feet and running off his voice sinking down the scale and receding as he moves farther and farther away in the forest the tomtom beats louder quicker with a more insistent triumphant pulsation scene seven the foot of a gigantic tree by the edge of a great river a rough structure of boulders like an altar is by the tree the raised river bank is in the nearer background beyond this the surface of the river spreads out brilliant and unruffled in the moonlight blotted out and merged into a veil of bluish mist in the distance jones voice is heard from the left rising and falling in the long despairing wail of the chained slaves to the rhythmic beat of the tomtom as his voice sinks into silence he enters the open space the expression on his face is fixed and stony his eyes have an obsessed glare he moves with a strange deliberation like a sleepwalker or one in a trance he looks around at the tree the rough stone altar the moonlit surface of the river beyond and passes his hand over his head with a vague gesture of puzzled bewilderment then as if in obedience to some obscure impulse he sinks into a kneeling devotional posture before the altar then he seems to come to himself partly to have an uncertain realization of what he is doing for he straightens up and stares about him horrifiedly in an incoherent mumble к what what is i doin what is dis place seems like seems like i know dat tree an dem stones an de river i remember seems like i been heah befo tremblingly oh gorry ise skeered in dis place ise skeered oh lawd pertect dis sinner crawling away from the altar he cowers close to the ground his face hidden his shoulders heaving with sobs of hysterical fright from behind the trunk of the tree as if he had sprung out of it the figure of the congo witchdoctor appears he is wizened and old naked except for the fur of some small animal tied about his waist its bushy tail hanging down in front his body is stained all over a bright red antelope horns are on each side of his head branching upward in one hand he carries a bone rattle in the other a charm stick with a bunch of white cockatoo feathers tied to the end a great number of glass beads and bone ornaments are about his neck ears wrists and ankles he struts noiselessly with a queer prancing step to a position in the clear ground between jones and the altar then with a preliminary summoning stamp of his foot on the earth he begins to dance and to chant as if in response to his summons the beating of the tomtom grows to a fierce exultant boom whose throbs seem to fill the air with vibrating rhythm jones looks up starts to spring to his feet reaches a half kneeling halfsquatting position and remains rigidly fixed there paralyzed with awed fascination by this new apparition the witchdoctor sways stamping with his foot his bone rattle clicking the time his voice rises and falls in a weird monotonous croon without articulate word divisions gradually his dance becomes clearly one of a narrative in pantomime his croon is an incantation a charm to allay the fierceness of some implacable deity demanding sacrifice he flees he is pursued by devils he hides he flees again ever wilder and wilder becomes his flight nearer and nearer draws the pursuing evil more and more the spirit of terror gains possession of him his croon rising to intensity is punctuated by shrill cries jones has become completely hypnotized his voice joins in the incantation in the cries he beats time with his hands and sways his body to and fro from the waist the whole spirit and meaning of the dance has entered into him has become his spirit finally the theme of the pantomime halts on a howl of despair and is taken up again in a note of savage hope there is a salvation the forces of evil demand sacrifice they must be appeased the witchdoctor points with his wand to the sacred tree to the river beyond to the altar and finally to jones with a ferocious command jones seems to sense the meaning of this it is he who must offer himself for sacrifice he beats his forehead abjectly to the ground moaning hysterically mercy oh lawd mercy mercy on dis po sinner the witchdoctor springs to the river bank he stretches out his arms and calls to some god within its depths then he starts backward slowly his arms remaining out a huge head of a crocodile appears over the bank and its eves glittering greenly fasten upon jones he stares into them fascinatedly the witchdoctor prances up to him touches him with his wand motions with hideous command toward the waiting monster jones squirms on his belly nearer and nearer moaning continually mercy lawd mercy the crocodile heaves more of his enormous hulk onto the land jones squirms toward him the witchdoctors voice shrills out in furious exultation the tomtom beats madly jones cries out in a fierce exhausted spasm of anguished pleading lawd save me lawd jesus hear my prayer immediately in answer to his prayer comes the thought of the one bullet left him he snatches at his hip shouting defiantly de silver bullet you dont git me yit he fires at the green eyes in front of him the head of the crocodile sinks back behind the river bank the witchdoctor springs behind the sacred tree and disappears jones lies with his face to the ground his arms outstretched whimpering with fear as the throb of the tomtom fills the silence about him with a somber pulsation a baffled but revengeful power scene eight dawn same as scene two the dividing line of forest and plain the nearest tree trunks are dimly revealed but the forest behind them is still a mass of glooming shadow the tomtom seems on the very spot so loud and continuously vibrating are its beats lem enters from the left followed by a small squad of his soldiers and by the cockney trader smithers lem is a heavyset apefaced old savage of the extreme african type dressed only in a loin cloth a revolver and cartridge belt are about his waist his soldiers are in different degrees of ragconcealed nakedness all wear broad palm leaf hats each one carries a rifle smithers is the same as in scene one one of the soldiers evidently a tracker is peering about keenly on the ground he grunts and points to the spot where jones entered the forest lem and smithers come to look smithers after

aw garn es a better man than the lot o you put together i ates the sight o im but ill say that for im a sound of snapping twigs comes from the forest the soldiers jump to their feet cocking their rifles alertly lem remains sitting with an imperturbable expression but listening intently the sound from the woods is repeated lem makes a quick signal with his hand his followers creep quickly but noiselessly into the forest scattering so that each enters at a different spot smithers in the silence that follows a contemptuous whisper you aint thinkin that would be im i ope lem calmly we cotch
