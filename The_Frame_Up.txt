the frame up by richard harding davis when the voice over the telephone promised to name the man who killed hermann banf district attorney wharton was uptown lunching at delmonicos this was contrary to his custom and a concession to hamilton cutler his distinguished brotherinlaw that gentleman was interested in a state constabulary bill and had asked state senator bissell to father it he had suggested to the senator that in the legal points involved in the bill his brotherinlaw would undoubtedly be charmed to advise him so that morning to talk it over bissell had come from albany and as he was forced to return the same afternoon had asked wharton to lunch with him uptown near the station that in public life there breathed a man with soul so dead who were he offered a chance to serve hamilton cutler would not jump at the chance was outside the experience of the county chairman and in so judging his fellow men with the exception of one man the senator was right the one man was hamilton cutlers brotherinlaw in the national affairs of his party hamilton cutler was one of the four leaders in two cabinets he had held office at a foreign court as an ambassador his dinners of which the diplomatic corps still spoke with emotion had upheld the dignity of ninety million americans he was rich the history of his family was the history of the state when the albany boats drew abreast of the old cutler mansion on the cast bank of the hudson the passengers pointed at it with deference even when the search lights pointed at it it was with deference and on fifth avenue as the seeing new york car passed his town house it slowed respectfully to half speed when apparently for no other reason than that she was good and beautiful he had married the sister of a then unknown up state lawyer every one felt hamilton cutler had made his first mistake but like every thing else into which he entered for him matrimony also was a success the prettiest girl in utica showed herself worthy of her distinguished husband she had given him children as beautiful as herself as what washington calls a cabinet lady she had kept her name out of the newspapers as madame lambassatrice she had put archduchesses at their ease and after ten years she was an adoring wife a devoted mother and a proud woman her pride was in believing that for every joy she knew she was indebted entirely to her husband to owe everything to him to feel that through him the blessings flowed was her ideal of happiness in this ideal her brother did not share her delight in a sense of obligation left him quite cold no one better than himself knew that his rapidfire rise in public favor was due to his own exertions to the fact that he had worked very hard had been independent had kept his hands clean and had worn no mans collar other people believed he owed his advancement to his brotherinlaw he knew they believed that and it hurt him when at the annual dinner of the amen corner they burlesqued him as singing to ham cutler you made me what i am today i hope youre satisfied he found that to laugh with the others was something of an effort his was a difficult position he was a party man he had always worked inside the organization the fact that whenever he ran for an elective office the reformers indorsed him and the best elements in the opposition parties voted for him did not shake his loyalty to his own people and to hamilton cutler as one of his party leaders as one of the bosses of the invisible government he was willing to defer but while he could give allegiance to his party leaders and from them was willing to receive the rewards of office from a rich brotherinlaw he was not at all willing to accept anything still less was he willing that of the credit he deserved for years of hard work for the party of selfdenial and of efficient public service the rich brotherinlaw should rob him his pride was to be known as a selfmade man as the servant only of the voters and now that ambition now that he was district attorney of new york city to have it said that the office was the gift of his brotherinlaw was bitter but he believed the injustice would soon end in a month he was coming up for reelection and night and day was conducting a campaign that he hoped would result in a personal victory so complete as to banish the shadow of his brotherinlaw were he reelected by the majority on which he counted he would have the party leaders on their knees hamilton cutler would be forced to come to him he would be in line for promotion he knew the leaders did not want to promote him that they considered him too inclined to kick over the traces but were he now reelected at the next election either for mayor or governor he would be his partys obvious and legitimate candidate the reelection was not to be an easy victory outside his own party to prevent his succeeding himself as district attorney tammany hall was using every weapon in her armory the commissioner of police was a tammany man and in the public prints wharton had repeatedly declared that banf his star witness against the police had been killed by the police and that they had prevented the discovery of his murderer for this the wigwam wanted his scalp and to get it had raked his public and private life had used threats and bribes and with women had tried to trap him into a scandal but big tim meehan the lieutenant the hall had detailed to destroy wharton had reported back that for their purpose his record was useless that bribes and threats only flattered him and that the traps set for him he had smilingly sidestepped this was the situation a month before election day when to oblige his brotherinlaw wharton was uptown at delmonicos lunching with senator bissell downtown at the office rumson the assistant district attorney was on his way to lunch when the telephonegirl halted him her voice was lowered and betrayed almost human interest from the corner of her mouth she whispered this man has a note for mr wharton says if he dont get it quick itll be too late says it will tell him who killed heimie banf the young man and the girl looked at each other and smiled their experience had not tended to make them credulous had he lived hermann banf would have been for wharton the star witness against a ring of corrupt police officials in consequence his murder was more than the taking off of a shady and disreputable citizen it was a blow struck at the high office of the district attorney at the grand jury and the law but so far whoever struck the blow had escaped punishment and though for a month ceaselessly by night and day the office and the police had sought him he was still at large still unknown there had been hundreds of clews they had been furnished by the detectives of the city and county and of the private agencies by amateurs by newspapers by members of the underworld with a score to pay off or to gain favor but no clew had led anywhere when in hoarse whispers the last one had been confided to him by his detectives wharton had protested indignantly stop bringing me clews he exclaimed i want the man i cant electrocute a clew so when after all other efforts over the telephone a strange voice offered to deliver the murderer rumson was skeptical he motioned the girl to switch to the desk telephone assistant district attorney rumson speaking he said what can i do for you before the answer came as though the speaker were choosing his words there was a pause it lasted so long that rumson exclaimed sharply hello he called do you want to speak to me or do you want to speak to me ive gotta letter for the district attorney said the voice im to give it to nobody but him its about banf he must get it quick or itll be too late who are you demanded rumson where are you speaking from the man at the other end of the wire ignored the questions wherell wharton be for the next twenty minutes if i tell you parried rumson will you bring the letter at once the voice exclaimed indignantly bring nothing ill send it by district messenger youre wasting time trying to reach me its the letter you want it tells the voice broke with an oath and instantly began again i cant talk over a phone i tell you its life or death if you lose out its your own fault where can i find wharton at delmonicos answered rumson hell be there until two oclock delmonicos thats fortyfort street right said rumson tell the messenger he heard the receiver slam upon the hook with the light of the hunter in his eyes he turned to the girl they can laugh he cried but i believe weve hooked something im going after it in the waitingroom he found the detectives hewitt he ordered take the subway and whip up to delmonicos talk to the taxistarter till a messengerboy brings a letter for the d a let the boy deliver the note and then trail him till he reports to the man he got it from bring the man here if its a district messenger and he doesnt report but goes straight back to the office find out who gave him the note get his description then meet me at delmonicos rumson called up that restaurant and had wharton come to the phone he asked his chief to wait until a letter he believed to be of great importance was delivered to him he explained but of necessity somewhat sketchily it sounds to me commented his chief like a plot of yours to get a lunch uptown invitation cried rumson ill be with you in ten minutes after rumson had joined wharton and bissell the note arrived it was brought to the restaurant by a messengerboy who said that in answer to a call from a saloon on sixth avenue he had received it from a young man in readytowear clothes and a green hat when hewitt the detective asked what the young man looked like the boy said he looked like a young man in readytowear clothes and a green hat but when the note was read the identity of the man who delivered it ceased to be of importance the paper on which it was written was without stamped address or monogram and carried with it the mixed odors of the drugstore at which it had been purchased the handwriting was that of a woman and what she had written was if the district attorney will come at once and alone to kesslers cafe on the boston post road near the city line he will be told who killed hermann banf if he dont come in an hour it will be too late if he brings anybody with him he wont be told anything leave your car in the road and walk up the drive ida earle hewitt who had sent away the messengerboy and had been called in to give expert advice was enthusiastic mr district attorney he cried thats no crank letter this earle woman is wise you got to take her as a serious proposition she wouldnt make that play if she couldnt get away with it who is she asked wharton to the police the detective assured them ida earle had been known for years when she was young she had been under the protection of a man high in the ranks of tammany and in consequence with her different ventures the police had never interfered she now was proprietress of the roadhouse in the note described as kesslers cafe it was a place for joyriders there was a cabaret a hall for public dancing and rooms for very private suppers in so far as it welcomed only those who could spend money it was exclusive but in all other respects its reputation was of the worst in situation it was lonely and from other houses separated by a quarter of a mile of dying trees and vacant lots the boston post road upon which it faced was the old post road but lately through this back yard and dumpingground of the city had been relaid it was patrolled only and infrequently by bicycle policemen but this continued the detective eagerly is where we win out the roadhouse is an old farmhouse built over with the barns changed into garages they stand on the edge of a wood its about as big as a city block if we come in through the woods from the rear the garages will hide us nobody in the house can see us but we wont be a hundred yards away youve only to blow a police whistle and well be with you you mean i ought to go said wharton rumson exclaimed incredulously you got to go it looks to me objected bissell like a plot to get you there alone and rap you on the head not with that note inviting him there protested hewitt and signed by earle herself you dont know she signed it objected the senator i know her returned the detective i know shes no fool its her place and she wouldnt let them pull off any rough stuff there not against the d a anyway the d a was rereading the note might this be it he asked suppose its a trick to mix me up in a scandal you say the place is disreputable suppose theyre planning to compromise me just before election theyve tried it already several times youve still got the note if persisted hewitt it proves why you went there and the senator too he can testify and we wont be hundred yards away and he added grudgingly you have nolan nolan was the spoiled child of the office he was the district attorneys pet although still young he had scored as a detective and as a driver of racingcars as whartons chauffeur he now doubled the parts what nolan testified wouldnt be any help said wharton they would say it was just a story he invented to save me then square yourself this way urged rumson send a note now by hand to ham cutler and one to your sister tell them youre going to ida earles and why tell them youre afraid its a frameup and for them to keep your notes as evidence and enclose the one from her wharton nodded in approval and while he wrote rumson and the detective planned how without those inside the roadhouse being aware of their presence they might be near it kesslers cafe lay in the seventyninth police precinct in taxicabs they arranged to start at once and proceed down white plains avenue which parallels the boston road until they were on a line with kesslers but from it hidden by the woods and the garages a walk of a quarter of a mile across lots and under cover of the trees would bring them to within a hundred yards of the house wharton was to give them a start of half an hour that he might know they were on watch they agreed after they dismissed the taxicabs to send one of them into the boston post road past the roadhouse when it was directly in front of the cafe the chauffeur would throw away into the road an empty cigarettecase from the cigarstand they selected a cigarette box of a startling yellow at half a mile it was conspicuous when you see this in the road explained rumson youll know were on the job and after youre inside if you need us youve only to go to a rear window and wave if they mean to do him up growled bissell he wont get to a rear window he can always tell them were outside said rumsonand they are extremely likely to believe him do you want a gun no said the d a better have mine urged hewitt i have my own explained the d a rumson and hewitt set off in taxicabs and a halfhour later wharton followed as he sank back against the cushions of the big touringcar he felt a pleasing thrill of excitement and as he passed the traffic police and they saluted mechanically he smiled had they guessed his errand their interest in his progress would have been less perfunctory in half an hour he might know that the police killed banf in half an hour he himself might walk into a trap they had in turn staged for him as the car ran swiftly through the clean october air and the wind and sun alternately chilled and warmed his blood wharton considered these possibilities he could not believe the woman earle would lend herself to any plot to do him bodily harm she was a responsible person in her own world she was as important a figure as was the district attorney in his her allies were the man higher up in tammany and the police of the upper ranks of the uniformed force and of the higher office of the district attorney she possessed an intimate and respectful knowledge it was not to be considered that against the prosecuting attorney such a woman would wage war so the thought that upon his person any assault was meditated wharton dismissed as unintelligent that it was upon his reputation the attack was planned seemed much more probable but that contingency he had foreseen and so he believed forestalled there then remained only the possibility that the offer in the letter was genuine it seemed quite too good to be true for as he asked himself on the very eve of an election why should tammany or a friend of tammany place in his possession the information that to the tammany candidate would bring inevitable defeat he felt that the way they were playing into his hands was too open too generous if their object was to lead him into a trap of all baits they might use the promise to tell him who killed banf was the one certain to attract him it made their invitation to walk into the parlor almost too obvious but were the offer not genuine there was a condition attached to it that puzzled him it was not the condition that stipulated he should come alone his experience had taught him many will confess or betray to the district attorney who to a deputy will tell nothing the condition that puzzled him was the one that insisted he should come at once or it would be too late why was haste so imperative why if he delayed would he be too late was the man he sought about to escape from his jurisdiction was he dying and was it his wish to make a deathbed confession or was he so reluctant to speak that delay might cause him to reconsider and remain silent with these questions in his mind the minutes quickly passed and it was with a thrill of excitement wharton saw that nolan had left the zoological gardens on the right and turned into the boston road it had but lately been completed and to wharton was unfamiliar on either side of the unscarred roadway still lay scattered the uprooted trees and boulders that had blocked its progress and abandoned by the contractors were empty tarbarrels cementsacks toolsheds and forges nor was the surrounding landscape less raw and unlovely toward the sound stretched vacant lots covered with ash heaps to the left a few old and broken houses set among the glasscovered cold frames of truckfarms the district attorney felt a sudden twinge of loneliness and when an automobile sign told him he was miles from columbus circle he felt that from the new york he knew he was much farther two miles up the road his car overhauled a bicycle policeman and wharton halted him is there a roadhouse called kesslers beyond here he asked on the left farther up the officer told him and added you cant miss it mr wharton theres no other house near it you know me said the da then youll understand what i want you to do ive agreed to go to that house alone if they see you pass they may think im not playing fair so stop here the man nodded and dismounted but added the district attorney as the car started forward again if you hear shots i dont care how fast you come the officer grinned better let me trail along now he called thats a tough joint but wharton motioned him back and when again he turned to look the man still stood where they had parted two minutes later an empty taxicab came swiftly toward him and as it passed the driver lifted his hand from the wheel and with his thumb motioned behind him thats one of the men said nolanthat started with mr rumson and hewitt from delmonicos wharton nodded and now assured that in their plan there had been no hitch smiled with satisfaction a moment later when ahead of them on the asphalt road nolan pointed out a spot of yellow he recognized the signal and knew that within call were friends the yellow cigarettebox lay directly in front of a long wooden building of two stories it was linked to the road by a curving driveway marked on either side by whitewashed stones on verandas enclosed in glass wharton saw whitecovered tables under red candleshade and protruding from one end of the house and hung with electric lights in paper lanterns a pavilion for dancing in the rear of the house stood sheds and a thick tangle of trees on which the autumn leaves showed yellow painted fingers and arrows pointing and an electric sign proclaimed to all who passed that this was kesslers in spite of its reputation the house wore the aspect of the commonplace in evidence nothing flaunted nothing threatened from a dozen other inns along the pelham parkway and the boston post road it was no way to be distinguished as directed in the note wharton left the car in the road for five minutes stay where yo are he ordered nolan then go to the bar and get a drink dont talk to any one or theyll think youre trying to get information work around to the back of the house stand where i can see you from the window i may want you to carry a message to mr rumson on foot wharton walked up the curved driveway and if from the house his approach was spied upon there was no evidence in the second story the blinds were drawn and on the first floor the verandas were empty nor not even after he had mounted to the veranda and stepped inside the house was there any sign that his visit was expected he stood in a hall and in front of him rose a broad flight of stairs that he guessed led to the private supperrooms on his left was the restaurant swept and garnished after the revels of the night previous and as though resting in preparation for those to come it an air of peaceful inactivity at a table a maitre dhotel was composing the menu for the evening against the walls three colored waiters lounged sleepily and on a platform at a piano a pale youth with drugged eyes was with one hand picking an accompaniment as wharton paused uncertainly the young man disdaining his audience in a shrill nasal tenor raised his voice and sang and from the time the rooster calls ill wear my overalls and you a simple gingham gown so if youre strong for a shower of rice we two could make a paradise of any onehorse town at sight of wharton the head waiter reluctantly detached himself from his menu and rose but before he could greet the visitor wharton heard his name spoken and looking up saw a woman descending the stairs it was apparent that when young she had been beautiful and in spite of an expression in her eyes of hardness and distrust which seemed habitual she was still handsome she was without a hat and wearing a house dress of decorous shades and in the extreme of fashion her black hair built up in artificial waves was heavy with brilliantine her hands covered deep with rings and of an unnatural white showed the most fastidious care but her complexion was her own and her skin free from paint and powder glowed with that healthy pink that is supposed to be the perquisite only of the simple life and a conscience undisturbed i am mrs earle said the woman i wrote you that note will you please come this way that she did not suppose he might not come that way was obvious for as she spoke she turned her back on him and mounted the stairs after an instant of hesitation wharton followed as well as his mind his body was now acutely alive and vigilant both physically and mentally he moved on tiptoe for whatever surprise for whatever ambush might lie in wait he was prepared at the top of the stairs he found a wide hall along which on both sides were many doors the one directly facing the stairs stood open at one side of this the woman halted and with a gesture of the jewelled fingers invited him to enter my sittingroom she said as wharton remained motionless she substituted my office peering into the room wharton found it suited to both titles he saw comfortable chairs vases filled with autumn leaves in silver frames photographs and between two open windows a businesslike rollertop desk on which was a hand telephone in plain sight through the windows he beheld the garage and behind it the tops of trees to summon rumson to keep in touch with nolan he need only step to one of these windows and beckon the strategic position of the room appealed and with a bow of the head he passed in front of his hostess and entered it he continued to take note of his surroundings he now saw that from the office in which he stood doors led to rooms adjoining these doors were shut and he determined swiftly that before the interview began he first must know what lay behind them mrs earle had followed and as she entered closed the door no said wharton it was the first time he had spoken for an instant the woman hesitated regarding him thoughtfully and then without resentment pulled the door open she came toward him swiftly and he was conscious of the rustle of silk and the stirring of perfumes at the open door she cast a frown of disapproval and then with her face close to his spoke hurriedly in a whisper a man brought a girl here to lunch she said theyve been here before the girl claims the man told her he was going to marry her last night she found out he has a wife already and she came here today meaning to make trouble she brought a gun they were in the room at the far end of the hall george the water heard the two shots and ran down here to get me no one else heard these rooms are fixed to keep out noise and the piano was going we broke in and found them on the floor the man was shot through the shoulder the girl through the body his story is that after she fired in trying to get the gun from her she shot herselfby accident thats right i guess but the girl says they came here to die together what the newspaper call a suicide pact because they couldnt marry and that he first shot her intending to kill her and then himself thats silly she framed it to get him she missed him with the gun so now shes trying to get him with this murder charge i know her if shed been sober she wouldnt have shot him shed have blackmailed him shes that sort i know her and with an exclamation the district attorney broke in upon her and the man he demanded eagerly was it he killed banf in amazement the woman stared certainly not she said then what has this to do with banf nothing her tone was annoyed reproachful that was only to bring you here his disappointment was so keen that it threatened to exhibit itself in anger recognizing this before he spoke wharton forced himself to pause then he repeated her words quietly bring me here he asked why the woman exclaimed impatiently so you could beat the police to it she whispered so you could hush it up the surprised laugh of the man was quite real it bore no resentment or pose he was genuinely amused then the dignity of his office tricked and insulted demanded to be heard he stared at her coldly his indignation was apparent you have done extremely ill he told her you know perfectly well you had no right to bring me up here to drag me into a row in your roadhouse hush it up he exclaimed hotly this time his laugh was contemptuous and threatening ill show you how ill hush it up he moved quickly to the open window stop commanded the woman you cant do that she ran to the door again he was conscious of the rustle of silk of the stirring of perfumes he heard the key turn in the lock it had come it was a frameup there would be a scandal and to save himself from it they would force him to hush up this other one but as to the outcome in no way was he concerned through the window standing directly below it he had seen nolan in the sunlit yard the chauffeur his cap on the back of his head his cigarette drooping from his lips was tossing the remnants of a sandwich to a circle of excited hens he presented a picture of bored indolence of innocent preoccupation it was almost too well done assured of a witness for the defense he greeted the woman with a smile why cant i do it he taunted she ran close to him and laid her hands on his arm her eyes were fixed steadily on his because she whispered the man who shot that girlis your brotherinlaw ham cutler for what seemed a long time wharton stood looking down into the eyes of the woman and the eyes never faltered later he recalled that in the sudden silence many noises disturbed the lazy hush of the indiansummer afternoon the rush of a motorcar on the boston road the tinkle of the piano and the voice of the youth with the drugged eyes singing and youll wear a simple gingham gown from the yard below the cluckcluck of the chickens and the cooing of pigeons his first thought was of his sister and of her children and of what this bomb hurled from the clouds would mean to her he thought of cutler at the height of his power and usefulness by this one disreputable act dragged into the mire of what disaster it might bring to the party to himself if as the woman invited he helped to hush it up and tammany learned the truth it would make short work of him it would say for the murderer of banf he had one law and for the rich brotherinlaw who had tried to kill the girl he deceived another but before he gave voice to his thoughts he recognized them as springing only from panic they were of a part with the acts of men driven by sudden fear and of which acts in their sane moments they would be incapable the shock of the womans words had unsettled his traditions not only was he condemning a man unheard but a man who though he might dislike him he had for years for his private virtues trusted and admired the panic passed and with a confident smile he shook his head i dont believe you he said quietly the manner of the woman was equally calm equally assured will you see her she asked id rather see my brotherinlaw he answered the woman handed him a card doctor muir took him to his private hospital she said i loaned them my car because its a limousine the address is on that card but she added both your brother and sammy thats sam muir the doctor asked you wouldnt use the telephone theyre afraid of a leak apparently wharton did not hear her as though it were exhibit a presented in evidence by the defense he was studying the card she had given him he stuck it in his pocket ill go to him at once he said to restrain or dissuade him the woman made no sudden move in level tones she said your brotherinlaw asked especially that you wouldnt do that until youd fixed it with the girl your face is too well known hes afraid some one might find out where he is and for a day or two no one must know that this doctor knows it retorted wharton the suggestion seemed to strike mrs earle as humorous for the first time she laughed sammy she exclaimed hes a lobbygow of mine hes worked for me for years i could send him up the river if i liked he knows it her tone was convincing they both asked she continued evenly you should keep off until the girl is out of the country and fixed wharton frowned thoughtfully and observing this the eyes of the woman showed that so far toward the unfortunate incident the attitude of the district attorney was to her most gratifying wharton ceased frowning how fixed he asked mrs earle shrugged her shoulders cutlers idea is money she said but believe me hes wrong this girl is a vampire shell only come back to you for more shell keep on threatening to tell the wife to tell the papers the way to fix her is to throw a scare into her and theres only one man can do that theres only one man that can hush this thing up thats you when can i see her asked wharton now said the woman ill bring her wharton could not suppress an involuntary here he exclaimed for the shade of a second mrs earle exhibited the slightest evidence of embarrassment my rooms in a mess she explained and shes not hurt so much as sammy said he told her she was in bad just to keep her quiet until you got here mrs earle opened one of the doors leading from the room i wont be a minute she said quietly she closed the door behind her upon her disappearance the manner of the district attorney underwent an abrupt change he ran softly to the door opposite the one through which mrs earle had passed and pulled it open but if beyond it he expected to find an audience of eavesdroppers he was disappointed the room was empty and bore no evidence of recent occupation he closed the door and from the rollertop desk snatching a piece of paper scribbled upon it hastily wrapping the paper around a coin and holding it exposed to view he showed himself at the window below him to an increasing circle of hens and pigeons nolan was still scattering crumbs without withdrawing his gaze from them the chauffeur nodded wharton opened his hand and the note fell into the yard behind him he heard the murmur of voices the sobs of a woman in pain and the rattle of a doorknob as from the window he turned quickly he saw that toward the spot where his note had fallen nolan was tossing the last remnants of his sandwich the girl who entered with mrs earle leaning on her and supported by her was tall and fair around her shoulders her blond hair hung in disorder and around her waist under the kimono mrs earle had thrown about her were wrapped many layers of bandages the girl moved unsteadily and sank into a chair in a hostile tone mrs earle addressed her rose she said this is the district attorney to him she added she calls herself rose gerard one hand the girl held close against her side with the other she brushed back the hair from her forehead from halfclosed eyes she stared at wharton defiantly well she challenged what about it wharton seated himself in front of the rollertop desk are you strong enough to tell me he asked his tone was kind and this the girl seemed to resent dont you worry she sneered im strong enough strong enough to tell all i know to you and to the papers and to a jury until i get justice she clinched her free hand and feebly shook it at him thats what im going to get she cried her voice breaking hysterically justice from behind the armchair in which the girl halfreclined mrs earle caught the eye of the district attorney and shrugged her shoulders just what did happen asked wharton apparently with an effort the girl pulled herself together i first met your brotherinlaw she began wharton interrupted quietly wait he said you are not talking to me as anybodys brotherinlaw but as the district attorney the girl laughed vindictively i dont wonder youre ashamed of him she jeered again she began i first met ham cutler last may he wanted to marry me then he told me he was not a married man as her story unfolded wharton did not again interrupt and speaking quickly in abrupt broken phrases the girl brought her narrative to the moment when as she claimed cutler had attempted to kill her at this point a knock at the locked door caused both the girl and her audience to start wharton looked at mrs earle inquiringly but she shook her head and with a look at him also of inquiry and of suspicion as well opened the door with apologies her head waiter presented a letter for mr wharton he explained from his chauffeur whartons annoyance at the interruption was most apparent what the devil he began he read the note rapidly and with a frown of irritation raised his eyes to mrs earle he wants to go to new rochelle for an inner tube he said how long would it take him to get there and back the hard and distrustful expression upon the face of mrs earle which was habitual was now most strongly in evidence her eyes searched those of wharton twenty minutes she said he cant go snapped wharton tell him he directed the waiter to stay where he is tell him i may want to go back to the office any minute he turned eagerly to the girl im sorry he said with impatience he crumpled the note into a ball and glanced about him at his feet was a wastepaper basket fixed upon him he saw while pretending not to see the eyes of mrs earle burning with suspicion if he destroyed the note he knew suspicion would become certainty without an instant of hesitation carelessly he tossed it intact into the wastepaper basket toward rose gerard he swung the revolving chair go on please he commanded the girl had now reached the climax of her story but the eyes of mrs earle betrayed the fact that her thoughts were elsewhere with an intense and hungry longing they were concentrated upon her own wastepaper basket the voice of the girl in anger and defiance recalled mrs earle to the business of the moment he tried to kill me shouted miss rose and his shooting himself in the shoulder was a bluff thats my story thats the story im going to tell the judge her voice soared shrilly thats the story thats going to send your brotherinlaw to sing sing for the first time mrs earle contributed to the general conversation you talk like a fish she said the girl turned upon her savagely if he dont like the way i talk she cried he can come across mrs earle exclaimed in horror virtuously her hands were raised in protest like hell he will she said you cant pull that under my roof wharton looked disturbed come across he asked come across mimicked the girl send me abroad and keep me there and ill swear it was an accident twentyfive thousand thats all i want cutler told me he was going to make you governor he cant make you governor if hes in sing sing can he aint it worth twentyfive thousand to you to be governor come on she jeered kick in with a grave but untroubled voice wharton addressed mrs earle may i use your telephone he asked he did not wait for her consent but from the desk lifted the hand telephone spring three one hundred he said he sat with his legs comfortably crossed the stand of the instrument balanced on his knee his eyes gazing meditatively at the yellow treetops if with apprehension both women started if the girl thrust herself forward and by the hand of mrs earle was dragged back he did not appear to know it police headquarters they heard him ask i want to speak to the commissioner this is the district attorney in the pause that followed as though to torment her the pain in her side apparently turned for the girl screamed sharply be still commanded the older woman breathless across the top of the armchair she was leaning forward upon the man at the telephone her eyes were fixed in fascination commissioner said the district attorney this is wharton speaking a woman has made a charge of attempted murder to me against my brotherinlaw hamilton cutler on account of our relationship i want you to make the arrest if there were any slip and he got away it might be said i arranged it you will find him at the winona apartments on the southern boulevard in the private hospital of a doctor samuel muir arrest them both the girl who makes

sorry he said but i had to do it you might have known i could not hush it up i am the only man who cant hush it up the people of new york elected me to enforce the laws whartons voice was raised to a
