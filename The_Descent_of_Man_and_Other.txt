edith wharton table of contents the descent of man and other stories the descent of man the other two expiation the ladys maids bell the mission of jane the reckoning the letter the dilettante the quicksand a venetian nights entertainment the descent of man i when professor linyard came back from his holiday in the maine woods the air of rejuvenation he brought with him was due less to the influences of the climate than to the companionship he had enjoyed on his travels to mrs linyards observant eye he had appeared to set out alone but an invisible traveller had in fact accompanied him and if his heart beat high it was simply at the pitch of his adventure for the professor had eloped with an idea no one who has not tried the experiment can divine its exhilaration professor linyard would not have changed places with any hero of romance pledged to a fleshandblood abduction the most fascinating female is apt to be encumbered with luggage and scruples to take up a good deal of room in the present and overlap inconveniently into the future whereas an idea can accommodate itself to a single molecule of the brain or expand to the circumference of the horizon the professors companion had to the utmost this quality of adaptability as the express train whirled him away from the somewhat inelastic circle of mrs linyards affections his idea seemed to be sitting opposite him and their eyes met every moment or two in a glance of joyous complicity yet when a friend of the family presently joined him and began to talk about college matters the idea slipped out of sight in a flash and the professor would have had no difficulty in proving that he was alone but if from the outset he found his idea the most agreeable of fellowtravellers it was only in the aromatic solitude of the woods that he tasted the full savour of his adventure there during the long cool august days lying full length on the pineneedles and gazing up into the sky he would meet the eyes of his companion bending over him like a nearer heaven and what eyes they were clear yet unfathomable bubbling with inexhaustible laughter yet drawing their freshness and sparkle from the central depths of thought to a man who for twenty years had faced an eye reflecting the obvious with perfect accuracy these escapes into the inscrutable had always been peculiarly inviting but hitherto the professors mental infidelities had been restricted by an unbroken and relentless domesticity now for the first time since his marriage chance had given him six weeks to himself and he was coming home with his lungs full of liberty it must not be inferred that the professors domestic relations were defective they were in fact so complete that it was almost impossible to get away from them it is the happy husbands who are really in bondage the little rift within the lute is often a passage to freedom marriage had given the professor exactly what he had sought in it a comfortable lining to life the impossibility of rising to sentimental crises had made him scrupulously careful not to shirk the practical obligations of the bond he took as it were a sociological view of his case and modestly regarded himself as a brick in that foundation on which the state is supposed to rest perhaps if mrs linyard had cared about entomology or had taken sides in the war over the transmission of acquired characteristics he might have had a less impersonal notion of marriage but he was unconscious of any deficiency in their relation and if consulted would probably have declared that he didnt want any woman bothering with his beetles his real life had always lain in the universe of thought in that enchanted region which to those who have lingered there comes to have so much more colour and substance than the painted curtain hanging before it the professors particular veil of maia was a narrow strip of homespun woven in a monotonous pattern but he had only to lift it to step into an empire this unseen universe was thronged with the most seductive shapes the professor moved sultanlike through a seraglio of ideas but of all the lovely apparitions that wove their spells about him none had ever worn quite so persuasive an aspect as this latest favourite for the others were mostly rather grave companions seriousminded and elevating enough to have passed muster in a ladies debating club but this new fancy of the professors was simply one embodied laugh it was in other words the smile of relaxation at the end of a long days toil the flash of irony that the laborious mind projects irresistibly over labour conscientiously performed the professor had always been a hard worker if he was an indulgent friend to his ideas he was also a stern taskmaster to them for in addition to their other duties they had to support his family to pay the butcher and baker and provide for jacks schooling and millicents dresses the professors household was a modest one yet it tasked his ideas to keep it up to his wifes standard mrs linyard was not an exacting wife and she took enough pride in her husbands attainments to pay for her honours by turning millicents dresses and darning jacks socks and going to the college receptions year after year in the same black silk with shiny seams it consoled her to see an occasional mention of professor linyards remarkable monograph on the ethical reactions of the infusoria or an allusion to his investigations into the unconscious cerebration of the amoeba still there were moments when the healthy indifference of jack and millicent reacted on the maternal sympathies when mrs linyard would have made her husband a railwaydirector if by this transformation she might have increased her boys allowance and given her daughter a new hat or a set of furs such as the other girls were wearing of such moments of rebellion the professor himself was not wholly unconscious he could not indeed understand why any one should want a new hat and as to an allowance he had had much less money at college than jack and had yet managed to buy a microscope and collect a few specimens while jack was free from such expensive tastes but the professor did not let his want of sympathy interfere with the discharge of his paternal obligations he worked hard to keep the wants of his family gratified and it was precisely in the endeavor to attain this end that he at length broke down and had to cease from work altogether to cease from work was not to cease from thought of it and in the unwonted pause from effort the professor found himself taking a general survey of the field he had travelled at last it was possible to lift his nose from the loom to step a moment in front of the tapestry he had been weaving from this first inspection of the pattern so long wrought over from behind it was natural to glance a little farther and seek its reflection in the public eye it was not indeed of his special task that he thought in this connection he was but one of the great army of weavers at work among the threads of that cosmic woof and what he sought was the general impression their labour had produced when professor linyard first plied his microscope the audience of the man of science had been composed of a few fellowstudents sympathetic or hostile as their habits of mind predetermined but versed in the jargon of the profession and familiar with the point of departure in the intervening quarter of a century however this little group had been swallowed up in a larger public every one now read scientific books and expressed an opinion on them the ladies and the clergy had taken them up first now they had passed to the schoolroom and the kindergarten daily life was regulated on scientific principles the daily papers had their scientific jottings nurses passed examinations in hygienic science and babies were fed and dandled according to the new psychology the very fact that scientific investigation still had to some minds a flavour of heterodoxy gave it a perennial interest the mob had broken down the walls of tradition to batten in the orchard of forbidden knowledge the inaccessible goddess whom the professor had served in his youth now offered her charms in the marketplace and yet it was not the same goddess after all but a pseudoscience masquerading in the garb of the real divinity this false goddess had her ritual and her literature she had her sacred books written by false priests and sold by millions to the faithful in the most successful of these works ancient dogma and modern discovery were depicted in a close embrace under the limelights of a hazy transcendentalism and the tableau never failed of its effect some of the books designed on this popular model had lately fallen into the professors hands and they filled him with mingled rage and hilarity the rage soon died he came to regard this mass of pseudoliterature as protecting the truth from desecration but the hilarity remained and flowed into the form of his idea and the idea the divine incomparable idea was simply that he should avenge his goddess by satirizing her false interpreters he would write a skit on the popular scientific book he would so heap platitude on platitude fallacy on fallacy false analogy on false analogy so use his superior knowledge to abound in the sense of the ignorant that even the gross crowd would join in the laugh against its augurs and the laugh should be something more than the distension of mental muscles it should be the trumpetblast bringing down the walls of ignorance or at least the little stone striking the giant between the eyes ii the professor on presenting his card had imagined that it would command prompt access to the publishers sanctuary but the young man who read his name was not moved to immediate action it was clear that professor linyard of hillbridge university was not a specific figure to the purveyors of popular literature but the publisher was an old friend and when the card had finally drifted to his office on the languid tide of routine he came forth at once to greet his visitor the warmth of his welcome convinced the professor that he had been right in bringing his manuscript to ned harviss he and harviss had been at hillbridge together and the future publisher had been one of the wildest spirits in that band of college outlaws which yearly turns out so many inoffensive citizens and kind husbands and fathers the professor knew the taming qualities of life he was aware that many of his most reckless comrades had been transformed into prudent capitalists or cowed wageearners but he was almost sure that he could count on harviss so rare a sense of irony so keen a perception of relative values could hardly have been blunted even by twenty years intercourse with the obvious the publishers appearance was a little disconcerting he looked as if he had been fattened on popular fiction and his fat was full of optimistic creases the professor seemed to see him bowing into his office a long train of spotless heroines laden with the maiden tribute of the hundredth thousand volume nevertheless his welcome was reassuring he did not disown his early enormities and capped his visitors tentative allusions by such flagrant references to the past that the professor produced his manuscript without a scruple what you dont mean to say youve been doing something in our line the professor smiled you publish scientific books sometimes dont you the publishers optimistic creases relaxed a little hm it all depends im afraid youre a little too scientific for us we have a big sale for scientific breakfast foods but not for the concentrated essences in your case of course i should be delighted to stretch a point but in your own interest i ought to tell you that perhaps one of the educational houses would do you better the professor leaned back still smiling luxuriously well look it over i rather think youll take it oh well take it as i say but the terms might not no matter about the terms the publisher threw his head back with a laugh i had no idea that science was so profitable we find our popular novelists are the hardest hands at a bargain science is disinterested the professor corrected him and i have a fancy to have you publish this thing thats immensely good of you my dear fellow of course your name goes with a certain public and i rather like the originality of our bringing out a work so out of our line i daresay it may boom us both his creases deepened at the thought and he shone encouragingly on the professors leavetaking within a fortnight a line from harviss recalled the professor to town he had been looking forward with immense zest to this second meeting harvisss college roar was in his tympanum and he pictured himself following up the protracted chuckle which would follow his friends progress through the manuscript he was proud of the adroitness with which he had kept his secret from harviss had maintained to the last the pretense of a serious work in order to give the keener edge to his readers enjoyment not since undergraduate days had the professor tasted such a draught of pure fun as his anticipations now poured for him this time his card brought instant admission he was bowed into the office like a successful novelist and harviss grasped him with both hands well do you mean to take it he asked with a lingering coquetry take it take it my dear fellow its in press already youll excuse my not waiting to consult you there will be no difficulty about terms i assure you and we had barely time to catch the autumn market my dear linyard why didnt you tell me his voice sank to a reproachful solemnity and he pushed forward his own armchair the professor dropped into it with a chuckle and miss the joy of letting you find out well it was a joy harviss held out a box of his best cigars i dont know when ive had a bigger sensation it was so deucedly unexpected and my dear fellow youve brought it so exactly to the right shop im glad to hear you say so said the professor modestly harviss laughed in rich appreciation i dont suppose you had a doubt of it but of course i was quite unprepared and its so extraordinarily out of your line the professor took off his glasses and rubbed them with a slow smile would you have thought it so at college harviss stared at college why you were the most iconoclastic devil there was a perceptible pause the professor restored his glasses and looked at his friend well he said simply well echoed the other still staring ah i see you mean that thats what explains it the swing of the pendulum and so forth well i admit its not an uncommon phenomenon ive conformed myself for example most of our crowd have i believe but somehow i hadnt expected it of you the close observer might have detected a faint sadness under the official congratulation of his tone but the professor was too amazed to have an ear for such fine shades expected it of me expected what of me he gasped what in heaven do you think this thing is and he struck his fist on the manuscript which lay between them harviss had recovered his optimistic creases he rested a benevolent eye on the document why your apologia your confession of faith i should call it you surely must have seen which way you were going you cant have written it in your sleep oh no i was wide awake enough said the professor faintly well then why are you staring at me as if i were not harviss leaned forward to lay a reassuring hand on his visitors worn coatsleeve dont mistake me my dear linyard dont fancy there was the least unkindness in my allusion to your change of front what is growth but the shifting of the standpoint why should a man be expected to look at life with the same eyes at twenty and at our age it never occurred to me that you could feel the least delicacy in admitting that you have come round a little have fallen into line so to speak but the professor had sprung up as if to give his lungs more room to expand and from them there issued a laugh which shook the editorial rafters oh lord oh lord is it really as good as that he gasped harviss had glanced instinctively toward the electric bell on his desk it was evident that he was prepared for an emergency my dear fellow he began in a soothing tone oh let me have my laugh out do implored the professor ill ill quiet down in a minute you neednt ring for the young man he dropped into his chair again and grasped its arms to steady his shaking this is the best laugh ive had since college he brought out between his paroxysms and then suddenly he sat up with a groan but if its as good as that its a failure he exclaimed harviss stiffening a little examined the tip of his cigar my dear linyard he said at length i dont understand a word youre saying the professor succumbed to a fresh access from the vortex of which he managed to fling out but thats the very core of the joke harviss looked at him resignedly what is why your not seeing your not understanding not understanding what why what the book is meant to be his laughter subsided again and he sat gazing thoughtfully at the publisher unless it means he wound up that ive overshot the mark if i am the mark you certainly have said harviss with a glance at the clock the professor caught the glance and interpreted it the book is a skit he said rising the other stared a skit its not serious you mean not to me but it seems youve taken it so you never told me began the publisher in a ruffled tone no i never told you said the professor harviss sat staring at the manuscript between them i dont pretend to be up in such recondite forms of humour he said still stiffly of course you address yourself to a very small class of readers oh infinitely small admitted the professor extending his hand toward the manuscript harviss appeared to be pursuing his own train of thought that is he continued if you insist on an ironical interpretation if i insist on it what do you mean the publisher smiled faintly well isnt the book susceptible of another if i read it without seeing well murmured the other fascinated why shouldnt the rest of the world declared harviss boldly i represent the average reader thats my business thats what ive been training myself to do for the last twenty years its a mission like another the thing is to do it thoroughly not to cheat and compromise i know fellows who are publishers in business hours and dilettantes the rest of the time well they never succeed convictions are just as necessary in business as in religion but thats not the point i was going to say that if youll let me handle this book as a genuine thing ill guarantee to make it go the professor stood motionless his hand still on the manuscript a genuine thing he echoed a serious piece of work the expression of your convictions i tell you theres nothing the public likes as much as convictions theyll always follow a man who believes in his own ideas and this book is just on the line of popular interest youve got hold of a big thing its full of hope and enthusiasm its written in the religious key there are passages in it that would do splendidly in a birthday book things that popular preachers would quote in their sermons if youd wanted to catch a big public you couldnt have gone about it in a better way the things perfect for my purpose i wouldnt let you alter a word of it itll sell like a popular novel if youll let me handle it in the right way iii when the professor left harvisss office the manuscript remained behind he thought he had been taken by the huge irony of the situation by the enlarged circumference of the joke in its original form as harviss had said the book would have addressed itself to a very limited circle now it would include the world the elect would understand the crowd would not and his work would thus serve a double purpose and after all nothing was changed in the situation not a word of the book was to be altered the change was merely in the publishers point of view and in the tip he was to give the reviewers the professor had only to hold his tongue and look serious these arguments found a strong reinforcement in the large premium which expressed harvisss sense of his opportunity as a satire the book would have brought its author nothing in fact its cost would have come out of his own pocket since as harviss assured him no publisher would have risked taking it but as a profession of faith as the recantation of an eminent biologist whose leanings had hitherto been supposed to be toward a cold determinism it would bring in a steady income to author and publisher the offer found the professor in a moment of financial perplexity his illness his unwonted holiday the necessity of postponing a course of wellpaid lectures had combined to diminish his resources and when harviss offered him an advance of a thousand dollars the esoteric savour of the joke became irresistible it was still as a joke that he persisted in regarding the transaction and though he had pledged himself not to betray the real intent of the book he held in petto the notion of some day being able to take the public into his confidence as for the initiated they would know at once and however long a face he pulled his colleagues would see the tongue in his cheek meanwhile it fortunately happened that even if the book should achieve the kind of triumph prophesied by harviss it would not appreciably injure its authors professional standing professor linyard was known chiefly as a microscopist on the structure and habits of a certain class of coleoptera he was the most distinguished living authority but none save his intimate friends knew what generalizations on the destiny of man he had drawn from these special studies he might have published a treatise on the filioque without disturbing the confidence of those on whose approval his reputation rested and moreover he was sustained by the thought that one glance at his book would let them into its secret in fact so sure was he of this that he wondered the astute harviss had cared to risk such speedy exposure but harviss had probably reflected that even in this reverberating age the opinions of the laboratory do not easily reach the street and the professor at any rate was not bound to offer advice on this point the determining cause of his consent was the fact that the book was already in press the professor knew little about the workings of the press but the phrase gave him a sense of finality of having been caught himself in the toils of that mysterious engine if he had had time to think the matter over his scruples might have dragged him back but his conscience was eased by the futility of resistance iv mrs linyard did not often read the papers and there was therefore a special significance in her approaching her husband one evening after dinner with a copy of the new york investigator in her hand her expression lent solemnity to the act mrs linyard had a limited but distinctive set of expressions and she now looked as she did when the president of the university came to dine you didnt tell me of this samuel she said in a slightly tremulous voice tell you of what returned the professor reddening to the margin of his baldness that you had published a book i might never have heard of it if mrs pease hadnt brought me the paper her husband rubbed his eyeglasses with a groan oh you would have heard of it he said gloomily mrs linyard stared did you wish to keep it from me samuel and as he made no answer she added with irresistible pride perhaps you dont know what beautiful things have been said about it he took the paper with a reluctant hand has pease been saying beautiful things about it the professor mrs pease didnt say he had mentioned it the author heaved a sigh of relief his book as harviss had prophesied had caught the autumn market had caught and captured it the publisher had conducted the campaign like an experienced strategist he had completely surrounded the enemy every newspaper every periodical held in ambush an advertisement of the vital thing weeks in advance the great commander had begun to form his lines of attack allusions to the remarkable significance of the coming work had appeared first in the scientific and literary reviews spreading thence to the supplements of the daily journals not a moment passed without a quickening touch to the public consciousness seventy millions of people were forced to remember at least once a day that professor linyards book was on the verge of appearing slips emblazoned with the question have you read the vital thing fell from the pages of popular novels and whitened the floors of crowded streetcars the query in large lettering assaulted the traveller at the railway bookstall confronted him on the walls of elevated stations and seemed in its ascending scale about to supplant the interrogations as to soap and stovepolish which animate our rural scenery on the day of publication the professor had withdrawn to his laboratory the shriek of the advertisements was in his ears and his one desire was to avoid all knowledge of the event they heralded a reaction of selfconsciousness had set in and if harvisss cheque had sufficed to buy up the first edition of the vital thing the professor would gladly have devoted it to that purpose but the sense of inevitableness gradually subdued him and he received his wifes copy of the investigator with a kind of impersonal curiosity the review was a long one full of extracts he saw as he glanced over them how well they would look in a volume of selections the reviewer began by thanking his author for sounding with no uncertain voice that note of ringing optimism of faith in mans destiny and the supremacy of good which has too long been silenced by the whining chorus of a decadent nihilism it is well the writer continued when such reminders come to us not from the moralist but from the man of science when from the desiccating atmosphere of the laboratory there rises this glorious cry of faith and reconstruction the review was minute and exhaustive thanks no doubt to harvisss diplomacy it had been given to the investigators best man and the professor was startled by the bold eye with which his emancipated fallacies confronted him under the reviewers handling they made up admirably as truths and their author began to understand harvisss regret that they should be used for any less profitable purpose the investigator as harviss phrased it set the pace and the other journals followed finding it easier to let their critical manofallwork play a variation on the first reviewers theme than to secure an expert to do the book afresh but it was evident that the professor had captured his public for all the resources of the profession could not as harviss gleefully pointed out have carried the book so straight to the heart of the nation there was something noble in the way in which harviss belittled his own share in the achievement and insisted on the inutility of shoving a book which had started with such headway on all i ask you is to admit that i saw what would happen he said with a touch of professional pride i knew youd struck the right note i knew theyd be quoting you from maine to san francisco good as fiction its better itll keep going longer will it said the professor with a slight shudder he was resigned to an ephemeral triumph but the thought of the books persistency frightened him i should say so why you fit in everywhere science theology natural history and then the allforthebest element which is so popular just now why you come right in with the howtorelax series and they sell way up in the millions and then the books so full of tenderness there are such lovely things in it about flowers and children i didnt know an old dryasdust like you could have such a lot of sentiment in him why i actually caught myself snivelling over that passage about the snowdrops piercing the frozen earth and my wife was saying the other day that since shes read the vital thing she begins to think you must write the whatcheer column in the inglenook he threw back his head with a laugh which ended in the inspired cry and by george sir when the thing begins to slow off well start somebody writing against it and that will run us straight into another hundred thousand and as earnest of this belief he drew the professor a supplementary cheque v mrs linyards knock cut short the importunities of the lady who had been trying to persuade the professor to be taken by flashlight at his study table for the christmas number of the inglenook on this point the professor had fancied himself impregnable but the unwonted smile with which he welcomed his wifes intrusion showed that his defences were weakening the lady from the inglenook took the hint with professional promptness but said brightly as she snapped the elastic around her notebook i shant let you forget me professor the groan with which he followed her retreat was interrupted by his wifes question do they pay you for these interviews samuel the professor looked at her with sudden attention not directly he said wondering at her expression she sank down with a sigh indirectly then what is the matter my dear i gave you harvisss second cheque the other day her tears arrested him dont be hard on the boy samuel i really believe your success has turned his head the boy what boy my success explain yourself susan its only that jack has has borrowed some money which he cant repay but you mustnt think him altogether to blame samuel since the success of your book he has been asked about so much its given the children quite a different position millicent says that wherever they go the first question asked is are you any relation of the author of the vital thing of course were all very proud of the book but it entails obligations which you may not have thought of in writing it the professor sat gazing at the letters and newspaper clippings on the studytable which he had just successfully defended from the camera of the inglenook he took up an envelope bearing the name of a popular weekly paper i dont know that the inglenook would help much he said but i suppose this might mrs linyards eyes glowed with maternal avidity what is it samuel a series of scientific sermons for the roundthegaslog column of the womans world i believe that journal has a larger circulation than any other weekly and they pay in proportion he had not even asked the extent of jacks indebtedness it had been so easy to relieve recent domestic difficulties by the timely production of harvisss two cheques that it now seemed natural to get mrs linyard out of the room by promising further reinforcements the professor had indignantly rejected harvisss suggestion that he should follow up his success by a second volume on the same lines he had sworn not to lend more than a passive support to the fraud of the vital thing but the temptation to free himself from mrs linyard prevailed over his last scruples and within an hour he was at work on the scientific sermons the professor was not an unkind man he really enjoyed making his family happy and it was his own business if his reward for so doing was that it kept them out of his way but the success of the vital thing gave him more than this negative satisfaction it enlarged his own existence and opened new doors into other lives the professor during fifty virtuous years had been cognizant of only two types of women the fond and foolish whom one married and the earnest and intellectual whom one did not of the two he infinitely preferred the former even for conversational purposes but as a social instrument woman was unknown to him and it was not till he was drawn into the world on the tide of his literary success that he discovered the deficiencies in his classification of the sex then he learned with astonishment of the existence of a third type the woman who is fond without foolishness and intellectual without earnestness not that the professor inspired or sought to inspire sentimental emotions but he expanded in the warm atmosphere of personal interest which some of his new acquaintances contrived to create about him it was delightful to talk of serious things in a setting of frivolity and to be personal without being domestic even in this new world where all subjects were touched on lightly and emphasis was the only indelicacy the professor found himself constrained to endure an occasional reference to his book it was unpleasant at first but gradually he slipped into the habit of hearing it talked of and grew accustomed to telling pretty women just how it had first come to him meanwhile the success of the scientific sermons was facilitating his family relations his photograph in the inglenook to which the lady of the notebook had succeeded in appending a vivid interview carried his fame to circles inaccessible even to the vital thing and the professor found himself the man of the hour he soon grew used to the functions of the office and gave out hundreddollar interviews on every subject from labourstrikes to babism with a frequency which reacted agreeably on the domestic exchequer presently his head began to figure in the advertising pages of the magazines admiring readers learned the name of the only breakfastfood in use at his table of the ink with which the vital thing had been written the soap with which the authors hands were washed and the tissuebuilder which fortified him for further effort these confidences endeared the professor to millions of readers and his head passed in due course from the magazine and the newspaper to the biscuittin and the chocolatebox vi the professor all the while was leading a double life while the author of the vital thing reaped the fruits of popular approval the distinguished microscopist continued his laboratory work unheeded save by the few who were engaged in the same line of investigations his divided allegiance had not hitherto affected the quality of his work it seemed to him that he returned to the laboratory with greater zest after an afternoon in a drawingroom where readings from the vital thing had alternated with plantation melodies and tea he had long ceased to concern himself with what his colleagues thought of his literary career of the few whom he frequented none had referred to the vital thing and he knew enough of their lives to guess that their silence might as fairly be attributed to indifference as to disapproval they were intensely interested in the professors views on beetles but they really cared very little what he thought of the almighty the professor entirely shared their feelings and one of his chief reasons for cultivating the success which accident had bestowed on him was that it enabled him to command a greater range of appliances for his real work he had known what it was to lack books and instruments and the vital thing was the magic wand which summoned them to his aid for some time he had been feeling his way along the edge of a discovery balancing himself with professional skill on a plank of hypothesis flung across an abyss of uncertainty the conjecture was the result of years of patient gathering of facts its corroboration would take months more of comparison and classification but at the end of the vista victory loomed the professor felt within himself that assurance of ultimate justification which to the man of science makes a lifetime seem the mere comma between premiss and deduction but he had reached the point where his conjectures required formulation it was only by giving them expression by exposing them to the comment and criticism of his associates that he could test their final value and this inner assurance was confirmed by the only friend whose confidence he invited professor pease the husband of the lady who had opened mrs linyards eyes to the triumph of the vital thing was the repository of her husbands scientific experiences what he thought of the vital thing had never been divulged and he was capable of such vast exclusions that it was quite possible that pervasive work had not yet reached him in any case it was not likely to affect his judgment of the authors professional capacity you want to put that all in a book linyard was professor peases summingup im sure youve got hold of something big but to see it clearly yourself you ought to outline it for others take my advice chuck everything else and get to work tomorrow its time you wrote a book anyhow its time you wrote a book anyhow the words smote the professor with mingled pain and ecstasy he could have wept over their significance but his friends other phrase reminded him with a start of harviss you have got hold of a big thing it had been the publishers first comment on the vital thing but what a world of meaning lay between the two phrases it was the world in which the powers who fought for the professor were destined to wage their final battle and for the moment he had no doubt of the outcome the next day he went to town to see harviss he wanted to ask for an advance on the new popular edition of the vital thing he had determined to drop a course of supplementary lectures at the university and to give himself up for a year to his book to do this additional funds were necessary but thanks to the vital thing they would be forthcoming the publisher received him as cordially as usual but the response to his demand was not as prompt as his previous experience had entitled him to expect of course well be glad to do what we can for you linyard but the fact is weve decided to give up the idea of the new edition for the present youve given up the new edition why yes weve done pretty well by the vital thing and were inclined to think its your turn to do something for it now the professor looked at him blankly what can i do for it he asked what more his accent added why put a little new life in it by writing something else the secret of perpetual motion hasnt yet been discovered you know and its one of the laws of literature that books which start with a rush are apt to slow down sooner than the crawlers weve kept the vital thing going for eighteen months but hang it it aint so vital any more we simply couldnt see our way to a new edition oh i dont say its dead yet but its moribund and youre the only man who can resuscitate it the professor continued to stare i what can i do about it he stammered do why write another like it go it one better you know the trick the public isnt tired of you by any means but you want to make yourself heard again before anybody else cuts in write another book write two and well sell them in sets in a box the vital thing series that will take tremendously in the holidays try and let us have a new volume by october ill be glad to give you a big advance if youll sign a contract on that the professor sat silent there was too cruel an irony in the coincidence harviss looked up at him in surprise well whats the matter with taking my advice youre not going out of literature are you the professor rose from his chair no im going into it he said simply going into it im going to write a real book a serious one good lord most people think the vital thing s serious yes but i mean something different in your old line beetles and so forth yes said the professor solemnly harviss looked at him with equal gravity well im sorry for that he said because it takes you out of our bailiwick but i suppose youve made enough money out of the vital thing to permit yourself a little harmless amusement when you want more cash come back to us only dont put it off too long or some other fellow will have stepped into your shoes popularity dont keep you know and the hotter the success the quicker the commodity perishes he leaned back cheerful and sententious delivering his axioms with conscious kindliness the professor who had risen and moved to the door turned back with a wavering step when did you say another volume would have to be ready he faltered i said october but call it a month later you dont need any pushing nowadays and youd have no objection to letting me have a little advance now i need some new instruments for my real work harviss extended a cordial hand my dear fellow thats talking ill write the cheque while you wait and i daresay we can start up the cheap edition of the vital thing at the same time if youll pledge yourself to give us the book by november how much he asked poised above his chequebook in the street the professor stood staring about him uncertain and a little dazed after all its only putting it off for six months he said to himself and i can do better work when i get my new instruments he smiled and raised his hat to the passing victoria of a lady in whose copy of the vital thing he had recently written labor est etiam ipsa voluptas the other two i waythorn on the drawingroom hearth waited for his wife to come down to dinner it was their first night under his own roof and he was surprised at his thrill of boyish agitation he was not so old to be sure his glass gave him little more than the fiveandthirty years to which his wife confessed but he had fancied himself already in the temperate zone yet here he was listening for her step with a tender sense of all it symbolized with some old trail of verse about the garlanded nuptial doorposts floating through his enjoyment of the pleasant room and the good dinner just beyond it they had been hastily recalled from their honeymoon by the illness of lily haskett the child of mrs waythorns first marriage the little girl at waythorns desire had been transferred to his house on the day of her mothers wedding and the doctor on their arrival broke the news that she was ill with typhoid but declared that all the symptoms were favorable lily could show twelve years of unblemished health and the case promised to be a light one the nurse spoke as reassuringly and after a moment of alarm mrs waythorn had adjusted herself to the situation she was very fond of lily her affection for the child had perhaps been her decisive charm in waythorns eyes but she had the perfectly balanced nerves which her little girl had inherited and no woman ever wasted less tissue in unproductive worry waythorn was therefore quite prepared to see her come in presently a little late because of a last look at lily but as serene and wellappointed as if her goodnight kiss had been laid on the brow of health her composure was restful to him it acted as ballast to his somewhat unstable sensibilities as he pictured her bending over the childs bed he thought how soothing her presence must be in illness her very step would prognosticate recovery his own life had been a gray one from temperament rather than circumstance and he had been drawn to her by the unperturbed gayety which kept her fresh and elastic at an age when most womens activities are growing either slack or febrile he knew what was said about her for popular as she was there had always been a faint undercurrent of detraction when she had appeared in new york nine or ten years earlier as the pretty mrs haskett whom gus varick had unearthed somewhere was it in pittsburgh or utica society while promptly accepting her had reserved the right to cast a doubt on its own discrimination inquiry however established her undoubted connection with a socially reigning family and explained her recent divorce as the natural result of a runaway match at seventeen and as nothing was known of mr haskett it was easy to believe the worst of him alice hasketts remarriage with gus varick was a passport to the set whose recognition she coveted and for a few years the varicks were the most popular couple in town unfortunately the alliance was brief and stormy and this time the husband had his champions still even varicks stanchest supporters admitted that he was not meant for matrimony and mrs varicks grievances were of a nature to bear the inspection of the new york courts a new york divorce is in itself a diploma of virtue and in the semiwidowhood of this second separation mrs varick took on an air of sanctity and was allowed to confide her wrongs to some of the most scrupulous ears in town but when it was known that she was to marry waythorn there was a momentary reaction her best friends would have preferred to see her remain in the role of the injured wife which was as becoming to her as crape to a rosy complexion true a decent time had elapsed and it was not even suggested that waythorn had supplanted his predecessor still people shook their heads over him and one grudging friend to whom he affirmed that he took the step with his eyes open replied oracularly yes and with your ears shut waythorn could afford to smile at these innuendoes in the wall street phrase he had discounted them he knew that society has not yet adapted itself to the consequences of divorce and that till the adaptation takes place every woman who uses the freedom the law accords her must be her own social justification waythorn had an amused confidence in his wifes ability to justify herself his expectations were fulfilled and before the wedding took place alice varicks group had rallied openly to her support she took it all imperturbably she had a way of surmounting obstacles without seeming to be aware of them and waythorn looked back with wonder at the trivialities over which he had worn his nerves thin he had the sense of having found refuge in a richer warmer nature than his own and his satisfaction at the moment was humorously summed up in the thought that his wife when she had done all she could for lily would not be ashamed to come down and enjoy a good dinner the anticipation of such enjoyment was not however the sentiment expressed by mrs waythorns charming face when she presently joined him though she had put on her most engaging teagown she had neglected to assume the smile that went with it and waythorn thought he had never seen her look so nearly worried what is it he asked is anything wrong with lily no ive just been in and shes still sleeping mrs waythorn hesitated but something tiresome has happened he had taken her two hands and now perceived that he was crushing a paper between them this letter yes mr haskett has written i mean his lawyer has written waythorn felt himself flush uncomfortably he dropped his wifes hands what about about seeing lily you know the courts yes yes he interrupted nervously nothing was known about haskett in new york he was vaguely supposed to have remained in the outer darkness from which his wife had been rescued and waythorn was one of the few who were aware that he had given up his business in utica and followed her to new york in order to be near his little girl in the days of his wooing waythorn had often met lily on the doorstep rosy and smiling on her way to see papa i am so sorry mrs waythorn murmured he roused himself what does he want he wants to see her you know she goes to him once a week well he doesnt expect her to go to him now does he no he has heard of her illness but he expects to come here here mrs waythorn reddened under his gaze they looked away from each other im afraid he has the rightyoull see she made a proffer of the letter waythorn moved away with a gesture of refusal he stood staring about the softly lighted room which a moment before had seemed so full of bridal intimacy im so sorry she repeated if lily could have been moved thats out of the question he returned impatiently i suppose so her lip was beginning to tremble and he felt himself a brute he must come of course he said when is his day im afraid tomorrow very well send a note in the morning the butler entered to announce dinner waythorn turned to his wife come you must be tired its beastly but try to forget about it he said drawing her hand through his arm youre so good dear ill try she whispered back her face cleared at once and as she looked at him across the flowers between the rosy candleshades he saw her lips waver back into a smile how pretty everything is she sighed luxuriously he turned to the butler the champagne at once please mrs waythorn is tired in a moment or two their eyes met above the sparkling glasses her own were quite clear and untroubled he saw that she had obeyed his injunction and forgotten waythorn moved away with a gesture of refusal ii a small effacedlooking man waythorn the next morning went down town earlier than usual haskett was not likely to come till the afternoon but the instinct of flight drove him forth he meant to stay away all day he had thoughts of dining at his club as his door closed behind him he reflected that before he opened it again it would have admitted another man who had as much right to enter it as himself and the thought filled him with a physical repugnance he caught the elevated at the employees hour and found himself crushed between two layers of pendulous humanity at eighth street the man facing him wriggled out and another took his place waythorn glanced up and saw that it was gus varick the men were so close together that it was impossible to ignore the smile of recognition on varicks handsome overblown face and after all why not they had always been on good terms and varick had been divorced before waythorns attentions to his wife began the two exchanged a word on the perennial grievance of the congested trains and when a seat at their side was miraculously left empty the instinct of selfpreservation made waythorn slip into it after varick the latter drew the stout mans breath of relief lord i was beginning to feel like a pressed flower he leaned back looking unconcernedly at waythorn sorry to hear that sellers is knocked out again sellers echoed waythorn starting at his partners name varick looked surprised you didnt know he was laid up with the gout no ive been away i only got back last night waythorn felt himself reddening in anticipation of the others smile ah yes to be sure and sellerss attack came on two days ago im afraid hes pretty bad very awkward for me as it happens because he was just putting through a rather important thing for me ah waythorn wondered vaguely since when varick had been dealing in important things hitherto he had dabbled only in the shallow pools of speculation with which waythorns office did not usually concern itself it occurred to him that varick might be talking at random to relieve the strain of their propinquity that strain was becoming momentarily more apparent to waythorn and when at cortlandt street he caught sight of an acquaintance and had a sudden vision of the picture he and varick must present to an initiated eye he jumped up with a muttered excuse i hope youll find sellers better said varick civilly and he stammered back if i can be of any use to you and let the departing crowd sweep him to the platform at his office he heard that sellers was in fact ill with the gout and would probably not be able to leave the house for some weeks im sorry it should have happened so mr waythorn the senior clerk said with affable significance mr sellers was very much upset at the idea of giving you such a lot of extra work just now oh thats no matter said waythorn hastily he secretly welcomed the pressure of additional business and was glad to think that when the days work was over he would have to call at his partners on the way home he was late for luncheon and turned in at the nearest restaurant instead of going to his club the place was full and the waiter hurried him to the back of the room to capture the only vacant table in the cloud of cigarsmoke waythorn did not at once distinguish his neighbors but presently looking about him he saw varick seated a few feet off this time luckily they were too far apart for conversation and varick who faced another way had probably not even seen him but there was an irony in their renewed nearness varick was said to be fond of good living and as waythorn sat despatching his hurried luncheon he looked across half enviously at the others leisurely degustation of his meal when waythorn first saw him he had been helping himself with critical deliberation to a bit of camembert at the ideal point of liquefaction and now the cheese removed he was just pouring his cafe double from its little twostoried earthen pot he poured slowly his ruddy profile bent above the task and one beringed white hand steadying the lid of the coffeepot then he stretched his other hand to the decanter of cognac at his elbow filled a liqueurglass took a tentative sip and poured the brandy into his coffeecup waythorn watched him in a kind of fascination what was he thinking of only of the flavor of the coffee and the liqueur had the mornings meeting left no more trace in his thoughts than on his face had his wife so completely passed out of his life that even this odd encounter with her present husband within a week after her remarriage was no more than an incident in his day and as waythorn mused another idea struck him had haskett ever met varick as varick and he had just met the recollection of haskett perturbed him and he rose and left the restaurant taking a circuitous way out to escape the placid irony of varicks nod it was after seven when waythorn reached home he thought the footman who opened the door looked at him oddly how is miss lily he asked in haste doing very well sir a gentleman tell barlow to put off dinner for half an hour waythorn cut him off hurrying upstairs he went straight to his room and dressed without seeing his wife when he reached the drawingroom she was there fresh and radiant lilys day had been good the doctor was not coming back that evening at dinner waythorn told her of sellerss illness and of the resulting complications she listened sympathetically adjuring him not to let himself be overworked and asking vague feminine questions about the routine of the office then she gave him the chronicle of lilys day quoted the nurse and doctor and told him who had called to inquire he had never seen her more serene and unruffled it struck him with a curious pang that she was very happy in being with him so happy that she found a childish pleasure in rehearsing the trivial incidents of her day after dinner they went to the library and the servant put the coffee and liqueurs on a low table before her and left the room she looked singularly soft and girlish in her rosy pale dress against the dark leather of one of his bachelor armchairs a day earlier the contrast would have charmed him he turned away now choosing a cigar with affected deliberation did haskett come he asked with his back to her oh yes he came you didnt see him of course she hesitated a moment i let the nurse see him that was all there was nothing more to ask he swung round toward her applying a match to his cigar well the thing was over for a week at any rate he would try not to think of it she looked up at him a trifle rosier than usual with a smile in her eyes ready for your coffee dear he leaned against the mantelpiece watching her as she lifted the coffeepot the lamplight struck a gleam from her bracelets and tipped her soft hair with brightness how light and slender she was and how each gesture flowed into the next she seemed a creature all compact of harmonies as the thought of haskett receded waythorn felt himself yielding again to the joy of possessorship they were his those white hands with their flitting motions his the light haze of hair the lips and eyes she set down the coffeepot and reaching for the decanter of cognac measured off a liqueurglass and poured it into his cup waythorn uttered a sudden exclamation what is the matter she said startled nothing only i dont take cognac in my coffee oh how stupid of me she cried their eyes met and she blushed a sudden agonized red iii ten days later mr sellers still housebound asked waythorn to call on his way down town the senior partner with his swaddled foot propped up by the fire greeted his associate with an air of embarrassment im sorry my dear fellow ive got to ask you to do an awkward thing for me waythorn waited and the other went on after a pause apparently given to the arrangement of his phrases the fact is when i was knocked out i had just gone into a rather complicated piece of business for gus varick well said waythorn with an attempt to put him at his ease well its this way varick came to me the day before my attack he had evidently had an inside tip from somebody and had made about a hundred thousand he came to me for advice and i suggested his going in with vanderlyn oh the deuce waythorn exclaimed he saw in a flash what had happened the investment was an alluring one but required negotiation he listened intently while sellers put the case before him and the statement ended he said you think i ought to see varick im afraid i cant as yet the doctor is obdurate and this thing cant wait i hate to ask you but no one else in the office knows the ins and outs of it waythorn stood silent he did not care a farthing for the success of varicks venture but the honor of the office was to be considered and he could hardly refuse to oblige his partner very well he said ill do it that afternoon apprised by telephone varick called at the office waythorn waiting in his private room wondered what the others thought of it the newspapers at the time of mrs waythorns marriage had acquainted their readers with every detail of her previous matrimonial ventures and waythorn could fancy the clerks smiling behind varicks back as he was ushered in varick bore himself admirably he was easy without being undignified and waythorn was conscious of cutting a much less impressive figure varick had no head for business and the talk prolonged itself for nearly an hour while waythorn set forth with scrupulous precision the details of the proposed transaction im awfully obliged to you varick said as he rose the fact is im not used to having much money to look after and i dont want to make an ass of myself he smiled and waythorn could not help noticing that there was something pleasant about his smile it feels uncommonly queer to have enough cash to pay ones bills id have sold my soul for it a few years ago waythorn winced at the allusion he had heard it rumored that a lack of funds had been one of the determining causes of the varick separation but it did not occur to him that varicks words were intentional it seemed more likely that the desire to keep clear of embarrassing topics had fatally drawn him into one waythorn did not wish to be outdone in civility well do the best we can for you he said i think this is a good thing youre in oh im sure its immense its awfully good of you varick broke off embarrassed i suppose the things settled now but if if anything happens before sellers is about ill see you again said waythorn quietly he was glad in the end to appear the more selfpossessed of the two the course of lilys illness ran smooth and as the days passed waythorn grew used to the idea of hasketts weekly visit the first time the day came round he stayed out late and questioned his wife as to the visit on his return she replied at once that haskett had merely seen the nurse downstairs as the doctor did not wish any one in the childs sickroom till after the crisis the following week waythorn was again conscious of the recurrence of the day but had forgotten it by the time he came home to dinner the crisis of the disease came a few days later with a rapid decline of fever and the little girl was pronounced out of danger in the rejoicing which ensued the thought of haskett passed out of waythorns mind and one afternoon letting himself into the house with a latchkey he went straight to his library without noticing a shabby hat and umbrella in the hall in the library he found a small effacedlooking man with a thinnish gray beard sitting on the edge of a chair the stranger might have been a pianotuner or one of those mysteriously efficient persons who are summoned in emergencies to adjust some detail of the domestic machinery he blinked at waythorn through a pair of goldrimmed spectacles and said mildly mr waythorn i presume i am lilys father waythorn flushed oh he stammered uncomfortably he broke off disliking to appear rude inwardly he was trying to adjust the actual haskett to the image of him projected by his wifes reminiscences waythorn had been allowed to infer that alices first husband was a brute i am sorry to intrude said haskett with his overthecounter politeness dont mention it returned waythorn collecting himself i suppose the nurse has been told i presume so i can wait said haskett he had a resigned way of speaking as though life had worn down his natural powers of resistance waythorn stood on the threshold nervously pulling off his gloves im sorry youve been detained i will send for the nurse he said and as he opened the door he added with an effort im glad we can give you a good report of lily he winced as the we slipped out but haskett seemed not to notice it thank you mr waythorn its been an anxious time for me ah well thats past soon shell be able to go to you waythorn nodded and passed out in his own room he flung himself down with a groan he hated the womanish sensibility which made him suffer so acutely from the grotesque chances of life he had known when he married that his wifes former husbands were both living and that amid the multiplied contacts of modern existence there were a thousand chances to one that he would run against one or the other yet he found himself as much disturbed by his brief encounter with haskett as though the law had not obligingly removed all difficulties in the way of their meeting waythorn sprang up and began to pace the room nervously he had not suffered half so much from his two meetings with varick it was hasketts presence in his own house that made the situation so intolerable he stood still hearing steps in the passage this way please he heard the nurse say haskett was being taken upstairs then not a corner of the house but was open to him waythorn dropped into another chair staring vaguely ahead of him on his dressingtable stood a photograph of alice taken when he had first known her she was alice varick then how fine and exquisite he had thought her those were varicks pearls about her neck at waythorns instance they had been returned before her marriage had haskett ever given her any trinkets and what had become of them waythorn wondered he realized suddenly that he knew very little of hasketts past or present situation but from the mans appearance and manner of speech he could reconstruct with curious precision the surroundings of alices first marriage and it startled him to think that she had in the background of her life a phase of existence so different from anything with which he had connected her varick whatever his faults was a gentleman in the conventional traditional sense of the term the sense which at that moment seemed oddly enough to have most meaning to waythorn he and varick had the same social habits spoke the same language understood the same allusions but this other manit was grotesquely uppermost in waythorns mind that haskett had worn a madeup tie attached with an elastic why should that ridiculous detail symbolize the whole man waythorn was exasperated by his own paltriness but the fact of the tie expanded forced itself on him became as it were the key to alices past he could see her as mrs haskett sitting in a front parlor furnished in plush with a pianola and a copy of ben hur on the centretable he could see her going to the theatre with haskett or perhaps even to a church sociable she in a picture hat and haskett in a black frockcoat a little creased with the madeup tie on an elastic on the way home they would stop and look at the illuminated shopwindows lingering over the photographs of new york actresses on sunday afternoons haskett would take her for a walk pushing lily ahead of them in a white enameled perambulator and waythorn had a vision of the people they would stop and talk to he could fancy how pretty alice must have looked in a dress adroitly constructed from the hints of a new york fashionpaper how she must have looked down on the other women chafing at her life and secretly feeling that she belonged in a bigger place for the moment his foremost thought was one of wonder at the way in which she had shed the phase of existence which her marriage with haskett implied it was as if her whole aspect every gesture every inflection every allusion were a studied negation of that period of her life if she had denied being married to haskett she could hardly have stood more convicted of duplicity than in this obliteration of the self which had been his wife waythorn started up checking himself in the analysis of her motives what right had he to create a fantastic effigy of her and then pass judgment on it she had spoken vaguely of her first marriage as unhappy had hinted with becoming reticence that haskett had wrought havoc among her young illusionsit was a pity for waythorns peace of mind that hasketts very inoffensiveness shed a new light on the nature of those illusions a man would rather think that his wife has been brutalized by her first husband than that the process has been reversed why how do you do she said with a distinct note of pleasure iv mr waythorn i dont like that french governess of lilys haskett subdued and apologetic stood before waythorn in the library revolving his shabby hat in his hand waythorn surprised in his armchair over the evening paper stared back perplexedly at his visitor youll excuse my asking to see you haskett continued but this is my last visit and i thought if i could have a word with you it would be a better way than writing to mrs waythorns lawyer waythorn rose uneasily he did not like the french governess either but that was irrelevant i am not so sure of that he returned stiffly but since you wish it i will give your message to my wife he always hesitated over the possessive pronoun in addressing haskett the latter sighed i dont know as that will help much she didnt like it when i spoke to her waythorn turned red when did you see her he asked not since the first day i came to see lily right after she was taken sick i remarked to her then that i didnt like the governess waythorn made no answer he remembered distinctly that after that first visit he had asked his wife if she had seen haskett she had lied to him then but she had respected his wishes since and the incident cast a curious light on her character he was sure she would not have seen haskett that first day if she had divined that waythorn would object and the fact that she did not divine it was almost as disagreeable to the latter as the discovery that she had lied to him i dont like the woman haskett was repeating with mild persistency she aint straight mr waythorn shell teach the child to be underhand ive noticed a change in lily shes too anxious to please and she dont always tell the truth she used to be the straightest child mr waythorn he broke off his voice a little thick not but what i want her to have a stylish education he ended waythorn was touched im sorry mr haskett but frankly i dont quite see what i can do haskett hesitated then he laid his hat on the table and advanced to the hearthrug on which waythorn was standing there was nothing aggressive in his manner but he had the solemnity of a timid man resolved on a decisive measure theres just one thing you can do mr waythorn he said you can remind mrs waythorn that by the decree of the courts i am entitled to have a voice in lilys bringing up he paused and went on more deprecatingly im not the kind to talk about enforcing my rights mr waythorn i dont know as i think a man is entitled to rights he hasnt known how to hold on to but this business of the child is different ive never let go there and i never mean to the scene left waythorn deeply shaken shamefacedly in indirect ways he had been finding out about haskett and all that he had learned was favorable the little man in order to be near his daughter had sold out his share in a profitable business in utica and accepted a modest clerkship in a new york manufacturing house he boarded in a shabby street and had few acquaintances his passion for lily filled his life waythorn felt that this exploration of haskett was like groping about with a darklantern in his wifes past but he saw now that there were recesses his lantern had not explored he had never inquired into the exact circumstances of his wifes first matrimonial rupture on the surface all had been fair it was she who had obtained the divorce and the court had given her the child but waythorn knew how many ambiguities such a verdict might cover the mere fact that haskett retained a right over his daughter implied an unsuspected compromise waythorn was an idealist he always refused to recognize unpleasant contingencies till he found himself confronted with them and then he saw them followed by a special train of consequences his next days were thus haunted and he determined to try to lay the ghosts by conjuring them up in his wifes presence when he repeated hasketts request a flame of anger passed over her face but she subdued it instantly and spoke with a slight quiver of outraged motherhood it is very ungentlemanly of him she said the word grated on waythorn that is neither here nor there its a bare question of rights she murmured its not as if he could ever be a help to lily waythorn flushed this was even less to his taste the question is he repeated what authority has he over her she looked downward twisting herself a little in her seat i am willing to see him i thought you objected she faltered in a flash he understood that she knew the extent of hasketts claims perhaps it was not the first time she had resisted them my objecting has nothing to do with it he said coldly if haskett has a right to be consulted you must consult him she burst into tears and he saw that she expected him to regard her as a victim haskett did not abuse his rights waythorn had felt miserably sure that he would not but the governess was dismissed and from time to time the little man demanded an interview with alice after the first outburst she accepted the situation with her usual adaptability haskett had once reminded waythorn of the pianotuner and mrs waythorn after a month or two appeared to class him with that domestic familiar waythorn could not but respect the fathers tenacity at first he had tried to cultivate the suspicion that haskett might be up to something that he had an object in securing a foothold in the house but in his heart waythorn was sure of hasketts singlemindedness he even guessed in the latter a mild contempt for such advantages as his relation with the waythorns might offer hasketts sincerity of purpose made him invulnerable and his successor had to accept him as a lien on the property mr sellers was sent to europe to recover from his gout and varicks affairs hung on waythorns hands the negotiations were prolonged and complicated they necessitated frequent conferences between the two men and the interests of the firm forbade waythorns suggesting that his client should transfer his business to another office varick appeared well in the transaction in moments of relaxation his coarse streak appeared and waythorn dreaded his geniality but in the office he was concise and clearheaded with a flattering deference to waythorns judgment their business relations being so affably established it would have been absurd for the two men to ignore each other in society the first time they met in a drawingroom varick took up their intercourse in the same easy key and his hostesss grateful glance obliged waythorn to respond to it after that they ran across each other frequently and one evening at a ball waythorn wandering through the remoter rooms came upon varick seated beside his wife she colored a little and faltered in what she was saying but varick nodded to waythorn without rising and the latter strolled on in the carriage on the way home he broke out nervously i didnt know you spoke to varick her voice trembled a little its the first time he happened to be standing near me i didnt know what to do its so awkward meeting everywhere and he said you had been very kind about some business thats different said waythorn she paused a moment ill do just as you wish she returned pliantly i thought it would be less awkward to speak to him when we meet her pliancy was beginning to sicken him had she really no will of her own no theory about her relation to these men she had accepted haskett did she mean to accept varick it was less awkward as she had said and her instinct was to evade difficulties or to circumvent them with sudden vividness waythorn saw how the instinct had developed she was as easy as an old shoe a shoe that too many feet had worn her elasticity was the result of tension in too many different directions alice haskett alice varick alice waythorn she had been each in turn and had left hanging to each name a little of her privacy a little of her personality a little of the inmost self where the unknown god abides yes its better to speak to varick said waythorn wearily earths martyrs by stephen phillips v the winter wore on and society took advantage of the waythorns acceptance of varick harassed hostesses were grateful to them for bridging over a social difficulty and mrs waythorn was held up as a miracle of good taste some experimental spirits could not resist the diversion of throwing varick and his former wife together and there were those who thought he found a zest in the propinquity but mrs waythorns conduct remained irreproachable she neither avoided varick nor sought him out even waythorn could not but admit that she had discovered the solution of the newest social problem he had married her without giving much thought to that problem he had fancied that a woman can shed her past like a man but now he saw that alice was bound to hers both by the circumstances which forced her into continued relation with it and by the traces it had left on her nature with grim irony waythorn compared himself to a member of a syndicate he held so many shares in his wifes personality and his predecessors were his partners in the business if there had been any element of passion in the transaction he would have felt less deteriorated by it the fact that alice took her change of husbands like a change of weather reduced the situation to mediocrity he could have forgiven her for blunders for excesses for resisting hackett for yielding to varick for anything but her acquiescence and her tact she reminded him of a juggler tossing knives but the knives were blunt and she knew they would never cut her and then gradually habit formed a protecting surface for his sensibilities if he paid for each days comfort with the small change of his illusions he grew daily to value the comfort more and set less store upon the coin he had drifted into a dulling propinquity with haskett and varick and he took refuge in the cheap revenge of satirizing the situation he even began to reckon up the advantages which accrued from it to ask himself if it were not better to own a third of a wife who knew how to make a man happy than a whole one who had lacked opportunity to acquire the art for it was an art and made up like all others of concessions eliminations and embellishments of lights judiciously thrown and shadows skillfully softened his wife knew exactly how to manage the lights and he knew exactly to what training she owed her skill he even tried to trace the source of his obligations to discriminate between the influences which had combined to produce his domestic happiness he perceived that hasketts commonness had made alice worship good breeding while varicks liberal construction of the marriage bond had taught her to value the conjugal virtues so that he was directly indebted to his predecessors for the devotion which made his life easy if not inspiring from this phase he passed into that of complete acceptance he ceased to satirize himself because time dulled the irony of the situation and the joke lost its humor with its sting even the sight of hasketts hat on the hall table had ceased to touch the springs of epigram the hat was often seen there now for it had been decided that it was better for lilys father to visit her than for the little girl to go to his boardinghouse waythorn having acquiesced in this arrangement had been surprised to find how little difference it made haskett was never obtrusive and the few visitors who met him on the stairs were unaware of his identity waythorn did not know how often he saw alice but with himself haskett was seldom in contact one afternoon however he learned on entering that lilys father was waiting to see him in the library he found haskett occupying a chair in his usual provisional way waythorn always felt grateful to him for not leaning back i hope youll excuse me mr waythorn he said rising i wanted to see mrs waythorn about lily and your man asked me to wait here till she came in of course said waythorn remembering that a sudden leak had that morning given over the drawingroom to the plumbers he opened his cigarcase and held it out to his visitor and hasketts acceptance seemed to mark a fresh stage in their intercourse the spring evening was chilly and waythorn invited his guest to draw up his chair to the fire he meant to find an excuse to leave haskett in a moment but he was tired and cold and after all the little man no longer jarred on him the two were inclosed in the intimacy of their blended cigarsmoke when the door opened and varick walked into the room waythorn rose abruptly it was the first time that varick had come to the house and the surprise of seeing him combined with the singular inopportuneness of his arrival gave a new edge to waythorns blunted sensibilities he stared at his visitor without speaking varick seemed too preoccupied to notice his hosts embarrassment my dear fellow he exclaimed in his most expansive tone i must apologize for tumbling in on you in this way but i was too late to catch you down town and so i thought he stopped short catching sight of haskett and his sanguine color deepened to a flush which spread vividly under his scant blond hair but in a moment he recovered himself and nodded slightly haskett returned the bow in silence and waythorn was still groping for speech when the footman came in carrying a teatable the intrusion offered a welcome vent to waythorns nerves what the deuce are you bringing this here for he said sharply i beg your pardon sir but the plumbers are still in the drawingroom and mrs waythorn said she would have tea in the library the footmans perfectly respectful tone implied a reflection on waythorns reasonableness oh very well said the latter resignedly and the footman proceeded to open the folding teatable and set out its complicated appointments while this interminable process continued the three men stood motionless watching it with a fascinated stare till waythorn to break the silence said to varick wont you have a cigar he held out the case he had just tendered to haskett and varick helped himself with a smile waythorn looked about for a match and finding none proffered a light from his own cigar haskett in the background held his ground mildly examining his cigartip now and then and stepping forward at the right moment to knock its ashes into the fire the footman at last withdrew and varick immediately began if i could just say half a word to you about this business certainly stammered waythorn in the diningroom but as he placed his hand on the door it opened from without and his wife appeared on the threshold she came in fresh and smiling in her street dress and hat shedding a fragrance from the boa which she loosened in advancing shall we have tea in here dear she began and then she caught sight of varick her smile deepened veiling a slight tremor of surprise why how do you do she said with a distinct note of pleasure as she shook hands with varick she saw haskett standing behind him her smile faded for a moment but she recalled it quickly with a scarcely perceptible sideglance at waythorn how do you do mr haskett she said and shook hands with him a shade less cordially the three men stood awkwardly before her till varick always the most selfpossessed dashed into an explanatory phrase we i had to see waythorn a moment on business he stammered brickred from chin to nape haskett stepped forward with his air of mild obstinacy i am sorry to intrude but you appointed five oclock he directed his resigned glance to the timepiece on the mantel she swept aside their embarrassment with a charming gesture of hospitality im so sorry im always late but the afternoon was so lovely she stood drawing her gloves off propitiatory and graceful diffusing about her a sense of ease and familiarity in which the situation lost its grotesqueness but before talking business she added brightly im sure every one wants a cup of tea she dropped into her low chair by the teatable and the two visitors as if drawn by her smile advanced to receive the cups she held out she glanced about for waythorn and he took the third cup with a laugh expiation i i can never said mrs fetherel hear the bell ring without a shudder her unruffled aspect she was the kind of woman whose emotions never communicate themselves to her clothes and the conventional background of the new york drawingroom with its pervading implication of an imminent teatray and of an atmosphere in which the social functions have become purely reflex lent to her declaration a relief not lost on her cousin mrs clinch who from the other side of the fireplace agreed with a glance at the clock that it was the hour for bores bores cried mrs fetherel impatiently if i shuddered at them i should have a chronic ague she leaned forward and laid a sparkling finger on her cousins shabby black knee i mean the newspaper clippings she whispered mrs clinch returned a glance of intelligence theyve begun already not yet but theyre sure to now at any minute my publisher tells me mrs fetherels look of apprehension sat oddly on her small features which had an air of neat symmetry somehow suggestive of being set in order every morning by the housemaid some one there were rumors that it was her cousin had once said that paula fetherel would have been very pretty if she hadnt looked so like a moral axiom in a copybook hand mrs clinch received her confidence with a smile well she said i suppose you were prepared for the consequences of authorship mrs fetherel blushed brightly it isnt their coming she owned its their coming now now the bishops in town mrs clinch leaned back and shaped her lips to a whistle which deflected in a laugh well she said you see mrs fetherel triumphed well werent you prepared for the bishop not now at least i hadnt thought of his seeing the clippings and why should he see them bella wont you understand its john john who has taken the most unexpected tone one might almost say out of perversity oh perversity mrs clinch murmured observing her cousin between lids wrinkled by amusement what tone has john taken mrs fetherel threw out her answer with the desperate gesture of a woman who lays bare the traces of a marital fist the tone of being proud of my book the measure of mrs clinchs enjoyment overflowed in laughter oh you may laugh mrs fetherel insisted but its no joke to me in the first place johns liking the book is so so such a false note it puts me in such a ridiculous position and then it has set him watching for the reviews who would ever have suspected john of knowing that books were reviewed why hes actually found out about the clipping bureau and whenever the postman rings i hear john rush out of the library to see if there are any yellow envelopes of course when they do come hell bring them into the drawingroom and read them aloud to everybody who happens to be here and the bishop is sure to happen to be here mrs clinch repressed her amusement the picture you draw is a lurid one she conceded but your modesty strikes me as abnormal especially in an author the chances are that some of the clippings will be rather pleasant reading the critics are not all union men mrs fetherel stared union men well i mean they dont all belong to the wellknown societyforthepersecutionofrisingauthors some of them have even been known to defy its regulations and say a good word for a new writer oh i dare say said mrs fetherel with the laugh her cousins epigram exacted but you dont quite see my point im not at all nervous about the success of my book my publisher tells me i have no need to be but i am afraid of its being a succes de scandale mercy said mrs clinch sitting up the butler and footman at this moment appeared with the teatray and when they had withdrawn mrs fetherel bending her brightly rippled head above the kettle continued in a murmur of avowal the title even is a kind of challenge fast and loose mrs clinch mused yes it ought to take i didnt choose it for that reason the author protested i should have preferred something quieter less pronounced but i was determined not to shirk the responsibility of what i had written i want people to know beforehand exactly what kind of book they are buying well said mrs clinch thats a degree of conscientiousness that ive never met with before so few books fulfil the promise of their titles that experienced readers never expect the fare to come up to the menu fast and loose will be no disappointment on that score her cousin significantly returned ive handled the subject without gloves ive called a spade a spade you simply make my mouth water and to think i havent been able to read it yet because every spare minute of my time has been given to correcting the proofs of how the birds keep christmas theres an instance of the hardships of an authors life mrs fetherels eye clouded dont joke bella please i suppose to experienced authors theres always something absurd in the nervousness of a new writer but in my case so much is at stake ive put so much of myself into this book and im so afraid of being misunderstoodof being as it were in advance of my time like poor flauberti know youll think me ridiculous and if only my own reputation were at stake i should never give it a thoughtbut the idea of dragging johns name through the mire mrs clinch who had risen and gathered her cloak about her stood surveying from her genial height her cousins agitated countenance why did you use johns name then thats another of my difficulties i had to there would have been no merit in publishing such a book under an assumed name it would have been an act of moral cowardice fast and loose is not an ordinary novel a writer who dares to show up the hollowness of social conventions must have the courage of her convictions and be willing to accept the consequences of defying society can you imagine ibsen or tolstoy writing under a false name mrs fetherel lifted a tragic eye to her cousin you dont know bella how often ive envied you since i began to write i used to wonder sometimes you wont mind my saying so why with all your cleverness you hadnt taken up some more exciting subject than natural history but i see now how wise you were whatever happens you will never be denounced by the press is that what youre afraid of asked mrs clinch as she grasped the bulging umbrella which rested against her chair my dear if i had ever had the good luck to be denounced by the press my brougham would be waiting at the door for me at this very moment and i shouldnt have to ruin this umbrella by using it in the rain why you innocent if id ever felt the slightest aptitude for showing up social conventions do you suppose i should waste my time writing nests ajar and how to smell the flowers theres a fairly steady demand for pseudoscience and colloquial ornithology but its nothing simply nothing to the ravenous call for attacks on social institutions especially by those inside the institutions there was often to her cousin a lack of taste in mrs clinchs pleasantries and on this occasion they seemed more than usually irrelevant fast and loose was not written with the idea of a large sale mrs clinch was unperturbed perhaps thats just as well she returned with a philosophic shrug the surprise will be all the pleasanter i mean for of course its going to sell tremendously especially if you can get the press to denounce it bella how can you i sometimes think you say such things expressly to tease me and yet i should think you of all women would understand my purpose in writing such a book it has always seemed to me that the message i had to deliver was not for myself alone but for all the other women in the world who have felt the hollowness of our social shams the ignominy of bowing down to the idols of the market but have lacked either the courage or the power to proclaim their independence and i have fancied bella dear that however severely society might punish me for revealing its weaknesses i could count on the sympathy of those who like you mrs fetherels voice sank have passed through the deep waters mrs clinch gave herself a kind of canine shake as though to free her ample shoulders from any drop of the element she was supposed to have traversed oh call them muddy rather than deep she returned and youll find my dear that women whove had any wading to do are rather shy of stirring up mud it sticks especially on white clothes mrs fetherel lifted an undaunted brow im not afraid she proclaimed and at the same instant she dropped her teaspoon with a clatter and shrank back into her seat theres the bell she exclaimed and i know its the bishop it was in fact the bishop of ossining who impressively announced by mrs fetherels butler now made an entry that may best be described as not inadequate to the expectations the announcement raised the bishop always entered a room well but when unannounced or preceded by a low church butler who gave him his surname his appearance lacked the impressiveness conferred on it by the due specification of his diocesan dignity the bishop was very fond of his niece mrs fetherel and one of the traits he most valued in her was the possession of a butler who knew how to announce a bishop mrs clinch was also his niece but aside from the fact that she possessed no butler at all she had laid herself open to her uncles criticism by writing insignificant little books which had a way of going into five or ten editions while the fruits of his own episcopal leisure the wail of jonah twenty cantos in blank verse and through a glass brightly or how to raise funds fora memorial window inexplicably languished on the back shelves of a publisher noted for his dexterity in pushing devotional goods even this indiscretion the bishop might however have condoned had his niece thought fit to turn to him for support and advice at the painful juncture of her history when in her own words it became necessary for her to invite mr clinch to look out for another situation mr clinchs misconduct was of the kind especially designed by providence to test the fortitude of a christian wife and mother and the bishop was absolutely distended with seasonable advice and edification so that when bella met his tentative exhortations with the curt remark that she preferred to do her own housecleaning unassisted her uncles grief at her ingratitude was not untempered with sympathy for mr clinch it is not surprising therefore that the bishops warmest greetings were always reserved for mrs fetherel and on this occasion mrs clinch thought she detected in the salutation which fell to her share a pronounced suggestion that her own presence was superfluous a hint which she took with her usual imperturbable good humor ii left alone with the bishop mrs fetherel sought the nearest refuge from conversation by offering him a cup of tea the bishop accepted with the preoccupied air of a man to whom for the moment tea is but a subordinate incident mrs fetherels nervousness increased and knowing that the surest way of distracting attention from ones own affairs is to affect an interest in those of ones companion she hastily asked if her uncle had come to town on business on business yes said the bishop in an impressive tone i had to see my publisher who has been behaving rather unsatisfactorily in regard to my last book ah your last book faltered mrs fetherel with a sickening sense of her inability to recall the name or nature of the work in question and a mental vow never again to be caught in such ignorance of a colleagues productions through a glass brightly the bishop explained with an emphasis which revealed his detection of her predicament you may remember that i sent you a copy last christmas of course i do mrs fetherel brightened it was that delightful story of the poor consumptive girl who had no money and two little brothers to support sisters idiot sisters the bishop gloomily corrected i mean sisters and who managed to collect money enough to put up a beautiful memorial window to her her grandfather whom she had never seen but whose sermons had been her chief consolation and support during her long struggle with poverty and disease the bishop gave the satisfied sigh of the workman who reviews his completed task a touching subject surely and i believe i did it justice at least so my friends assured me why yes i remember there was a splendid review of it in the reredos cried mrs fetherel moved by the incipient instinct of reciprocity yes by my dear friend mrs gollinger whose husband the late dean gollinger was under very particular obligations to me mrs gollinger is a woman of rare literary acumen and her praise of my book was unqualified but the public wants more highly seasoned fare and the approval of a thoughtful churchwoman carries less weight than the sensational comments of an illiterate journalist the bishop lent a meditative eye on his spotless gaiters at the risk of horrifying you my dear he added with a slight laugh i will confide to you that my best chance of a popular success would be to have my book denounced by the press denounced gasped mrs fetherel on what ground on the ground of immorality the bishop evaded her startled gaze such a thing is inconceivable to you of course but i am only repeating what my publisher tells me if for instance a critic could be induced i mean if a critic were to be found who called in question the morality of my heroine in sacrificing her own health and that of her idiot sisters in order to put up a memorial window to her grandfather it would probably raise a general controversy in the newspapers and i might count on a sale of ten or fifteen thousand within the next year if he described her as morbid or decadent it might even run to twenty thousand but that is more than i permit myself to hope in fact i should be satisfied with any general charge of immorality the bishop sighed again i need hardly tell you that i am actuated by no mere literary ambition those whose opinion i most value have assured me that the book is not without merit but though it does not become me to dispute their verdict i can truly say that my vanity as an author is not at stake i have however a special reason for wishing to increase the circulation of through a glass brightly it was written for a purpose a purpose i have greatly at heart i know cried his niece sympathetically the chantry window is still empty alas and i had great hopes that under providence my little book might be the means of filling it all our wealthy parishioners have given lavishly to the cathedral and it was for this reason that in writing through a glass i addressed my appeal more especially to the less wellendowed hoping by the example of my heroine to stimulate the collection of small sums throughout the entire diocese and perhaps beyond it i am sure the bishop feelingly concluded the book would have a widespread influence if people could only be induced to read it his conclusion touched a fresh thread of association in mrs fetherels vibrating nervecenters i never thought of that she cried the bishop looked at her inquiringly that ones books may not be read at all how dreadful she exclaimed he smiled faintly i had not forgotten that i was addressing an authoress he said indeed i should not have dared to inflict my troubles on any one not of the craft mrs fetherel was quivering with the consciousness of her involuntary selfbetrayal oh uncle she murmured in fact the bishop continued with a gesture which seemed to brush away her scruples i came here partly to speak to you about your novel fast and loose i think you call it mrs fetherel blushed assentingly and is it out yet the bishop continued it came out about a week ago but you havent touched your tea and it must be quite cold let me give you another cup my reason for asking the bishop went on with the bland inexorableness with which in his younger days he had been known to continue a sermon after the senior warden had looked four times at his watch my reason for asking is that i hoped i might not be too late to induce you to change the title mrs fetherel set down the cup she had filled the title she faltered the bishop raised a reassuring hand dont misunderstand me dear child dont for a moment imagine that i take it to be in anyway indicative of the contents of the book i know you too well for that my first idea was that it had probably been forced on you by an unscrupulous publisher i know too well to what ignoble compromises one may be driven in such cases he paused as though to give her the opportunity of confirming this conjecture but she preserved an apprehensive silence and he went on as though taking up the second point in his sermon or again the name may have taken your fancy without your realizing all that it implies to minds more alive than yours to offensive innuendoes it is ahem excessively suggestive and i hope i am not too late to warn you of the false impression it is likely to produce on the very readers whose approbation you would most value my friend mrs gollinger for instance mrs fetherel as the publication of her novel testified was in theory a woman of independent views and if in practise she sometimes failed to live up to her standard it was rather from an irresistible tendency to adapt herself to her environment than from any conscious lack of moral courage the bishops exordium had excited in her that sense of opposition which such admonitions are apt to provoke but as he went on she felt herself gradually enclosed in an atmosphere in which her theories vainly gasped for breath the bishop had the immense dialectical advantage of invalidating any conclusions at variance with his own by always assuming that his premises were among the necessary laws of thought this method combined with the habit of ignoring any classifications but his own created an element in which the first condition of existence was the immediate adoption of his standpoint so that his niece as she listened seemed to feel mrs gollingers mechlin cap spreading its conventual shadow over her rebellious brow and the revue de paris at her elbow turning into a copy of the reredos she had meant to assure her uncle that she was quite aware of the significance of the title she had chosen that it had been deliberately selected as indicating the subject of her novel and that the book itself had been written indirect defiance of the class of readers for whose susceptibilities she was alarmed the words were almost on her lips when the irresistible suggestion conveyed by the bishops tone and language deflected them into the apologetic murmur oh uncle you mustnt think i never meant how much farther this current of reaction might have carried her the historian is unable to computer for at this point the door opened and her husband entered the room the first review of your book he cried flourishing a yellow envelope my dear bishop how lucky youre here though the trials of married life have been classified and catalogued with exhaustive accuracy there is one form of conjugal misery which has perhaps received inadequate attention and that is the suffering of the versatile woman whose husband is not equally adapted to all her moods every woman feels for the sister who is compelled to wear a bonnet which does not go with her gown but how much sympathy is given to her whose husband refuses to harmonize with the pose of the moment scant justice has for instance been done to the misunderstood wife whose husband persists in understanding her to the submissive helpmate whose taskmaster shuns every opportunity of browbeating her and to the generous and impulsive being whose bills are paid with philosophic calm mrs fetherel as wives go had been fairly exempt from trials of this nature for her husband if undistinguished by pronounced brutality or indifference had at least the negative merit of being her intellectual inferior landscape gardeners who are aware of the usefulness of a valley in emphasizing the height of a hill can form an idea of the account to which an accomplished woman may turn such deficiencies and it need scarcely be said that mrs fetherel had made the most of her opportunities it was agreeably obvious to every one fetherel included that he was not the man to appreciate such a woman but there are no limits to mans perversity and he did his best to invalidate this advantage by admiring her without pretending to understand her what she most suffered from was this fatuous approval the maddening sense that however she conducted herself he would always admire her had he belonged to the class whose conversational supplies are drawn from the domestic circle his wifes name would never have been off his lips and to mrs fetherels sensitive perceptions his frequent silences were indicative of the fact that she was his one topic it was in part the attempt to escape this persistent approbation that had driven mrs fetherel to authorship she had fancied that even the most infatuated husband might be counted onto resent at least negatively an attack on the sanctity of the hearth and her anticipations were heightened by a sense of the unpardonableness of her act mrs fetherels relations with her husband were in fact complicated by an irrepressible tendency to be fond of him and there was a certain pleasure in the prospect of a situation that justified the most explicit expiation these hopes fetherels attitude had already defeated he read the book with enthusiasm he pressed it on his friends he sent a copy to his mother and his very soul now hung on the verdict of the reviewers it was perhaps this proof of his general ineptitude that made his wife doubly alive to his special defects so that his inopportune entrance was aggravated by the very sound of his voice and the hopeless aberration of his smile nothing to the observant is more indicative of a mans character and circumstances than his way of entering a room the bishop of ossining for instance brought with him not only an atmosphere of episcopal authority but an implied opinion on the verbal inspiration of the scriptures and on the attitude of the church toward divorce while the appearance of mrs fetherels husband produced an immediate impression of domestic felicity his mere aspect implied that there was a wellfilled nursery upstairs that this wife if she did not sew on his buttons at least superintended the performance of that task that they both went to church regularly and that they dined with his mother every sunday evening punctually at seven oclock all this and more was expressed in the affectionate gesture with which he now raised the yellow envelope above mrs fetherels clutch and knowing the uselessness of begging him not to be silly she said with a dry despair youre boring the bishop horribly fetherel turned a radiant eye on that dignitary she bores us all horribly doesnt she sir he exulted have you read it said his wife uncontrollably read it of course not its just this minute come i say bishop youre not going not till ive heard this said the bishop settling himself in his chair with an indulgent smile his niece glanced at him despairingly dont let johns nonsense detain you she entreated detain him thats good guffawed fetherel it isnt as long as one of his sermons wont take me five minutes to read here listen to this ladies and gentlemen in this age of festering pessimism and decadent depravity it is no surprise to the nauseated reviewer to open one more volume saturated with the fetid emanations of the sewer fetherel who was not in the habit of reading aloud paused with a gasp and the bishop glanced sharply at his niece who kept her gaze fixed on the teacup she had not yet succeeded in transferring to his hand of the sewer her husband resumed but his wonder is proportionately great when he lights on a novel as sweetly inoffensive as paula fetherels fast and loose mrs fetherel is we believe a new hand at fiction and her work reveals frequent traces of inexperience but these are more than atoned for by her pure fresh view of life and her altogether unfashionable regard for the readers moral susceptibilities let no one be induced by its distinctly misleading title to forego the enjoyment of this pleasant picture of domestic life which in spite of a total lack of force in characterdrawing and of consecutiveness in incident may be described as a distinctly pretty story iii it was several weeks later that mrs clinch once more brought the plebeian aroma of heated tramcars and muddy streetcrossings into the violetscented atmosphere of her cousins drawingroom well she said tossing a damp bundle of proof into the corner of a silkcushioned bergere ive read it at last and im not so awfully shocked mrs fetherel who sat near the fire with her head propped on a languid hand looked up without speaking mercy paula said her visitor youre ill mrs fetherel shook her head i was never better she said mournfully then may i help myself to tea thanks mrs clinch carefully removed her mended glove before taking a buttered teacake then she glanced again at her cousin its not what i said just now she ventured just now about fast and loose i came to talk it over mrs fetherel sprang to her feet i never she cried dramatically want to hear it mentioned again paula exclaimed mrs clinch setting down her cup mrs fetherel slowly turned on her an eye brimming with the incommunicable then dropping into her seat again she added with a tragic laugh theres nothing left to say nothing faltered mrs clinch longing for another teacake but feeling the inappropriateness of the impulse in an atmosphere so charged with the portentous do you mean that everything has been said she looked tentatively at her cousin havent they been nice theyve been odious odious mrs fetherel burst out with an ineffectual clutch at her handkerchief its been perfectly intolerable mrs clinch philosophically resigning herself to the propriety of taking no more tea crossed over to her cousin and laid a sympathizing hand on that ladys agitated shoulder it is a bore at first she conceded but youll be surprised to see how soon one gets used to it i shall never get used to it mrs fetherel brokenly declared have they been so very nasty all of them every one of them the novelist sobbed im so sorry dear it does hurt i know but hadnt you rather expected it expected it cried mrs fetherel sitting up mrs clinch felt her way warily i only mean dear that i fancied from what you said before the book came out that you rather expected that youd rather discounted their recommending it to everybody as a perfectly harmless story good gracious is that what theyve done mrs fetherel speechlessly nodded every one of them every one whew said mrs clinch with an incipient whistle why youve just said it yourself her cousin suddenly reproached her said what that you werent so awfully shocked i oh well you see youd keyed me up to such a pitch that it wasnt quite as bad as i expected mrs fetherel lifted a smile steeled for the worst why not say at once she suggested that its a distinctly pretty story they havent said that theyve all said it my poor paula even the bishop the bishop called it a pretty story he wrote me ive his letter somewhere the title rather scared him he wanted me to change it but when hed read the book he wrote that it was all right and that hed sent several copies to his friends the old hypocrite cried mrs clinch that was nothing but professional jealousy do you think so cried her cousin brightening sure of it my dear his own books dont sell and he knew the quickest way to kill yours was to distribute it through the diocese with his blessing then you dont really think its a pretty story dear me no not nearly as bad as that youre so good bella but the reviewers oh the reviewers mrs clinch jeered she gazed meditatively at the cold remains of her teacake let me see she said suddenly do you happen to remember if the first review came out in an important paper yes the radiator thats it i thought so then the others simply followed suit they often do if a big paper sets the pace saves a lot of trouble now if you could only have got the radiator to denounce you thats what the bishop said cried mrs fetherel he did he said his only chance of selling through a glass brightly was to have it denounced on the ground of immorality hm said mrs clinch i thought he knew a trick or two she turned an illuminated eye on her cousin you ought to get him to denounce fast and loose she cried mrs fetherel looked at her suspiciously i suppose every book must stand or fall on its own merits she said in an unconvinced tone bosh that view is as extinct as the postchaise and the packetship it belongs to the time when people read books nobody does that now the reviewer was the first to set the example and the public were only too thankful to follow it at first they read the reviews now they read only the publishers extracts from them even these are rapidly being replaced by paragraphs borrowed from the vocabulary of commerce i often have to look twice before i am sure if i am reading a departmentstore advertisement or the announcement of a new batch of literature the publishers will soon be having their fall and spring openings and their special importations for horseshow week but the bishop is right of course nothing helps a book like a rousing attack on its morals and as the publishers cant exactly proclaim the impropriety of their own wares the task has to be left to the press or the pulpit the pulpit mrs fetherel mused why yes look at those two novels in england last year mrs fetherel shook her head hopelessly there is so much more interest in literature in england than here well weve got to make the supply create the demand the bishop could run your novel up into the hundred thousands in no time but if he cant make his own sell my dear a man cant very well preach against his own writings mrs clinch rose and picked up her proofs im awfully sorry for you paula dear she concluded but i cant help being thankful that theres no demand for pessimism in the field of natural history fancy having to write the fall of a sparrow or how the plants misbehave iv mrs fetherel driving up to the grand central station one morning about five months later caught sight of the distinguished novelist archer hynes hurrying into the waitingroom ahead of her hynes on his side recognizing her brougham turned back to greet her as the footman opened the carriagedoor my dear colleague is it possible that we are traveling together mrs fetherel blushed with pleasure hynes had given her two columns of praise in the sunday meteor and she had not yet learned to disguise her gratitude i am going to ossining she said smilingly so am i why this is almost as good as an elopement and it will end where elopements ought to in church in church youre not going to ossining to go to church why not theres a special ceremony in the cathedral the chantry window is to be unveiled the chantry window how picturesque what is a chantry and why do you want to see it unveiled are you after copy doing something in the huysmans manner la cathedrale eh oh no mrs fetherel hesitated im going simply to please my uncle she said at last your uncle the bishop you know she smiled the bishop the bishop of ossining why wasnt he the chap who made that ridiculous attack on your book is that prehistoric ass your uncle upon my soul i think youre mighty forgiving to travel all the way to ossining for one of his stainedglass sociables mrs fetherels smile flowed into a gentle laugh oh ive never allowed that to interfere with our friendship my uncle felt dreadfully about having to speak publicly against my book it was a great deal harder for him than for me but he thought it his duty to do so he has the very highest sense of duty well said hynes with a shrug i dont know that he didnt do you a good turn look at that they were standing near the bookstall and he pointed to a placard surmounting the counter and emblazoned with the conspicuous announcement fast and loose new edition with authors portrait hundred and fiftieth thousand mrs fetherel frowned impatiently how absurd theyve no right to use my picture as a poster theres our train said hynes and they began to push their way through the crowd surging toward one of the inner doors as they stood wedged between circumferent shoulders mrs fetherel became conscious of the fixed stare of a pretty girl who whispered eagerly to her companion look myrtle thats paula fetherel right behind us i knew her in a minute gracious where cried the other girl giving her head a twist which swept her gainsborough plumes across mrs fetherels face the first speakers words had carried beyond her companions ear and a lemoncolored woman in spectacles who clutched a copy of the journal of psychology on one drabcottongloved hand stretched her disengaged hand across the intervening barrier of humanity have i the privilege of addressing the distinguished author of fast and loose if so let me thank you in the name of the womans psychological league of peoria for your magnificent courage in raising the standard of revolt against you can tell us the rest in the car said a fat man pressing his goodhumored bulk against the speakers arm mrs fetherel blushing embarrassed and happy slipped into the space produced by this displacement and a few moments later had taken her seat in the train she was a little late and the other chairs were already filled by a company of elderly ladies and clergymen who seemed to belong to the same party and were still busy exchanging greetings and settling themselves in their places one of the ladies at mrs fetherels approach uttered an exclamation of pleasure and advanced with outstretched hand my dear mrs fetherel i am so delighted to see you here may i hope you are going to the unveiling of the chantry window the dear bishop so hoped that you would do so but perhaps i ought to introduce myself i am mrs gollinger she lowered her voice expressively one of your uncles oldest friends one who has stood close to him through all this sad business and who knows what he suffered when he felt obliged to sacrifice family affection to the call of duty mrs fetherel who had smiled and colored slightly at the beginning of this speech received its close with a deprecating gesture oh pray dont mention it she murmured i quite understood how my uncle was placed i bore him no ill will for feeling obliged to preach against my book he understood that and was so touched by it he has often told me that it was the hardest task he was ever called upon to perform and do you know he quite feels that this unexpected gift of the chantry window is in some way a return for his courage in preaching that sermon mrs fetherel smiled faintly does he feel that yes he really does when the funds for the window were so mysteriously placed at his disposal just as he had begun to despair of raising them he assured me that he could not help connecting the fact with his denunciation of your book dear uncle sighed mrs fetherel did he say that and now continued mrs gollinger with cumulative rapture now that you are about to show by appearing at the ceremony today that there has been no break in your friendly relations the dear bishops happiness will be complete he was so longing to have you come to the unveiling he might have counted on me said mrs fetherel still smiling ah that is so beautifully forgiving of you cried mrs gollinger enthusiastically but then the bishop has always assured me that your real nature was very different from that which if you will pardon my saying so seems to be revealed by your brilliant but er rather subversive book if you only knew my niece dear mrs gollinger he always said you would see that her novel was written in all innocence of heart and to tell you the truth when i first read the book i didnt think it so very very shocking it wasnt till the dear bishop had explained tome but dear me i mustnt take up your time in this way when so many others are anxious to have a word with you mrs fetherel glanced at her in surprise and mrs gollinger continued with a playful smile you forget that your face is familiar to thousands whom you have never seen we all recognized you the moment you entered the train and my friends here are so eager to make your acquaintance even those her smile deepened who thought the dear bishop not quite unjustified in his attack on your remarkable novel v a religious light filled the chantry of ossining cathedral filtering through the linen curtain which veiled the central window and mingling with the blaze of tapers on the richly adorned altar in this devout atmosphere agreeably laden with the incenselike aroma of easter lilies and forced lilacs mrs fetherel knelt with a sense of luxurious satisfaction beside her sat archer hynes who had remembered that there was to be a church scene in his next novel and that his impressions of the devotional environment needed refreshing mrs fetherel was very happy she was conscious that her entrance had sent a thrill through the female devotees who packed the chantry and she had humor enough to enjoy the thought that but for the good bishops denunciation of her book the heads of his flock would not have been turned so eagerly in her direction moreover as she had entered she had caught sight of a society reporter and she knew that her presence and the fact that she was accompanied by hynes would be conspicuously proclaimed in the morning papers all these evidences of the success of her handiwork might have turned a calmer head than mrs fetherels and though she had now learned to dissemble her gratification it still filled her inwardly with a delightful glow the bishop was somewhat late in appearing and she employed the interval in meditating on the plot of her next novel which was already partly sketched out but for which she had been unable to find a satisfactory denouement by a not uncommon process of ratiocination mrs fetherels success had convinced her of her vocation she was sure now that it was her duty to lay bare the secret plaguespots of society and she was resolved that there should be no doubt as to the purpose of her new book experience had shown her that where she had fancied she was calling a spade a spade she had in fact been alluding in guarded terms to the drawingroom shovel she was determined not to repeat the same mistake and she flattered herself that her coming novel would not need an episcopal denunciation to insure its sale however likely it was to receive this crowning evidence of success she had reached this point in her meditations when the choir burst into song and the ceremony of the unveiling began the bishop almost always felicitous in his addresses to the fair sex was never more so than when he was celebrating the triumph of one of his cherished purposes there was a peculiar mixture of christian humility and episcopal exultation in the manner with which he called attention to the creators promptness in responding to his demand for funds and he had never been more happily inspired than in eulogizing the mysterious gift of the chantry window though no hint of the donors identity had been allowed to escape him it was generally understood that the bishop knew who had given the window and the congregation awaited in a flutter of suspense the possible announcement of a name none came however though the bishop deliciously titillated the curiosity of his flock by circling ever closer about the interesting secret he would not disguise from them he said that the heart which had divined his inmost wish had been a womans is it not to womans intuitions that more than half the happiness of earth is owing what man is obliged to learn by the laborious process of experience womans wondrous instinct tells her at a glance and so it had been with this cherished scheme this unhopedfor completion of their beautiful chantry so much at least he was allowed to reveal and indeed had he not done so the window itself would have spoken for him since the first glance at its touching subject and exquisite design would show it to have originated in a womans heart this tribute to the sex was received with an audible sigh of contentment and the bishop always stimulated by such evidence of his sway over his hearers took up his theme with gathering eloquence yes a womans heart had planned the gift a womans hand had executed it and might he add without too far withdrawing the veil in which christian beneficence ever loved to drape its acts might he add that under providence a book a simple book a mere tale in fact had had its share in the good work for which they were assembled to give thanks at this unexpected announcement a ripple of excitement ran through the assemblage and more than one head was abruptly turned in the direction of mrs fetherel who sat listening in an agony of wonder and confusion it did not escape the observant novelist at her side that she drew down her veil to conceal an uncontrollable blush and this evidence of dismay caused him to fix an attentive gaze on her while from her seat across the aisle mrs gollinger sent a smile of unctuous approval a book a simple book the bishops voice went on above this flutter of mingled emotions what is a book only a few pages and a little ink and yet one of the mightiest instruments which providence has devised for shaping the destinies of man one of the most powerful influences for good or evil which the creator has placed in the hands of his creatures the air seemed intolerably close to mrs fetherel and she drew out her scentbottle and then thrust it hurriedly away conscious that she was still the center of an unenviable attention and all the while the bishops voice droned on and of all forms of literature fiction is doubtless that which has exercised the greatest sway for good or ill over the passions and imagination of the masses yes my friends i am the first to acknowledge it no sermon however eloquent no theological treatise however learned and convincing has ever inflamed the heart and imagination like a novel a simple novel incalculable is the power exercised over humanity by the great magicians of the pen a power ever enlarging its boundaries and increasing its responsibilities as popular education multiplies the number of readersyes it is the novelists hand which can pour balm on countless human sufferings or inoculate mankind with the festering poison of a corrupt imagination mrs fetherel had turned white and her eyes were fixed with a blind stare of anger on the largesleeved figure in the center of the chancel and too often alas it is the poison and not the balm which the unscrupulous hand of genius proffers to its unsuspecting readers but my friends why should i continue none know better than an assemblage of christian women such as i am now addressing the beneficent or baleful influences of modern fiction and so when i say that this beautiful chantry window of ours owes its existence in part to the romancers pen the bishop paused and bending forward seemed to seek a certain face among the countenances eagerly addressed to his when i say that this pen which for personal reasons it does not become me to celebrate unduly mrs fetherel at this point half rose pushing back her chair which scraped loudly over the marble floor but hynes involuntarily laid a warning hand on her arm and she sank down with a confused murmur about the heat when i confess that this pen which for once at least has proved itself so much mightier than the sword is that which was inspired to trace the simple narrative of through a glass brightly mrs fetherel looked up with a gasp of mingled relief and anger when i tell you my dear friends that it was your bishops own work which first roused the mind of one of his flock to the crying need of a chantry window i think you will admit that i am justified in celebrating the triumphs of the pen even though it be the modest instrument which your own bishop wields the bishop paused impressively and a faint gasp of surprise and disappointment was audible throughout the chantry something very different from this conclusion had been expected and even mrs gollingers lips curled with a slightly ironic smile but archer hyness attention was chiefly reserved for mrs fetherel whose face had changed with astonishing rapidity from surprise to annoyance from annoyance to relief and then back again to something very like indignation the address concluded the actual ceremony of the unveiling was about to take place and the attention of the congregation soon reverted to the chancel where the choir had grouped themselves beneath the veiled window prepared to burst into a chant of praise as the bishop drew back the hanging the moment was an impressive one and every eye was fixed on the curtain even hyness gaze strayed to it for a moment but soon returned to his neighbors face and then he perceived that mrs fetherel alone of all the persons present was not looking at the window her eyes were fixed in an indignant stare on the bishop a flush of anger burned becomingly under her veil and her hands nervously crumpled the beautifully printed program of the ceremony hynes broke into a smile of comprehension he glanced at the bishop and back at the bishops niece then as the episcopal hand was solemnly raised to draw back the curtain he bent and whispered in mrs fetherels ear why you gave it yourself you wonderful woman of course you gave it yourself mrs fetherel raised her eyes to his with a start her blush deepened and her lips shaped a hasty no but the denial was deflected into the indignant murmur it wasnt his silly book that did it anyhow the ladys maids bell i it was the autumn after i had the typhoid id been three months in hospital and when i came out i looked so weak and tottery that the two or three ladies i applied to were afraid to engage me most of my money was gone and after id boarded for two months hanging about the employmentagencies and answering any advertisement that looked any way respectable i pretty nearly lost heart for fretting hadnt made me fatter and i didnt see why my luck should ever turn it did though or i thought so at the time a mrs railton a friend of the lady that first brought me out to the states met me one day and stopped to speak to me she was one that had always a friendly way with her she asked me what ailed me to look so white and when i told her why hartley says she i believe ive got the very place for you come in tomorrow and well talk about it the next day when i called she told me the lady shed in mind was a niece of hers a mrs brympton a youngish lady but something of an invalid who lived all the year round at her countryplace on the hudson owing to not being able to stand the fatigue of town life now hartley mrs railton said in that cheery way that always made me feel things must be going to take a turn for the better now understand me its not a cheerful place im sending you to the house is big and gloomy my niece is nervous vaporish her husband well hes generally away and the two children are dead a year ago i would as soon have thought of shutting a rosy active girl like you into a vault but youre not particularly brisk yourself just now are you and a quiet place with country air and wholesome food and early hours ought to be the very thing for you dont mistake me she added for i suppose i looked a trifle downcast you may find it dull but you wont be unhappy my niece is an angel her former maid who died last spring had been with her twenty years and worshipped the ground she walked on shes a kind mistress to all and where the mistress is kind as you know the servants are generally goodhumored so youll probably get on well enough with the rest of the household and youre the very woman i want for my niece quiet wellmannered and educated above your station you read aloud well i think thats a good thing my niece likes to be read to she wants a maid that can be something of a companion her last was and i cant say how she misses her its a lonely lifewell have you decided why maam i said im not afraid of solitude well then go my niece will take you on my recommendation ill telegraph her at once and you can take the afternoon train she has no one to wait on her at present and i dont want you to lose any time i was ready enough to start yet something in me hung back and to gain time i asked and the gentleman maam the gentlemans almost always away i tell you said mrs ralston quicklike and when hes there says she suddenly youve only to keep out of his way i took the afternoon train and got out at dstation at about four oclock a groom in a dogcart was waiting and we drove off at a smart pace it was a dull october day with rain hanging close overhead and by the time we turned into the brympton place woods the daylight was almost gone the drive wound through the woods for a mile or two and came out on a gravel court shut in with thickets of tall blacklooking shrubs there were no lights in the windows and the house did look a bit gloomy i had asked no questions of the groom for i never was one to get my notion of new masters from their other servants i prefer to wait and see for myself but i could tell by the look of everything that i had got into the right kind of house and that things were done handsomely a pleasantfaced cook met me at the back door and called the housemaid to show me up to my room youll see madam later she said mrs brympton has a visitor i hadnt fancied mrs brympton was a lady to have many visitors and somehow the words cheered me i followed the housemaid upstairs and saw through a door on the upper landing that the main part of the house seemed wellfurnished with dark panelling and a number of old portraits another flight of stairs led us up to the servants wing it was almost dark now and the housemaid excused herself for not having brought a light but theres matches in your room she said and if you go careful youll be all right mind the step at the end of the passage your room is just beyond i looked ahead as she spoke and halfway down the passage i saw a woman standing she drew back into a doorway as we passed and the housemaid didnt appear to notice her she was a thin woman with a white face and a darkish stuff gown and apron i took her for the housekeeper and thought it odd that she didnt speak but just gave me a long look as she went by my room opened into a square hall at the end of the passage facing my door was another which stood open the housemaid exclaimed when she saw it there mrs blinders left that door open again said she closing it is mrs blinder the housekeeper theres no housekeeper mrs blinders the cook and is that her room laws no said the housemaid crosslike thats nobodys room its empty i mean and the door hadnt ought to be open mrs brympton wants it kept locked she opened my door and led me into a neat room nicely furnished with a picture or two on the walls and having lit a candle she took leave telling me that the servantshall tea was at six and that mrs brympton would see me afterward i found them a pleasantspoken set in the servants hall and by what they let fall i gathered that as mrs railton had said mrs brympton was the kindest of ladies but i didnt take much notice of their talk for i was watching to see the pale woman in the dark gown come in she didnt show herself however and i wondered if she ate apart but if she wasnt the housekeeper why should she suddenly it struck me that she might be a trained nurse and in that case her meals would of course be served in her room if mrs brympton was an invalid it was likely enough she had a nurse the idea annoyed me i own for theyre not always the easiest to get on with and if id known i shouldnt have taken the place but there i was and there was no use pulling a long face over it and not being one to ask questions i waited to see what would turn up when tea was over the housemaid said to the footman has mr ranford gone and when he said yes she told me to come up with her to mrs brympton mrs brympton was lying down in her bedroom her lounge stood near the fire and beside it was a shaded lamp she was a delicatelooking lady but when she smiled i felt there was nothing i wouldnt do for her she spoke very pleasantly in a low voice asking me my name and age and so on and if i had everything i wanted and if i wasnt afraid of feeling lonely in the country not with you i wouldnt be madam i said and the words surprised me when id spoken them for im not an impulsive person but it was just as if id thought aloud she seemed pleased at that and said she hoped id continue in the same mind then she gave me a few directions about her toilet and said agnes the housemaid would show me next morning where things were kept i am tired tonight and shall dine upstairs she said agnes will bring me my tray that you may have time to unpack and settle yourself and later you may come and undress me very well maam i said youll ring i suppose i thought she looked odd no agnes will fetch you says she quickly and took up her book again well that was certainly strange a ladys maid having to be fetched by the housemaid whenever her lady wanted her i wondered if there were no bells in the house but the next day i satisfied myself that there was one in every room and a special one ringing from my mistresss room to mine and after that it did strike me as queer that whenever mrs brympton wanted anything she rang for agnes who had to walk the whole length of the servants wing to call me but that wasnt the only queer thing in the house the very next day i found out that mrs brympton had no nurse and then i asked agnes about the woman i had seen in the passage the afternoon before agnes said she had seen no one and i saw that she thought i was dreaming to be sure it was dusk when we went down the passage and she had excused herself for not bringing a light but i had seen the woman plain enough to know her again if we should meet i decided that she must have been a friend of the cooks or of one of the other womenservants perhaps she had come down from town for a nights visit and the servants wanted it kept secret some ladies are very stiff about having their servants friends in the house overnight at any rate i made up my mind to ask no more questions in a day or two another odd thing happened i was chatting one afternoon with mrs blinder who was a friendly disposed woman and had been longer in the house than the other servants and she asked me if i was quite comfortable and had everything i needed i said i had no fault to find with my place or with my mistress but i thought it odd that in so large a house there was no sewingroom for the ladys maid why says she there is one the room youre in is the old sewingroom oh said i and where did the other ladys maid sleep at that she grew confused and said hurriedly that the servants rooms had all been changed about last year and she didnt rightly remember that struck me as peculiar but i went on as if i hadnt noticed well theres a vacant room opposite mine and i mean to ask mrs brympton if i maynt use that as a sewingroom to my astonishment mrs blinder went white and gave my hand a kind of squeeze dont do that my dear said she tremblinglike to tell you the truth that was emma saxons room and my mistress has kept it closed ever since her death and who was emma saxon mrs brymptons former maid the one that was with her so many years said i remembering what mrs railton had told me mrs blinder nodded what sort of woman was she no better walked the earth said mrs blinder my mistress loved her like a sister but i mean what did she look like mrs blinder got up and gave me a kind of angry stare im no great hand at describing she said and i believe my pastrys rising and she walked off into the kitchen and shut the door after her ii i had been near a week at brympton before i saw my master word came that he was arriving one afternoon and a change passed over the whole household it was plain that nobody loved him below stairs mrs blinder took uncommon care with the dinner that night but she snapped at the kitchenmaid in a way quite unusual with her and mr wace the butler a serious slowspoken man went about his duties as if hed been getting ready for a funeral he was a great biblereader mr wace was and had a beautiful assortment of texts at his command but that day he used such dreadful language that i was about to leave the table when he assured me it was all out of isaiah and i noticed that whenever the master came mr wace took to the prophets about seven agnes called me to my mistresss room and there i found mr brympton he was standing on the hearth a big fair bullnecked man with a red face and little badtempered blue eyes the kind of man a young simpleton might have thought handsome and would have been like to pay dear for thinking it he swung about when i came in and looked me over in a trice i knew what the look meant from having experienced it once or twice in my former places then he turned his back on me and went on talking to his wife and i knew what that meant too i was not the kind of morsel he was after the typhoid had served me well enough in one way it kept that kind of gentleman at armslength this is my new maid hartley says mrs brympton in her kind voice and he nodded and went on with what he was saying in a minute or two he went off and left my mistress to dress for dinner and i noticed as i waited on her that she was white and chill to the touch mr brympton took himself off the next morning and the whole house drew a long breath when he drove away as for my mistress she put on her hat and furs for it was a fine winter morning and went out for a walk in the gardens coming back quite fresh and rosy so that for a minute before her color faded i could guess what a pretty young lady she must have been and not so long ago either she had met mr ranford in the grounds and the two came back together i remember smiling and talking as they walked along the terrace under my window that was the first time i saw mr ranford though i had often heard his name mentioned in the hall he was a neighbor it appeared living a mile or two beyond brympton at the end of the village and as he was in the habit of spending his winters in the country he was almost the only company my mistress had at that season he was a slight tall gentleman of about thirty and i thought him rather melancholylooking till i saw his smile which had a kind of surprise in it like the first warm day in spring he was a great reader i heard like my mistress and the two were forever borrowing books of one another and sometimes mr wace told me he would read aloud to mrs brympton by the hour in the big dark library where she sat in the winter afternoons the servants all liked him and perhaps thats more of a compliment than the masters suspect he had a friendly word for every one of us and we were all glad to think that mrs brympton had a pleasant companionable gentleman like that to keep her company when the master was away mr ranford seemed on excellent terms with mr brympton too though i couldnt but wonder that two gentlemen so unlike each other should be so friendly but then i knew how the real quality can keep their feelings to themselves as for mr brympton he came and went never staying more than a day or two cursing the dulness and the solitude grumbling at everything and as i soon found out drinking a deal more than was good for him after mrs brympton left the table he would sit half the night over the old brympton port and madeira and once as i was leaving my mistresss room rather later than usual i met him coming up the stairs in such a state that i turned sick to think of what some ladies have to endure and hold their tongues about the servants said very little about their master but from what they let drop i could see it had been an unhappy match from the beginning mr brympton was coarse loud and pleasureloving my mistress quiet retiring and perhaps a trifle cold not that she was not always pleasantspoken to him i thought her wonderfully forbearing but to a gentleman as free as mr brympton i daresay she seemed a little offish well things went on quietly for several weeks my mistress was kind my duties were light and i got on well with the other servants in short i had nothing to complain of yet there was always a weight on me i cant say why it was so but i know it was not the loneliness that i felt i soon got used to that and being still languid from the fever i was thankful for the quiet and the good country air nevertheless i was never quite easy in my mind my mistress knowing i had been ill insisted that i should take my walk regular and often invented errands for me a yard of ribbon to be fetched from the village a letter posted or a book returned to mr ranford as soon as i was out of doors my spirits rose and i looked forward to my walks through the bare moistsmelling woods but the moment i caught sight of the house again my heart dropped down like a stone in a well it was not a gloomy house exactly yet i never entered it but a feeling of gloom came over me mrs brympton seldom went out in winter only on the finest days did she walk an hour at noon on the south terrace excepting mr ranford we had no visitors but the doctor who drove over from d about once a week he sent for me once or twice to give me some trifling direction about my mistress and though he never told me what her illness was i thought from a waxy look she had now and then of a morning that it might be the heart that ailed her the season was soft and unwholesome and in january we had a long spell of rain that was a sore trial to me i own for i couldnt go out and sitting over my sewing all day listening to the drip drip of the eaves i grew so nervous that the least sound made me jump somehow the thought of that locked room across the passage began to weigh on me once or twice in the long rainy nights i fancied i heard noises there but that was nonsense of course and the daylight drove such notions out of my head well one morning mrs brympton gave me quite a start of pleasure by telling me she wished me to go to town for some shopping i hadnt known till then how low my spirits had fallen i set off in high glee and my first sight of the crowded streets and the cheerfullooking shops quite took me out of myself toward afternoon however the noise and confusion began to tire me and i was actually looking forward to the quiet of brympton and thinking how i should enjoy the drive home through the dark woods when i ran across an old acquaintance a maid i had once been in service with we had lost sight of each other for a number of years and i had to stop and tell her what had happened to me in the interval when i mentioned where i was living she rolled up her eyes and pulled a long face what the mrs brympton that lives all the year at her place on the hudson my dear you wont stay there three months oh but i dont mind the country says i offended somehow at her tone since the fever im glad to be quiet she shook her head its not the country im thinking of all i know is shes had four maids in the last six months and the last one who was a friend of mine told me nobody could stay in the house did she say why i asked no she wouldnt give me her reason but she says to me mrs ansey she says if ever a young woman as you know of thinks of going there you tell her its not worth while to unpack her boxes is she young and handsome said i thinking of mr brympton not her shes the kind that mothers engage when theyve gay young gentlemen at college well though i knew the woman was an idle gossip the words stuck in my head and my heart sank lower than ever as i drove up to brympton in the dusk there was something about the house i was sure of it now when i went in to tea i heard that mr brympton had arrived and i saw at a glance that there had been a disturbance of some kind mrs blinders hand shook so that she could hardly pour the tea and mr wace quoted the most dreadful texts full of brimstone nobody said a word to me then but when i went up to my room mrs blinder followed me oh my dear says she taking my hand im so glad and thankful youve come back to us that struck me as you may imagine why said i did you think i was leaving for good no no to be sure said she a little confused but i cant abear to have madam left alone for a day even she pressed my hand hard and oh miss hartley says she be good to your mistress as youre a christian woman and with that she hurried away and left me staring a moment later agnes called me to mrs brympton hearing mr brymptons voice in her room i went round by the dressingroom thinking i would lay out her dinnergown before going in the dressingroom is a large room with a window over the portico that looks toward the gardens mr brymptons apartments are beyond when i went in the door into the bedroom was ajar and i heard mr brympton saying angrily one would suppose he was the only person fit for you to talk to i dont have many visitors in winter mrs brympton answered quietly you have me he flung at her sneering you are here so seldom said she well whose fault is that you make the place about as lively as a family vault with that i rattled the toiletthings to give my mistress warning and she rose and called me in the two dined alone as usual and i knew by mr waces manner at supper that things must be going badly he quoted the prophets something terrible and worked on the kitchenmaid so that she declared she wouldnt go down alone to put the cold meat in the icebox i felt nervous myself and after i had put my mistress to bed i was halftempted to go down again and persuade mrs blinder to sit up awhile over a game of cards but i heard her door closing for the night and so i went on to my own room the rain had begun again and the drip drip drip seemed to be dropping into my brain i lay awake listening to it and turning over what my friend in town had said what puzzled me was that it was always the maids who left after a while i slept but suddenly a loud noise wakened me my bell had rung i sat up terrified by the unusual sound which seemed to go on jangling through the darkness my hands shook so that i couldnt find the matches at length i struck a light and jumped out of bed i began to think i must have been dreaming but i looked at the bell against the wall and there was the little hammer still quivering i was just beginning to huddle on my clothes when i heard another sound this time it was the door of the locked room opposite mine softly opening and closing i heard the sound distinctly and it frightened me so that i stood stock still then i heard a footstep hurrying down the passage toward the main house the floor being carpeted the sound was very faint but i was quite sure it was a womans step i turned cold with the thought of it and for a minute or two i dursnt breathe or move then i came to my senses alice hartley says i to myself someone left that room just now and ran down the passage ahead of you the idea isnt pleasant but you may as well face it your mistress has rung for you and to answer her bell youve got to go the way that other woman has gone well i did it i never walked faster in my life yet i thought i should never get to the end of the passage or reach mrs brymptons room on the way i heard nothing and saw nothing all was dark and quiet as the grave when i reached my mistresss door the silence was so deep that i began to think i must be dreaming and was halfminded to turn back then a panic seized me and i knocked there was no answer and i knocked again loudly to my astonishment the door was opened by mr brympton he started back when he saw me and in the light of my candle his face looked red and savage you he said in a queer voice how many of you are there in gods name at that i felt the ground give under me but i said to myself that he had been drinking and answered as steadily as i could may i go in sir mrs brympton has rung for me you may all go in for what i care says he and pushing by me walked down the hall to his own bedroom i looked after him as he went and to my surprise i saw that he walked as straight as a sober man i found my mistress lying very weak and still but she forced a smile when she saw me and signed to me to pour out some drops for her after that she lay without speaking her breath coming quick and her eyes closed suddenly she groped out with her hand and emma says she faintly its hartley madam i said do you want anything she opened her eyes wide and gave me a startled look i was dreaming she said you may go now hartley and thank you kindly im quite well again you see and she turned her face away from me iii there was no more sleep for me that night and i was thankful when daylight came soon afterward agnes called me to mrs brympton i was afraid she was ill again for she seldom sent for me before nine but i found her sitting up in bed pale and drawnlooking but quite herself hartley says she quickly will you put on your things at once and go down to the village for me i want this prescription made up here she hesitated a minute and blushed and i should like you to be back again before mr brympton is up certainly madam i said and stay a moment she called me back as if an idea had just struck her while youre waiting for the mixture youll have time to go on to mr ranfords with this note it was a twomile walk to the village and on my way i had time to turn things over in my mind it struck me as peculiar that my mistress should wish the prescription made up without mr brymptons knowledge and putting this together with the scene of the night before and with much else that i had noticed and suspected i began to wonder if the poor lady was weary of her life and had come to the mad resolve of ending it the idea took such hold on me that i reached the village on a run and dropped breathless into a chair before the chemists counter the good man who was just taking down his shutters stared at me so hard that it brought me to myself mr limmel i says trying to speak indifferent will you run your eye over this and tell me if its quite right he put on his spectacles and studied the prescription why its one of dr waltons says he what should be wrong with it well is it dangerous to take dangerous how do you mean i could have shaken the man for his stupidity i mean if a person was to take too much of it by mistake of course says i my heart in my throat lord bless you no its only limewater you might feed it to a baby by the bottleful i gave a great sigh of relief and hurried on to mr ranfords but on the way another thought struck me if there was nothing to conceal about my visit to the chemists was it my other errand that mrs brympton wished me to keep private somehow that thought frightened me worse than the other yet the two gentlemen seemed fast friends and i would have staked my head on my mistresss goodness i felt ashamed of my suspicions and concluded that i was still disturbed by the strange events of the night i left the note at mr ranfords and hurrying back to brympton slipped in by a side door without being seen as i thought an hour later however as i was carrying in my mistresss breakfast i was stopped in the hall by mr brympton what were you doing out so early he says looking hard at me early me sir i said in a tremble come come he says an angry red spot coming out on his forehead didnt i see you scuttling home through the shrubbery an hour or more ago im a truthful woman by nature but at that a lie popped out readymade no sir you didnt said i and looked straight back at him he shrugged his shoulders and gave a sullen laugh i suppose you think i was drunk last night he asked suddenly no sir i dont i answered this time truthfully enough he turned away with another shrug a pretty notion my servants have of me i heard him mutter as he walked off not till i had settled down to my afternoons sewing did i realize how the events of the night had shaken me i couldnt pass that locked door without a shiver i knew i had heard someone come out of it and walk down the passage ahead of me i thought of speaking to mrs blinder or to mr wace the only two in the house who appeared to have an inkling of what was going on but i had a feeling that if i questioned them they would deny everything and that i might learn more by holding my tongue and keeping my eyes open the idea of spending another night opposite the locked room sickened me and once i was seized with the notion of packing my trunk and taking the first train to town but it wasnt in me to throw over a kind mistress in that manner and i tried to go on with my sewing as if nothing had happened i hadnt worked ten minutes before the sewingmachine broke down it was one i had found in the house a good machine but a trifle out of order mrs blinder said it had never been used since emma saxons death i stopped to see what was wrong and as i was working at the machine a drawer which i had never been able to open slid forward and a photograph fell out i picked it up and sat looking at it in a maze it was a womans likeness and i knew i had seen the face somewhere the eyes had an asking look that i had felt on me before and suddenly i remembered the pale woman in the passage i stood up cold all over and ran out of the room my heart seemed to be thumping in the top of my head and i felt as if i should never get away from the look in those eyes i went straight to mrs blinder she was taking her afternoon nap and sat up with a jump when i came in mrs blinder said i who is that and i held out the photograph she rubbed her eyes and stared why emma saxon says she where did you find it i looked hard at her for a minute mrs blinder i said ive seen that face before mrs blinder got up and walked over to the lookingglass dear me i must have been asleep she says my front is all over one ear and now do run along miss hartley dear for i hear the clock striking four and i must go down this very minute and put on the virginia ham for mr brymptons dinner iv to all appearances things went on as usual for a week or two the only difference was that mr brympton stayed on instead of going off as he usually did and that mr ranford never showed himself i heard mr brympton remark on this one afternoon when he was sitting in my mistresss room before dinner wheres ranford says he he hasnt been near the house for a week does he keep away because im here mrs brympton spoke so low that i couldnt catch her answer well he went on twos company and threes trumpery im sorry to be in ranfords way and i suppose i shall have to take myself off again in a day or two and give him a show and he laughed at his own joke the very next day as it happened mr ranford called the footman said the three were very merry over their tea in the library and mr brympton strolled down to the gate with mr ranford when he left i have said that things went on as usual and so they did with the rest of the household but as for myself i had never been the same since the night my bell had rung night after night i used to lie awake listening for it to ring again and for the door of the locked room to open stealthily but the bell never rang and i heard no sound across the passage at last the silence began to be more dreadful to me than the most mysterious sounds i felt that someone were cowering there behind the locked door watching and listening as i watched and listened and i could almost have cried out whoever you are come out and let me see you face to face but dont lurk there and spy on me in the darkness feeling as i did you may wonder i didnt give warning once i very nearly did so but at the last moment something held me back whether it was compassion for my mistress who had grown more and more dependent on me or unwillingness to try a new place or some other feeling that i couldnt put a name to i lingered on as if spellbound though every night was dreadful to me and the days but little better for one thing i didnt like mrs brymptons looks she had never been the same since that night no more than i had i thought she would brighten up after mr brympton left but though she seemed easier in her mind her spirits didnt revive nor her strength either she had grown attached to me and seemed to like to have me about and agnes told me one day that since emma saxons death i was the only maid her mistress had taken to this gave me a warm feeling for the poor lady though after all there was little i could do to help her after mr brymptons departure mr ranford took to coming again though less often than formerly i met him once or twice in the grounds or in the village and i couldnt but think there was a change in him too but i set it down to my disordered fancy the weeks passed and mr brympton had now been a month absent we heard he was cruising with a friend in the west indies and mr wace said that was a long way off but though you had the wings of a dove and went to the uttermost parts of the earth you couldnt get away from the almighty agnes said that as long as he stayed away from brympton the almighty might have him and welcome and this raised a laugh though mrs blinder tried to look shocked and mr wace said the bears would eat us we were all glad to hear that the west indies were a long way off and i remember that in spite of mr waces solemn looks we had a very merry dinner that day in the hall i dont know if it was because of my being in better spirits but i fancied mrs brympton looked better too and seemed more cheerful in her manner she had been for a walk in the morning and after luncheon she lay down in her room and i read aloud to her when she dismissed me i went to my own room feeling quite bright and happy and for the first time in weeks walked past the locked door without thinking of it as i sat down to my work i looked out and saw a few snowflakes falling the sight was pleasanter than the eternal rain and i pictured to myself how pretty the bare gardens would look in their white mantle it seemed to me as if the snow would cover up all the dreariness indoors as well as out the fancy had hardly crossed my mind when i heard a step at my side i looked up thinking it was agnes well agnes said i and the words froze on my tongue for there in the door stood emma saxon i dont know how long she stood there i only know i couldnt stir or take my eyes from her afterward i was terribly frightened but at the time it wasnt fear i felt but something deeper and quieter she looked at me long and long and her face was just one dumb prayer to me but how in the world was i to help her suddenly she turned and i heard her walk down the passage this time i wasnt afraid to follow i felt that i must know what she wanted i sprang up and ran out she was at the other end of the passage and i expected her to take the turn toward my mistresss room but instead of that she pushed open the door that led to the backstairs i followed her down the stairs and across the passageway to the back door the kitchen and hall were empty at that hour the servants being off duty except for the footman who was in the pantry at the door she stood still a moment with another look at me then she turned the handle and stepped out for a minute i hesitated where was she leading me to the door had closed softly after her and i opened it and looked out halfexpecting to find that she had disappeared but i saw her a few yards off hurrying across the courtyard to the path through the woods her figure looked black and lonely in the snow and for a second my heart failed me and i thought of turning back but all the while she was drawing me after her and catching up an old shawl of mrs blinders i ran out into the open emma saxon was in the woodpath now she walked on steadily and i followed at the same pace till we passed out of the gates and reached the highroad then she struck across the open fields to the village by this time the ground was white and as she climbed the slope of a bare hill ahead of me i noticed that she left no footprints behind her at sight of that my heart shrivelled up within me and my knees were water somehow it was worse here than indoors she made the whole countryside seem lonely as the grave with none but us two in it and no help in the wide world once i tried to go back but she turned and looked at me and it was as if she had dragged me with ropes after that i followed her like a dog we came to the village and she led me through it past the church and the blacksmiths shop and down the lane to mr ranfords mr ranfords house stands close to the road a plain oldfashioned building with a flagged path leading to the door between boxborders the lane was deserted and as i turned into it i saw emma saxon pause under the old elm by the gate and now another fear came over me i saw that we had reached the end of our journey and that it was my turn to act all the way from brympton i had been asking myself what she wanted of me but i had followed in a trance as it were and not till i saw her stop at mr ranfords gate did my brain begin to clear itself it stood a little way off in the snow my heart beating fit to strangle me and my feet frozen to the ground and she stood under the elm and watched me i knew well enough that she hadnt led me there for nothing i felt there was something i ought to say or do but how was i to guess what it was i had never thought harm of my mistress and mr ranford but i was sure now that from one cause or another some dreadful thing hung over them she knew what it was she would tell me if she could perhaps she would answer if i questioned her it turned me faint to think of speaking to her but i plucked up heart and dragged myself across the few yards between us as i did so i heard the housedoor open and saw mr ranford approaching he looked handsome and cheerful as my mistress had looked that morning and at sight of him the blood began to flow again in my veins why hartley said he whats the matter i saw you coming down the lane just now and came out to see if you had taken root in the snow he stopped and stared at me what are you looking at he says i turned toward the elm as he spoke and his eyes followed me but there was no one there the lane was empty as far as the eye could reach a sense of helplessness came over me she was gone and i had not been able to guess what she wanted her last look had pierced me to the marrow and yet it had not told me all at once i felt more desolate than when she had stood there watching me it seemed as if she had left me all alone to carry the weight of the secret i couldnt guess the snow went round me in great circles and the ground fell away from me a drop of brandy and the warmth of mr ranfords fire soon brought me to and i insisted on being driven back at once to brympton it was nearly dark and i was afraid my mistress might be wanting me i explained to mr ranford that i had been out for a walk and had been taken with a fit of giddiness as i passed his gate this was true enough yet i never felt more like a liar than when i said it when i dressed mrs brympton for dinner she remarked on my pale looks and asked what ailed me i told her i had a headache and she said she would not require me again that evening and advised me to go to bed it was a fact that i could scarcely keep on my feet yet i had no fancy to spend a solitary evening in my room i sat downstairs in the hall as long as i could hold my head up but by nine i crept upstairs too weary to care what happened if i could but get my head on a pillow the rest of the household went to bed soon afterward they kept early hours when the master was away and before ten i heard mrs blinders door close and mr waces soon after it was a very still night earth and air all muffled in snow once in bed i felt easier and lay quiet listening to the strange noises that come out in a house after dark once i thought i heard a door open and close again below it might have been the glass door that led to the gardens i got up and peered out of the window but it was in the dark of the moon and nothing visible outside but the streaking of snow against the panes i went back to bed and must have dozed for i jumped awake to the furious ringing of my bell before my head was clear i had sprung out of bed and was dragging on my clothes it is going to happen now i heard myself saying but what i meant i had no notion my hands seemed to be covered with glue i thought i should never get into my clothes at last i opened my door and peered down the passage as far as my candleflame carried i could see nothing unusual ahead of me i hurried on breathless but as i pushed open the baize door leading to the main hall my heart stood still for there at the head of the stairs was emma saxon peering dreadfully down into the darkness for a second i couldnt stir but my hand slipped from the door and as it swung shut the figure vanished at the same instant there came another sound from below stairs a stealthy mysterious sound as of a latchkey turning in the housedoor i ran to mrs brymptons room and knocked there was no answer and i knocked again this time i heard some one moving in the room the bolt slipped back and my mistress stood before me to my surprise i saw that she had not undressed for the night she gave me a startled look what is this hartley she says in a whisper are you ill what are you doing here at this hour i am not ill madam but my bell rang at that she turned pale and seemed about to fall you are mistaken she said harshly i didnt ring you must have been dreaming i had never heard her speak in such a tone go back to bed she said closing the door on me but as she spoke i heard sounds again in the hall below a mans step this time and the truth leaped out on me madam i said pushing past her there is someone in the house someone mr brympton i think i hear his step below a dreadful look came over her and without a word she dropped flat at my feet i fell on my knees and tried to lift her by the way she breathed i saw it was no common faint but as i raised her head there came quick steps on the stairs and across the hall the door was flung open and there stood mr brympton in his travellingclothes the snow dripping from him he drew back with a start as he saw me kneeling by my mistress what the devil is this he shouted he was less highcolored than usual and the red spot came out on his forehead mrs brympton has fainted sir said i he laughed unsteadily and pushed by me its a pity she didnt choose a more convenient moment im sorry to disturb her but i raised myself up aghast at the mans action sir said i are you mad what are you doing going to meet a friend said he and seemed to make for the dressingroom at that my heart turned over i dont know what i thought or feared but i sprang up and caught him by the sleeve sir sir said i for pitys sake look at your wife he shook me off furiously it seems thats done for me says he and caught hold of the dressingroom door at that moment i heard a slight noise inside slight as it was he heard it too and tore the door open but as he did so he dropped back on the threshold stood emma saxon all was dark behind her but i saw her plainly and so did he he threw up his hands as if to hide his face from her and when i looked again she was gone he stood motionless as if the strength had run out of him and in the stillness my mistress suddenly raised herself and opening her eyes fixed a look on him then she fell back and i saw the deathflutter pass over her we buried her on the third day in a driving snowstorm there were few people in the church for it was bad weather to come from town and ive a notion my mistress was one that hadnt many near friends mr ranford was among the last to come just before they carried her up the aisle he was in black of course being such a friend of the family and i never saw a gentleman so pale as he passed me i noticed that he leaned a trifle on a stick he carried and i fancy mr brympton noticed it too for the red spot came out sharp on his forehead and all through the service he kept staring across the church at mr ranford instead of following the prayers as a mourner should when it was over and we went out to the graveyard mr ranford had disappeared and as soon as my poor mistresss body was underground mr brympton jumped into the carriage nearest the gate and drove off without a word to any of us i heard him call out to the station and we servants went back alone to the house the mission of jane i lethbury surveying his wife across the dinner table found his transient conjugal glance arrested by an indefinable change in her appearance how smart you look is that a new gown he asked her answering look seemed to deprecate his charging her with the extravagance of wasting a new gown on him and he now perceived that the change lay deeper than any accident of dress at the same time he noticed that she betrayed her consciousness of it by a delicate almost frightened blush it was one of the compensations of mrs lethburys protracted childishness that she still blushed as prettily as at eighteen her body had been privileged not to outstrip her mind and the two as it seemed to lethbury were destined to travel together through an eternity of girlishness i dont know what you mean she said since she never did he always wondered at her bringing this out as a fresh grievance against him but his wonder was unresentful and he said goodhumoredly you sparkle so that i thought you had on your diamonds she sighed and blushed again it must be he continued that youve been to a dressmakers opening youre absolutely brimming with illicit enjoyment she stared again this time at the adjective his adjectives always embarrassed her their unintelligibleness savored of impropriety in short he summed up youve been doing something that youre thoroughly ashamed of to his surprise she retorted i dont see why i should be ashamed of it lethbury leaned back with a smile of enjoyment when there was nothing better going he always liked to listen to her explanations well he said she was becoming breathless and ejaculatory of course youll laugh you laugh at everything that rather blunts the point of my derision doesnt it he interjected but she rushed on without noticing its so easy to laugh at things ah murmured lethbury with relish thats aunt sophronias isnt it most of his wifes opinions were heirlooms and he took a quaint pleasure in tracing their descent she was proud of their age and saw no reason for discarding them while they were still serviceable some of course were so fine that she kept them for state occasions like her greatgrandmothers crown derby but from the lady known as aunt sophronia she had inherited a stout set of everyday prejudices that were practically as good as new whereas her husbands as she noticed were always having to be replaced in the early days she had fancied there might be a certain satisfaction in taxing him with the fact but she had long since been silenced by the reply my dear im not a rich man but i never use an opinion twice if i can help it she was reduced therefore to dwelling on his moral deficiencies and one of the most obvious of these was his refusal to take things seriously on this occasion however some ulterior purpose kept her from taking up his taunt im not in the least ashamed she repeated with the air of shaking a banner to the wind but the domestic atmosphere being calm the banner drooped unheroically that said lethbury judicially encourages me to infer that you ought to be and that consequently youve been giving yourself the unusual pleasure of doing something i shouldnt approve of she met this with an almost solemn directness no she said you wont approve of it ive allowed for that ah he exclaimed setting down his liqueurglass youve worked out the whole problem eh i believe so thats uncommonly interesting and what is it she looked at him quietly a baby if it was seldom given her to surprise him she had attained the distinction for once a baby yes a human baby of course she cried with the virtuous resentment of the woman who has never allowed dogs in the house lethburys puzzled stare broke into a fresh smile a baby i shant approve of well in the abstract i dont think much of them i admit is this an abstract baby again she frowned at the adjective but she had reached a pitch of exaltation at which such obstacles could not deter her its the loveliest baby she murmured ah then its concrete it exists in this harsh world it draws its breath in pain its the healthiest child i ever saw she indignantly corrected youve seen it then again the accusing blush suffused her yes ive seen it and to whom does the paragon belong and here indeed she confounded him to me i hope she declared he pushed his chair back with an inarticulate murmur to you to us she corrected good lord he said if there had been the least hint of hallucination in her transparent gaze but no it was as clear as shallow as easily fathomable as when he had first suffered the sharp surprise of striking bottom in it it occurred to him that perhaps she was trying to be funny he knew that there is nothing more cryptic than the humor of the unhumorous is it a joke he faltered oh i hope not i want it so much to be a reality he paused to smile at the limitations of a world in which jokes were not realities and continued gently but since it is one already to us i mean to you and me i want her voice wavered and her eyes with it i have always wanted so dreadfullyit has been such a disappointmentnot to i see said lethbury slowly but he had not seen before it seemed curious now that he had never thought of her taking it in that way had never surmised any hidden depths beneath her outspread obviousness he felt as though he had touched a secret spring in her mind there was a moments silence moist and tremulous on her part awkward and slightly irritated on his youve been lonely i suppose he began it was odd having suddenly to reckon with the stranger who gazed at him out of her trivial eyes at times she said im sorry it was not your fault a man has so many occupations and women who are clever or very handsome i suppose thats an occupation too sometimes ive felt that when dinner was ordered i had nothing to do till the next day oh he groaned it wasnt your fault she insisted i never told you but when i chose that rosebud paper for the front room upstairs i always thought well it would be such a pretty paper for a baby to wake up in that was years ago of course but it was rather an expensive paper and it hasnt faded in the least she broke off incoherently it hasnt faded no and so i thoughtas we dont use the room for anything now that aunt sophronia is deadi thought i might you mightoh julian if you could only have seen it just waking up in its crib seen what where you havent got a baby upstairs oh no not yet she said with her rare laugh the girlish bubbling of merriment that had seemed one of her chief graces in the early days it occurred to him that he had not given her enough things to laugh about lately but then she needed such very elementary things it was as difficult to amuse her as a savage he concluded that he was not sufficiently simple alice he said almost solemnly what do you mean she hesitated a moment he saw her gather her courage for a supreme effort then she said slowly gravely as though she were pronouncing a sacramental phrase im so lonely without a little child and i thought perhaps youd let me adopt oneits at the hospitalits mother is deadand i couldpet it and dress it and do things for itand its such a good babyyou can ask any of the nursesit would never never bother you by crying ii lethbury accompanied his wife to the hospital in a mood of chastened wonder it did not occur to him to oppose her wish he knew of course that he would have to bear the brunt of the situation the jokes at the club the inquiries the explanations he saw himself in the comic role of the adopted father and welcomed it as an expiation for in his rapid reconstruction of the past he found himself cutting a shabbier figure than he cared to admit he had always been intolerant of stupid people and it was his punishment to be convicted of stupidity as his mind traversed the years between his marriage and this unexpected assumption of paternity he saw in the light of an overheated imagination many signs of unwonted crassness it was not that he had ceased to think his wife stupid she was stupid limited inflexible but there was a pathos in the struggles of her swaddled mind in its blind reachings toward the primal emotions he had always thought she would have been happier with a child but he had thought it mechanically because it had so often been thought before because it was in the nature of things to think it of every woman because his wife was so eminently one of a species that she fitted into all the generalizations on the sex but he had regarded this generalization as merely typical of the triumph of tradition over experience maternity was no doubt the supreme function of primitive woman the one end to which her whole organism tended but the law of increasing complexity had operated in both sexes and he had not seriously supposed that outside the world of christmas fiction and anecdotic art such truisms had any special hold on the feminine imagination now he saw that the arts in question were kept alive by the vitality of the sentiments they appealed to lethbury was in fact going through a rapid process of readjustment his marriage had been a failure but he had preserved toward his wife the exact fidelity of act that is sometimes supposed to excuse any divagation of feeling so that for years the tie between them had consisted mainly in his abstaining from making love to other women the abstention had not always been easy for the world is surprisingly wellstocked with the kind of woman one ought to have married but did not and lethbury had not escaped the solicitation of such alternatives his immunity had been purchased at the cost of taking refuge in the somewhat rarified atmosphere of his perceptions and his world being thus limited he had given unusual care to its details compensating himself for the narrowness of his horizon by the minute finish of his foreground it was a world of fine shadings and the nicest proportions where impulse seldom set a blundering foot and the feast of reason was undisturbed by an intemperate flow of soul to such a banquet his wife naturally remained uninvited the diet would have disagreed with her and she would probably have objected to the other guests but lethbury miscalculating her needs had hitherto supposed that he had made ample provision for them and was consequently at liberty to enjoy his own fare without any reproach of mendicancy at his gates now he beheld her pressing a starved face against the windows of his life and in his imaginative reaction he invested her with a pathos borrowed from the sense of his own shortcomings in the hospital the imaginative process continued with increasing force he looked at his wife with new eyes formerly she had been to him a mere bundle of negations a labyrinth of dead walls and bolted doors there was nothing behind the walls and the doors led nowhither he had sounded and listened often enough to be sure of that now he felt like a traveller who exploring some ancient ruin comes on an inner cell intact amid the general dilapidation and painted with images which reveal the forgotten uses of the building his wife stood by a white crib in one of the wards in the crib lay a child a year old the nurse affirmed but to lethburys eye a mere dateless fragment of humanity projected against a background of conjecture over this anonymous particle of life mrs lethbury leaned such ecstasy reflected in her face as strikes up in correggios nightpiece from the childs body to the mothers countenance it was a light that irradiated and dazzled her she looked up at an inquiry of lethburys but as their glances met he perceived that she no longer saw him that he had become as invisible to her as she had long been to him he had to transfer his question to the nurse what is the childs name he asked we call her jane said the nurse iii lethbury at first had resisted the idea of a legal adoption but when he found that his wifes curiously limited imagination prevented her regarding the child as hers till it had been made so by process of law he promptly withdrew his objection on one point only he remained inflexible and that was the changing of the waifs name mrs lethbury almost at once had expressed a wish to rechristen it she fluctuated between muriel and gladys deferring the moment of decision like a lady wavering between two bonnets but lethbury was unyielding in the general surrender of his prejudices this one alone held out but jane is so dreadful mrs lethbury protested well we dont know that she wont be dreadful she may grow up a jane his wife exclaimed reproachfully the nurse says shes the loveliest dont they always say that asked lethbury patiently he was prepared to be inexhaustibly patient now that he had reached a firm foothold of opposition its cruel to call her jane mrs lethbury pleaded its ridiculous to call her muriel the nurse is sure she must be a ladys child lethbury winced he had tried all along to keep his mind off the question of antecedents well let her prove it he said with a rising sense of exasperation he wondered how he could ever have allowed himself to be drawn into such a ridiculous business for the first time he felt the full irony of it he had visions of coming home in the afternoon to a house smelling of linseed and paregoric and of being greeted by a chronic howl as he went up stairs to dress for dinner he had never been a clubman but he saw himself becoming one now the worst of his anticipations were unfulfilled the baby was surprisingly well and surprisingly quiet such infantile remedies as she absorbed were not potent enough to be perceived beyond the nursery and when lethbury could be induced to enter that sanctuary there was nothing to jar his nerves in the mild pink presence of his adopted daughter jars there were indeed they were probably inevitable in the disturbed routine of the household but they occurred between mrs lethbury and the nurses and jane contributed to them only a placid stare which might have served as a rebuke to the combatants in the reaction from his first impulse of atonement lethbury noted with sharpened perceptions the effect of the change on his wifes character he saw already the error of supposing that it could work any transformation in her it simply magnified her existing qualities she was like a dried sponge put in water she expanded but she did not change her shape from the standpoint of scientific observation it was curious to see how her stored instincts responded to the pseudomaternal call she overflowed with the petty maxims of the occasion one felt in her the epitome the consummation of centuries of animal maternity so that this little woman who screamed at a mouse and was nervous about burglars came to typify the cavemother rending her prey for her young it was less easy to regard philosophically the practical effects of her borrowed motherhood lethbury found with surprise that she was becoming assertive and definite she no longer represented the negative side of his life she showed indeed a tendency to inconvenient affirmations she had gradually expanded her assumption of motherhood till it included his own share in the relation and he suddenly found himself regarded as the father of jane this was a contingency he had not foreseen and it took all his philosophy to accept it but there were moments of compensation for mrs lethbury was undoubtedly happy for the first time in years and the thought that he had tardily contributed to this end reconciled him to the irony of the means at first he was inclined to reproach himself for still viewing the situation from the outside for remaining a spectator instead of a participant he had been allured for a moment by the vision of severed hands meeting over a cradle as the whole body of domestic fiction bears witness to their doing and the fact that no such conjunction took place he could explain only on the ground that it was a borrowed cradle he did not dislike the little girl she still remained to him a hypothetical presence a query rather than a fact but her nearness was not unpleasant and there were moments when her tentative utterances her groping steps seemed to loosen the dry accretions enveloping his inner self but even at such moments moments which he invited and caressed she did not bring him nearer to his wife he now perceived that he had made a certain place in his life for mrs lethbury and that she no longer fitted into it it was too late to enlarge the space and so she overflowed and encroached lethbury struggled against the sense of submergence he let down barrier after barrier yielded privacy after privacy but his wifes personality continued to dilate she was no longer herself alone she was herself and jane gradually in a monstrous fusion of identity she became herself himself and jane and instead of trying to adapt her to a spare crevice of his character he found himself carelessly squeezed into the smallest compartment of the domestic economy iv he continued to tell himself that he was satisfied if his wife was happy and it was not till the childs tenth year that he felt a doubt of her happiness jane had been a preternaturally good child during the eight years of her adoption she had caused her fosterparents no anxiety beyond those connected with the usual succession of youthful diseases but her unknown progenitors had given her a robust constitution and she passed unperturbed through measles chickenpox and whoopingcough if there was any suffering it was endured vicariously by mrs lethbury whose temperature rose and fell with the patients and who could not hear jane sneeze without visions of a marble angel weeping over a broken column but though janes prompt recoveries continued to belie such premonitions though her existence continued to move forward on an even keel of good health and good conduct mrs lethburys satisfaction showed no corresponding advance lethbury at first was disposed to add her disappointment to the long list of feminine inconsistencies with which the sententious observer of life builds up his favorite induction but circumstances presently led him to take a kindlier view of the case hitherto his wife had regarded him as a negligible factor in janes evolution beyond providing for his adopted daughter and effacing himself before her he was not expected to contribute to her wellbeing but as time passed he appeared to his wife in a new light it was he who was to educate jane in matters of the intellect mrs lethbury was the first to declare her deficiencies to proclaim them even with a certain virtuous superiority she said she did not pretend to be clever and there was no denying the truth of the assertion now however she seemed less ready not to own her limitations but to glory in them confronted with the problem of janes instruction she stood in awe of the child i have always been stupid you know she said to lethbury with a new humility and im afraid i shant know what is best for jane im sure she has a wonderfully good mind and i should reproach myself if i didnt give her every opportunity she looked at him helplessly you must tell me what ought to be done lethbury was not unwilling to oblige her somewhere in his mental lumberroom there rusted a theory of education such as usually lingers among the impedimenta of the childless he brought this out refurbished it and applied it to jane at first he thought his wife had not overrated the quality of the childs mind jane seemed extraordinarily intelligent her precocious definiteness of mind was encouraging to her inexperienced preceptor she had no difficulty in fixing her attention and he felt that every fact he imparted was being etched in metal he helped his wife to engage the best teachers and for a while continued to take an exofficial interest in his adopted daughters studies but gradually his interest waned janes ideas did not increase with her acquisitions her young mind remained a mere receptacle for facts a kind of coldstorage from which anything that had been put there could be taken out at a moments notice intact but congealed she developed moreover an inordinate pride in the capacity of her mental storehouse and a tendency to pelt her public with its contents she was overheard to jeer at her nurse for not knowing when the saxon heptarchy had fallen and she alternately dazzled and depressed mrs lethbury by the wealth of her chronological allusions she showed no interest in the significance of the facts she amassed she simply collected dates as another child might have collected stamps or marbles to her fostermother she seemed a prodigy of wisdom but lethbury saw with a secret movement of sympathy how the aptitudes in which mrs lethbury gloried were slowly estranging her from their possessor she is getting too clever for me his wife said to him after one of janes historical flights but i am so glad that she will be a companion to you lethbury groaned in spirit he did not look forward to janes companionship she was still a good little girl but there was something automatic and formal in her goodness as though it were a kind of moral calisthenics that she went through for the sake of showing her agility an early consciousness of virtue had moreover constituted her the natural guardian and adviser of her elders before she was fifteen she had set about reforming the household she took mrs lethbury in hand first then she extended her efforts to the servants with consequences more disastrous to the domestic harmony and lastly she applied herself to lethbury she proved to him by statistics that he smoked too much and that it was injurious to the optic nerve to read in bed she took him to task for not going to church more regularly and pointed out to him the evils of desultory reading she suggested that a regular course of study encourages mental concentration and hinted that inconsecutiveness of thought is a sign of approaching age to her adopted mother her suggestions were equally pertinent she instructed mrs lethbury in an improved way of making beef stock and called her attention to the unhygienic qualities of carpets she poured out distracting facts about bacilli and vegetable mould and demonstrated that curtains and pictureframes are a hotbed of animal organisms she learned by heart the nutritive ingredients of the principal articles of diet and revolutionized the cuisine by an attempt to establish a scientific average between starch and phosphates four cooks left during this experiment and lethbury fell into the habit of dining at his club once or twice at the outset he had tried to check janes ardor but his efforts resulted only in hurting his wifes feelings jane remained impervious and mrs lethbury resented any attempt to protect her from her daughter lethbury saw that she was consoled for the sense of her own inferiority by the thought of what janes intellectual companionship must be to him and he tried to keep up the illusion by enduring with what grace he might the blighting edification of janes discourse v as jane grew up he sometimes avenged himself by wondering if his wife was still sorry that they had not called her muriel jane was not ugly she developed indeed a kind of categorical prettiness that might have been a projection of her mind she had a creditable collection of features but one had to take an inventory of them to find out that she was goodlooking the fusing grace had been omitted mrs lethbury took a touching pride in her daughters first steps in the world she expected jane to take by her complexion those whom she did not capture by her learning but janes rosy freshness did not work any perceptible ravages whether the young men guessed the axioms on her lips and detected the encyclopaedia in her eye or whether they simply found no intrinsic interest in these features certain it is that in spite of her mothers heroic efforts and of incessant calls on lethburys purse jane at the end of her first season had dropped hopelessly out of the running a few duller girls found her interesting and one or two young men came to the house with the object of meeting other young women but she was rapidly becoming one of the social supernumeraries who are asked out only because they are on peoples lists the blow was bitter to mrs lethbury but she consoled herself with the idea that jane had failed because she was too clever jane probably shared this conviction at all events she betrayed no consciousness of failure she had developed a pronounced taste for society and went out unweariedly and obstinately winter after winter while mrs lethbury toiled in her wake showering attentions on oblivious hostesses to lethbury there was something at once tragic and exasperating in the sight of their two figures the one conciliatory the other dogged both pursuing with unabated zeal the elusive prize of popularity he even began to feel a personal stake in the pursuit not as it concerned jane but as it affected his wife he saw that the latter was the victim of janes disappointment that jane was not above the crude satisfaction of taking it out of her mother experience checked the impulse to come to his wifes defence and when his resentment was at its height jane disarmed him by giving up the struggle nothing was said to mark her capitulation but lethbury noticed that the visiting ceased and that the dressmakers bills diminished at the same time mrs lethbury made it known that jane had taken up charities and before long janes conversation confirmed this announcement at first lethbury congratulated himself on the change but janes domesticity soon began to weigh on him during the day she was sometimes absent on errands of mercy but in the evening she was always there at first she and mrs lethbury sat in the drawingroom together and lethbury smoked in the library but presently jane formed the habit of joining him there and he began to suspect that he was included among the objects of her philanthropy mrs lethbury confirmed the suspicion jane has grown very seriousminded lately she said she imagines that she used to neglect you and she is trying to make up for it dont discourage her she added innocently such a plea delivered lethbury helpless to his daughters ministrations and he found himself measuring the hours he spent with her by the amount of relief they must be affording her mother there were even moments when he read a furtive gratitude in mrs lethburys eye but lethbury was no hero and he had nearly reached the limit of vicarious endurance when something wonderful happened they never quite knew afterward how it had come about or who first perceived it but mrs lethbury one day gave tremulous voice to their inferences of course she said he comes here because of elise the young lady in question a friend of janes was possessed of attractions which had already been found to explain the presence of masculine visitors lethbury risked a denial i dont think he does he declared but elise is thought very pretty mrs lethbury insisted i cant help that said lethbury doggedly he saw a faint light in his wifes eyes but she remarked carelessly mr budd would be a very good match for elise lethbury could hardly repress a chuckle he was so exquisitely aware that she was trying to propitiate the gods for a few weeks neither said a word then mrs lethbury once more reverted to the subject it is a month since elise went abroad she said is it and mr budd seems to come here just as often ah said lethbury with heroic indifference and his wife hastily changed the subject mr winstanley budd was a young man who suffered from an excess of manner politeness gushed from him in the driest seasons he was always performing feats of drawingroom chivalry and the approach of the most unobtrusive female threw him into attitudes which endangered the furniture his features being of the cherubic order did not lend themselves to this role but there were moments when he appeared to dominate them to force them into compliance with an aquiline ideal the range of mr budds social benevolence made its object hard to distinguish he spread his cloak so indiscriminately that one could not always interpret the gesture and janes impassive manner had the effect of increasing his demonstrations she threw him into paroxysms of politeness at first he filled the house with his amenities but gradually it became apparent that his most dazzling effects were directed exclusively to jane lethbury and his wife held their breath and looked away from each other they pretended not to notice the frequency of mr budds visits they struggled against an imprudent inclination to leave the young people too much alone their conclusions were the result of indirect observation for neither of them dared to be caught watching mr budd they behaved like naturalists on the trail of a rare butterfly in his efforts not to notice mr budd lethbury centred his attentions on jane and jane at this crucial moment wrung from him a reluctant admiration while her parents went about dissembling their emotions she seemed to have none to conceal she betrayed neither eagerness nor surprise so complete was her unconcern that there were moments when lethbury feared it was obtuseness when he could hardly help whispering to her that now was the moment to lower the net meanwhile the velocity of mr budds gyrations increased with the ardor of courtship his politeness became incandescent and jane found herself the centre of a pyrotechnical display culminating in the set piece of an offer of marriage mrs lethbury imparted the news to her husband one evening after their daughter had gone to bed the announcement was made and received with an air of detachment as though both feared to be betrayed into unseemly exultation but lethbury as his wife ended could not repress the inquiry have they decided on a day mrs lethburys superior command of her features enabled her to look shocked what can you be thinking of he only offered himself at five of course of course stammered lethbury but nowadays people marry after such short engagements engagement said his wife solemnly there is no engagement lethbury dropped his cigar what on earth do you mean jane is thinking it over thinking it over she has asked for a month before deciding lethbury sank back with a gasp was it genius or was it madness he felt incompetent to decide and mrs lethburys next words showed that she shared his difficulty of course i dont want to hurry jane of course not he acquiesced but i pointed out to her that a young man of mr budds impulsive temperament might might be easily discouraged yes and what did she say she said that if she was worth winning she was worth waiting for vi the period of mr budds probation could scarcely have cost him as much mental anguish as it caused his wouldbe parentsinlaw mrs lethbury by various ruses tried to shorten the ordeal but jane remained inexorable and each morning lethbury came down to breakfast with the certainty of finding a letter of withdrawal from her discouraged suitor when at length the decisive day came and mrs lethbury at its close stole into the library with an air of chastened joy they stood for a moment without speaking then mrs lethbury paid a fitting tribute to the proprieties by faltering out it will be dreadful to have to give her up lethbury could not repress a warning gesture but even as it escaped him he realized that his wifes grief was genuine of course of course he said vainly sounding his own emotional shallows for an answering regret and yet it was his wife who had suffered most from jane he had fancied that these sufferings would be effaced by the milder atmosphere of their last weeks together but felicity did not soften jane not for a moment did she relax her dominion she simply widened it to include a new subject mr budd found himself under orders with the others and a new fear assailed lethbury as he saw jane assume prenuptial control of her betrothed lethbury had never felt any strong personal interest in mr budd but as janes prospective husband the young man excited his sympathy to his surprise he found that mrs lethbury shared the feeling im afraid he may find jane a little exacting she said after an evening dedicated to a stormy discussion of the wedding arrangements she really ought to make some concessions if he wants to be married in a black frockcoat instead of a dark gray one she paused and looked doubtfully at lethbury what can i do about it he said you might explain to him tell him that jane isnt always lethbury made an impatient gesture what are you afraid of his finding her out or his not finding her out mrs lethbury flushed you put it so dreadfully her husband mused for a moment then he said with an air of cheerful hypocrisy after all budd is old enough to take care of himself but the next day mrs lethbury surprised him late in the afternoon she entered the library so breathless and inarticulate that he scented a catastrophe ive done it she cried done what told him she nodded toward the door hes just gone jane is out and i had a chance to talk to him alone lethbury pushed a chair forward and she sank into it what did you tell him that she is not always mrs lethbury lifted a tragic eye no i told him that she always is always is yes there was a pause lethbury made a call on his hoarded philosophy he saw jane suddenly reinstated in her evening seat by the library fire but an answering chord in him thrilled at his wifes heroism well what did he say mrs lethburys agitation deepened it was clear that the blow had fallen hehe saidthat wehad never understood jane or appreciated her the final syllables were lost in her handkerchief and she left him marvelling at the mechanism of a woman after that lethbury faced the future with an undaunted eye they had done their duty at least his wife had done hers and they were reaping the usual harvest of ingratitude with a zest seldom accorded to such reaping there was a marked change in mr budds manner and his increasing coldness sent a genial glow through lethburys system it was easy to bear with jane in the light of mr budds disapproval there was a good deal to be borne in the last days and the brunt of it fell on mrs lethbury jane marked her transition to the married state by an appropriate but incongruous display of nerves she became sentimental hysterical and reluctant she quarrelled with her betrothed and threatened to return the ring mrs lethbury had to intervene and lethbury felt the hovering sword of destiny but the blow was suspended mr budds chivalry was proof against all his brides caprices and his devotion throve on her cruelty lethbury feared that he was too faithful too enduring and longed to urge him to vary his tactics jane presently reappeared with the ring on her finger and consented to try on the weddingdress but her uncertainties her reactions were prolonged till the final day when it dawned lethbury was still in an ecstasy of apprehension feeling reasonably sure of the principal actors he had centred his fears on incidental possibilities the clergyman might have a stroke or the church might burn down or there might be something wrong with the license he did all that was humanly possible to avert such contingencies but there remained that incalculable factor known as the hand of god lethbury seemed to feel it groping for him in the church it almost had him by the nape mr budd was late and for five immeasurable minutes lethbury and jane faced a churchful of conjecture then the bridegroom appeared flushed but chivalrous and explaining to his fatherinlaw under cover of the ritual that he had torn his glove and had to go back for another youll be losing the ring next muttered lethbury but mr budd produced this article punctually and a moment or two later was bearing its wearer captive down the aisle at the weddingbreakfast lethbury caught his wifes eye fixed on him in mild disapproval and understood that his hilarity was exceeding the bounds of fitness he pulled himself together and tried to subdue his tone but his jubilation bubbled over like a champagneglass perpetually refilled the deeper his draughts the higher it rose it was at the brim when in the wake of the dispersing guests jane came down in her travellingdress and fell on her mothers neck i cant leave you she wailed and lethbury felt as suddenly sobered as a man under a douche but if the bride was reluctant her captor was relentless never had mr budd been more dominant more aquiline lethburys last fears were dissipated as the young man snatched jane from her mothers bosom and bore her off to the brougham the brougham rolled away the last milliners girl forsook her post by the awning the red carpet was folded up and the house door closed lethbury stood alone in the hall with his wife as he turned toward her he noticed the look of tired heroism in her eyes the deepened lines of her face they reflected his own symptoms too accurately not to appeal to him the nervous tension had been horrible he went up to her and an answering impulse made her lay a hand on his arm he held it there a moment let us go off and have a jolly little dinner at a restaurant he proposed there had been a time when such a suggestion would have surprised her to the verge of disapproval but now she agreed to it at once oh that would be so nice she murmured with a great sigh of relief and assuagement jane had fulfilled her mission after all she had drawn them together at last the reckoning i the marriage law of the new dispensation will be thou shalt not be unfaithful to thyself a discreet murmur of approval filled the studio and through the haze of cigarette smoke mrs clement westall as her husband descended from his improvised platform saw him merged in a congratulatory group of ladies westalls informal talks on the new ethics had drawn about him an eager following of the mentally unemployed those who as he had once phrased it liked to have their brainfood cut up for them the talks had begun by accident westalls ideas were known to be advanced but hitherto their advance had not been in the direction of publicity he had been in his wifes opinion almost pusillanimously careful not to let his personal views endanger his professional standing of late however he had shown a puzzling tendency to dogmatize to throw down the gauntlet to flaunt his private code in the face of society and the relation of the sexes being a topic always sure of an audience a few admiring friends had persuaded him to give his afterdinner opinions a larger circulation by summing them up in a series of talks at the van sideren studio the herbert van siderens were a couple who subsisted socially on the fact that they had a studio van siderens pictures were chiefly valuable as accessories to the mise en scene which differentiated his wifes afternoons from the blighting functions held in long new york drawingrooms and permitted her to offer their friends whiskeyandsoda instead of tea mrs van sideren for her part was skilled in making the most of the kind of atmosphere which a layfigure and an easel create and if at times she found the illusion hard to maintain and lost courage to the extent of almost wishing that herbert could paint she promptly overcame such moments of weakness by calling in some fresh talent some extraneous reenforcement of the artistic impression it was in quest of such aid that she had seized on westall coaxing him somewhat to his wifes surprise into a flattered participation in her fraud it was vaguely felt in the van sideren circle that all the audacities were artistic and that a teacher who pronounced marriage immoral was somehow as distinguished as a painter who depicted purple grass and a green sky the van sideren set were tired of the conventional colorscheme in art and conduct julia westall had long had her own views on the immorality of marriage she might indeed have claimed her husband as a disciple in the early days of their union she had secretly resented his disinclination to proclaim himself a follower of the new creed had been inclined to tax him with moral cowardice with a failure to live up to the convictions for which their marriage was supposed to stand that was in the first burst of propagandism when womanlike she wanted to turn her disobedience into a law now she felt differently she could hardly account for the change yet being a woman who never allowed her impulses to remain unaccounted for she tried to do so by saying that she did not care to have the articles of her faith misinterpreted by the vulgar in this connection she was beginning to think that almost every one was vulgar certainly there were few to whom she would have cared to intrust the defence of so esoteric a doctrine and it was precisely at this point that westall discarding his unspoken principles had chosen to descend from the heights of privacy and stand hawking his convictions at the streetcorner it was una van sideren who on this occasion unconsciously focussed upon herself mrs westalls wandering resentment in the first place the girl had no business to be there it was horrid mrs westall found herself slipping back into the old feminine vocabulary simply horrid to think of a young girls being allowed to listen to such talk the fact that una smoked cigarettes and sipped an occasional cocktail did not in the least tarnish a certain radiant innocency which made her appear the victim rather than the accomplice of her parents vulgarities julia westall felt in a hot helpless way that something ought to be done that some one ought to speak to the girls mother and just then una glided up oh mrs westall how beautiful it was una fixed her with large limpid eyes you believe it all i suppose she asked with seraphic gravity all what my dear child the girl shone on her about the higher life the freer expansion of the individual the law of fidelity to ones self she glibly recited mrs westall to her own wonder blushed a deep and burning blush my dear una she said you dont in the least understand what its all about miss van sideren stared with a slowly answering blush dont you then she murmured mrs westall laughed not always or altogether but i should like some tea please una led her to the corner where innocent beverages were dispensed as julia received her cup she scrutinized the girl more carefully it was not such a girlish face after all definite lines were forming under the rosy haze of youth she reflected that una must be sixandtwenty and wondered why she had not married a nice stock of ideas she would have as her dower if they were to be a part of the modern girls trousseau mrs westall caught herself up with a start it was as though some one else had been speaking a stranger who had borrowed her own voice she felt herself the dupe of some fantastic mental ventriloquism concluding suddenly that the room was stifling and unas tea too sweet she set down her cup and looked about for westall to meet his eyes had long been her refuge from every uncertainty she met them now but only as she felt in transit they included her parenthetically in a larger flight she followed the flight and it carried her to a corner to which una had withdrawn one of the palmy nooks to which mrs van sideren attributed the success of her saturdays westall a moment later had overtaken his look and found a place at the girls side she bent forward speaking eagerly he leaned back listening with the depreciatory smile which acted as a filter to flattery enabling him to swallow the strongest doses without apparent grossness of appetite julia winced at her own definition of the smile on the way home in the deserted winter dusk westall surprised his wife by a sudden boyish pressure of her arm did i open their eyes a bit did i tell them what you wanted me to he asked gaily almost unconsciously she let her arm slip from his what i wanted why havent you all this time she caught the honest wonder of his tone i somehow fancied youd rather blamed me for not talking more openly before youve made me feel at times that i was sacrificing principles to expediency she paused a moment over her reply then she asked quietly what made you decide not to any longer she felt again the vibration of a faint surprise why the wish to please you he answered almost too simply i wish you would not go on then she said abruptly he stopped in his quick walk and she felt his stare through the darkness not go on call a hansom please im tired broke from her with a sudden rush of physical weariness instantly his solicitude enveloped her the room had been infernally hot and then that confounded cigarette smoke he had noticed once or twice that she looked pale she mustnt come to another saturday she felt herself yielding as she always did to the warm influence of his concern for her the feminine in her leaning on the man in him with a conscious intensity of abandonment he put her in the hansom and her hand stole into his in the darkness a tear or two rose and she let them fall it was so delicious to cry over imaginary troubles that evening after dinner he surprised her by reverting to the subject of his talk he combined a mans dislike of uncomfortable questions with an almost feminine skill in eluding them and she knew that if he returned to the subject he must have some special reason for doing so you seem not to have cared for what i said this afternoon did i put the case badly no you put it very well then what did you mean by saying that you would rather not have me go on with it she glanced at him nervously her ignorance of his intention deepening her sense of helplessness i dont think i care to hear such things discussed in public i dont understand you he exclaimed again the feeling that his surprise was genuine gave an air of obliquity to her own attitude she was not sure that she understood herself wont you explain he said with a tinge of impatience her eyes wandered about the familiar drawingroom which had been the scene of so many of their evening confidences the shaded lamps the quietcolored walls hung with mezzotints the pale spring flowers scattered here and there in venice glasses and bowls of old sevres recalled she hardly knew why the apartment in which the evenings of her first marriage had been passed a wilderness of rosewood and upholstery with a picture of a roman peasant above the mantelpiece and a greek slave in statuary marble between the foldingdoors of the back drawingroom it was a room with which she had never been able to establish any closer relation than that between a traveller and a railway station and now as she looked about at the surroundings which stood for her deepest affinities the room for which she had left that other room she was startled by the same sense of strangeness and unfamiliarity the prints the flowers the subdued tones of the old porcelains seemed to typify a superficial refinement that had no relation to the deeper significances of life suddenly she heard her husband repeating his question i dont know that i can explain she faltered he drew his armchair forward so that he faced her across the hearth the light of a readinglamp fell on his finely drawn face which had a kind of surfacesensitiveness akin to the surfacerefinement of its setting is it that you no longer believe in our ideas he asked in our ideas the ideas i am trying to teach the ideas you and i are supposed to stand for he paused a moment the ideas on which our marriage was founded the blood rushed to her face he had his reasons then she was sure now that he had his reasons in the ten years of their marriage how often had either of them stopped to consider the ideas on which it was founded how often does a man dig about the basement of his house to examine its foundation the foundation is there of course the house rests on it but one lives abovestairs and not in the cellar it was she indeed who in the beginning had insisted on reviewing the situation now and then on recapitulating the reasons which justified her course on proclaiming from time to time her adherence to the religion of personal independence but she had long ceased to feel the need of any such ideal standards and had accepted her marriage as frankly and naturally as though it had been based on the primitive needs of the heart and needed no special sanction to explain or justify it of course i still believe in our ideas she exclaimed then i repeat that i dont understand it was a part of your theory that the greatest possible publicity should be given to our view of marriage have you changed your mind in that respect she hesitated it depends on circumstances on the public one is addressing the set of people that the van siderens get about them dont care for the truth or falseness of a doctrine they are attracted simply by its novelty and yet it was in just such a set of people that you and i met and learned the truth from each other that was different i thought you considered it one of the deepest social wrongs that such things never are discussed before young girls but that is beside the point for i dont remember seeing any young girl in my audience today except una van sideren he turned slightly and pushed back the lamp at his elbow oh miss van sideren naturally why naturally the daughter of the house would you have had her sent out with her governess if i had a daughter i should not allow such things to go on in my house westall stroking his mustache leaned back with a faint smile i fancy miss van sideren is quite capable of taking care of herself no girl knows how to take care of herself till its too late and yet you would deliberately deny her the surest means of selfdefence what do you call the surest means of selfdefence some preliminary knowledge of human nature in its relation to the marriage tie she made an impatient gesture how should you like to marry that kind of a girl immensely if she were my kind of girl in other respects she took up the argument at another point you are quite mistaken if you think such talk does not affect young girls una was in a state of the most absurd exaltation she broke off wondering why she had spoken westall reopened a magazine which he had laid aside at the beginning of their discussion what you tell me is immensely flattering to my oratorical talent but i fear you overrate its effect i can assure you that miss van sideren doesnt have to have her thinking done for her shes quite capable of doing it herself you seem very familiar with her mental processes flashed unguardedly from his wife he looked up quietly from the pages he was cutting i should like to be he answered she interests me ii if there be a distinction in being misunderstood it was one denied to julia westall when she left her first husband every one was ready to excuse and even to defend her the world she adorned agreed that john arment was impossible and hostesses gave a sigh of relief at the thought that it would no longer be necessary to ask him to dine there had been no scandal connected with the divorce neither side had accused the other of the offence euphemistically described as statutory the arments had indeed been obliged to transfer their allegiance to a state which recognized desertion as a cause for divorce and construed the term so liberally that the seeds of desertion were shown to exist in every union even mrs arments second marriage did not make traditional morality stir in its sleep it was known that she had not met her second husband till after she had parted from the first and she had moreover replaced a rich man by a poor one though clement westall was acknowledged to be a rising lawyer it was generally felt that his fortunes would not rise as rapidly as his reputation the westalls would probably always have to live quietly and go out to dinner in cabs could there be better evidence of mrs arments complete disinterestedness if the reasoning by which her friends justified her course was somewhat cruder and less complex than her own elucidation of the matter both explanations led to the same conclusion john arment was impossible the only difference was that to his wife his impossibility was something deeper than a social disqualification she had once said in ironical defence of her marriage that it had at least preserved her from the necessity of sitting next to him at dinner but she had not then realized at what cost the immunity was purchased john arment was impossible but the sting of his impossibility lay in the fact that he made it impossible for those about him to be other than himself by an unconscious process of elimination he had excluded from the world everything of which he did not feel a personal need had become as it were a climate in which only his own requirements survived this might seem to imply a deliberate selfishness but there was nothing deliberate about arment he was as instinctive as an animal or a child it was this childish element in his nature which sometimes for a moment unsettled his wifes estimate of him was it possible that he was simply undeveloped that he had delayed somewhat longer than is usual the laborious process of growing up he had the kind of sporadic shrewdness which causes it to be said of a dull man that he is no fool and it was this quality that his wife found most trying even to the naturalist it is annoying to have his deductions disturbed by some unforeseen aberrancy of form or function and how much more so to the wife whose estimate of herself is inevitably bound up with her judgment of her husband arments shrewdness did not indeed imply any latent intellectual power it suggested rather potentialities of feeling of suffering perhaps in a blind rudimentary way on which julias sensibilities naturally declined to linger she so fully understood her own reasons for leaving him that she disliked to think they were not as comprehensible to her husband she was haunted in her analytic moments by the look of perplexity too inarticulate for words with which he had acquiesced to her explanations these moments were rare with her however her marriage had been too concrete a misery to be surveyed philosophically if she had been unhappy for complex reasons the unhappiness was as real as though it had been uncomplicated soul is more bruisable than flesh and julia was wounded in every fibre of her spirit her husbands personality seemed to be closing gradually in on her obscuring the sky and cutting off the air till she felt herself shut up among the decaying bodies of her starved hopes a sense of having been decoyed by some worldold conspiracy into this bondage of body and soul filled her with despair if marriage was the slow lifelong acquittal of a debt contracted in ignorance then marriage was a crime against human nature she for one would have no share in maintaining the pretence of which she had been a victim the pretence that a man and a woman forced into the narrowest of personal relations must remain there till the end though they may have outgrown the span of each others natures as the mature tree outgrows the iron brace about the sapling it was in the first heat of her moral indignation that she had met clement westall she had seen at once that he was interested and had fought off the discovery dreading any influence that should draw her back into the bondage of conventional relations to ward off the peril she had with an almost crude precipitancy revealed her opinions to him to her surprise she found that he shared them she was attracted by the frankness of a suitor who while pressing his suit admitted that he did not believe in marriage her worst audacities did not seem to surprise him he had thought out all that she had felt and they had reached the same conclusion people grew at varying rates and the yoke that was an easy fit for the one might soon become galling to the other that was what divorce was for the readjustment of personal relations as soon as their necessarily transitive nature was recognized they would gain in dignity as well as in harmony there would be no farther need of the ignoble concessions and connivances the perpetual sacrifice of personal delicacy and moral pride by means of which imperfect marriages were now held together each partner to the contract would be on his mettle forced to live up to the highest standard of selfdevelopment on pain of losing the others respect and affection the low nature could no longer drag the higher down but must struggle to rise or remain alone on its inferior level the only necessary condition to a harmonious marriage was a frank recognition of this truth and a solemn agreement between the contracting parties to keep faith with themselves and not to live together for a moment after complete accord had ceased to exist between them the new adultery was unfaithfulness to self it was as westall had just reminded her on this understanding that they had married the ceremony was an unimportant concession to social prejudice now that the door of divorce stood open no marriage need be an imprisonment and the contract therefore no longer involved any diminution of selfrespect the nature of their attachment placed them so far beyond the reach of such contingencies that it was easy to discuss them with an open mind and julias sense of security made her dwell with a tender insistence on westalls promise to claim his release when he should cease to love her the exchange of these vows seemed to make them in a sense champions of the new law pioneers in the forbidden realm of individual freedom they felt that they had somehow achieved beatitude without martyrdom this as julia now reviewed the past she perceived to have been her theoretical attitude toward marriage it was unconsciously insidiously that her ten years of happiness with westall had developed another conception of the tie a reversion rather to the old instinct of passionate dependency and possessorship that now made her blood revolt at the mere hint of change change renewal was that what they had called it in their foolish jargon destruction extermination rather this rending of a myriad fibres interwoven with anothers being another but he was not other he and she were one one in the mystic sense which alone gave marriage its significance the new law was not for them but for the disunited creatures forced into a mockery of union the gospel she had felt called on to proclaim had no bearing on her own case she sent for the doctor and told him she was sure she needed a nerve tonic she took the nerve tonic diligently but it failed to act as a sedative to her fears she did not know what she feared but that made her anxiety the more pervasive her husband had not reverted to the subject of his saturday talks he was unusually kind and considerate with a softening of his quick manner a touch of shyness in his consideration that sickened her with new fears she told herself that it was because she looked badly because he knew about the doctor and the nerve tonic that he showed this deference to her wishes this eagerness to screen her from moral draughts but the explanation simply cleared the way for fresh inferences the week passed slowly vacantly like a prolonged sunday on saturday the morning post brought a note from mrs van sideren would dear julia ask mr westall to come half an hour earlier than usual as there was to be some music after his talk westall was just leaving for his office when his wife read the note she opened the drawingroom door and called him back to deliver the message he glanced at the note and tossed it aside what a bore i shall have to cut my game of racquets well i suppose it cant be helped will you write and say its all right julia hesitated a moment her hand stiffening on the chairback against which she leaned you mean to go on with these talks she asked i why not he returned and this time it struck her that his surprise was not quite unfeigned the discovery helped her to find words you said you had started them with the idea of pleasing me well i told you last week that they didnt please me last week oh he seemed to make an effort of memory i thought you were nervous then you sent for the doctor the next day it was not the doctor i needed it was your assurance my assurance suddenly she felt the floor fail under her she sank into the chair with a choking throat her words her reasons slipping away from her like straws down a whirling flood clement she cried isnt it enough for you to know that i hate it he turned to close the door behind them then he walked toward her and sat down what is it that you hate he asked gently she had made a desperate effort to rally her routed argument i cant bear to have you speak as if as if our marriage were like the other kind the wrong kind when i heard you there the other afternoon before all those inquisitive gossiping people proclaiming that husbands and wives had a right to leave each other whenever they were tired or had seen some one else westall sat motionless his eyes fixed on a pattern of the carpet you have ceased to take this view then he said as she broke off you no longer believe that husbands and wives are justified in separating under such conditions under such conditions she stammered yes i still believe that but how can we judge for others what can we know of the circumstances he interrupted her i thought it was a fundamental article of our creed that the special circumstances produced by marriage were not to interfere with the full assertion of individual liberty he paused a moment i thought that was your reason for leaving arment she flushed to the forehead it was not like him to give a personal turn to the argument it was my reason she said simply well then why do you refuse to recognize its validity now i dont i dont i only say that one cant judge for others he made an impatient movement this is mere hairsplitting what you mean is that the doctrine having served your purpose when you needed it you now repudiate it well she exclaimed flushing again what if i do what does it matter to us westall rose from his chair he was excessively pale and stood before his wife with something of the formality of a stranger it matters to me he said in a low voice because i do not repudiate it well and because i had intended to invoke it as he paused and drew his breath deeply she sat silent almost deafened by her heartbeats as a complete justification of the course i am about to take julia remained motionless what course is that she asked he cleared his throat i mean to claim the fulfilment of your promise for an instant the room wavered and darkened then she recovered a torturing acuteness of vision every detail of her surroundings pressed upon her the tick of the clock the slant of sunlight on the wall the hardness of the chairarms that she grasped were a separate wound to each sense my promise she faltered your part of our mutual agreement to set each other free if one or the other should wish to be released she was silent again he waited a moment shifting his position nervously then he said with a touch of irritability you acknowledge the agreement the question went through her like a shock she lifted her head to it proudly i acknowledge the agreement she said and you dont mean to repudiate it a log on the hearth fell forward and mechanically he advanced and pushed it back no she answered slowly i dont mean to repudiate it there was a pause he remained near the hearth his elbow resting on the mantelshelf close to his hand stood a little cup of jade that he had given her on one of their wedding anniversaries she wondered vaguely if he noticed it you intend to leave me then she said at length his gesture seemed to deprecate the crudeness of the allusion to marry some one else again his eye and hand protested she rose and stood before him why should you be afraid to tell me is it una van sideren he was silent i wish you good luck she said iii she looked up finding herself alone she did not remember when or how he had left the room or how long afterward she had sat there the fire still smouldered on the hearth but the slant of sunlight had left the wall her first conscious thought was that she had not broken her word that she had fulfilled the very letter of their bargain there had been no crying out no vain appeal to the past no attempt at temporizing or evasion she had marched straight up to the guns now that it was over she sickened to find herself alive she looked about her trying to recover her hold on reality her identity seemed to be slipping from her as it disappears in a physical swoon this is my room this is my house she heard herself saying her room her house she could almost hear the walls laugh back at her she stood up a dull ache in every bone the silence of the room frightened her she remembered now having heard the front door close a long time ago the sound suddenly reechoed through her brain her husband must have left the house then her husband she no longer knew in what terms to think the simplest phrases had a poisoned edge she sank back into her chair overcome by a strange weakness the clock struck ten it was only ten oclock suddenly she remembered that she had not ordered dinneror were they dining out that evening dinner dining out the old meaningless phraseology pursued her she must try to think of herself as she would think of some one else a some one dissociated from all the familiar routine of the past whose wants and habits must gradually be learned as one might spy out the ways of a strange animal the clock struck another hour eleven she stood up again and walked to the door she thought she would go up stairs to her room her room again the word derided her she opened the door crossed the narrow hall and walked up the stairs as she passed she noticed westalls sticks and umbrellas a pair of his gloves lay on the hall table the same staircarpet mounted between the same walls the same old french print in its narrow black frame faced her on the landing this visual continuity was intolerable within a gaping chasm without the same untroubled and familiar surface she must get away from it before she could attempt to think but once in her room she sat down on the lounge a stupor creeping over her gradually her vision cleared a great deal had happened in the interval a wild marching and countermarching of emotions arguments ideas a fury of insurgent impulses that fell back spent upon themselves she had tried at first to rally to organize these chaotic forces there must be help somewhere if only she could master the inner tumult life could not be broken off short like this for a whim a fancy the law itself would side with her would defend her the law what claim had she upon it she was the prisoner of her own choice she had been her own legislator and she was the predestined victim of the code she had devised but this was grotesque intolerable a mad mistake for which she could not be held accountable the law she had despised was still there might still be invokedinvoked but to what end could she ask it to chain westall to her side she had been allowed to go free when she claimed her freedom should she show less magnanimity than she had exacted magnanimity the word lashed her with its irony one does not strike an attitude when one is fighting for life she would threaten grovel cajoleshe would yield anything to keep her hold on happiness ah but the difficulty lay deeper the law could not help her her own apostasy could not help her she was the victim of the theories she renounced it was as though some giant machine of her own making had caught her up in its wheels and was grinding her to atoms it was afternoon when she found herself outofdoors she walked with an aimless haste fearing to meet familiar faces the day was radiant metallic one of those searching american days so calculated to reveal the shortcomings of our streetcleaning and the excesses of our architecture the streets looked bare and hideous everything stared and glittered she called a passing hansom and gave mrs van siderens address she did not know what had led up to the act but she found herself suddenly resolved to speak to cry out a warning it was too late to save herself but the girl might still be told the hansom rattled up fifth avenue she sat with her eyes fixed avoiding recognition at the van siderens door she sprang out and rang the bell action had cleared her brain and she felt calm and selfpossessed she knew now exactly what she meant to say the ladies were both outthe parlormaid stood waiting for a card julia with a vague murmur turned away from the door and lingered a moment on the sidewalk then she remembered that she had not paid the cabdriver she drew a dollar from her purse and handed it to him he touched his hat and drove off leaving her alone in the long empty street she wandered away westward toward strange thoroughfares where she was not likely to meet acquaintances the feeling of aimlessness had returned once she found herself in the afternoon torrent of broadway swept past tawdry shops and flaming theatrical posters with a succession of meaningless faces gliding by in the opposite direction a feeling of faintness reminded her that she had not eaten since morning she turned into a side street of shabby houses with rows of ashbarrels behind bent area railings in a basement window she saw the sign ladies restaurant a pie and a dish of doughnuts lay against the dusty pane like petrified food in an ethnological museum she entered and a young woman with a weak mouth and a brazen eye cleared a table for her near the window the table was covered with a red and white cotton cloth and adorned with a bunch of celery in a thick tumbler and a saltcellar full of grayish lumpy salt julia ordered tea and sat a long time waiting for it she was glad to be away from the noise and confusion of the streets the lowceilinged room was empty and two or three waitresses with thin pert faces lounged in the background staring at her and whispering together at last the tea was brought in a discolored metal teapot julia poured a cup and drank it hastily it was black and bitter but it flowed through her veins like an elixir she was almost dizzy with exhilaration oh how tired how unutterably tired she had been she drank a second cup blacker and bitterer and now her mind was once more working clearly she felt as vigorous as decisive as when she had stood on the van siderens doorstep but the wish to return there had subsided she saw now the futility of such an attempt the humiliation to which it might have exposed her the pity of it was that she did not know what to do next the short winter day was fading and she realized that she could not remain much longer in the restaurant without attracting notice she paid for her tea and went out into the street the lamps were alight and here and there a basement shop cast an oblong of gaslight across the fissured pavement in the dusk there was something sinister about the aspect of the street and she hastened back toward fifth avenue she was not used to being out alone at that hour at the corner of fifth avenue she paused and stood watching the stream of carriages at last a policeman caught sight of her and signed to her that he would take her across she had not meant to cross the street but she obeyed automatically and presently found herself on the farther corner there she paused again for a moment but she fancied the policeman was watching her and this sent her hastening down the nearest side street after that she walked a long time vaguely night had fallen and now and then through the windows of a passing carriage she caught the expanse of an evening waistcoat or the shimmer of an opera cloak suddenly she found herself in a familiar street she stood still a moment breathing quickly she had turned the corner without noticing whither it led but now a few yards ahead of her she saw the house in which she had once lived her first husbands house the blinds were drawn and only a faint translucence marked the windows and the transom above the door as she stood there she heard a step behind her and a man walked by in the direction of the house he walked slowly with a heavy middleaged gait his head sunk a little between the shoulders the red crease of his neck visible above the fur collar of his overcoat he crossed the street went up the steps of the house drew forth a latchkey and let himself in there was no one else in sight julia leaned for a long time against the arearail at the corner her eyes fixed on the front of the house the feeling of physical weariness had returned but the strong tea still throbbed in her veins and lit her brain with an unnatural clearness presently she heard another step draw near and moving quickly away she too crossed the street and mounted the steps of the house the impulse which had carried her there prolonged itself in a quick pressure of the electric bell then she felt suddenly weak and tremulous and grasped the balustrade for support the door opened and a young footman with a fresh inexperienced face stood on the threshold julia knew in an instant that he would admit her i saw mr arment going in just now she said will you ask him to see me for a moment the footman hesitated i think mr arment has gone up to dress for dinner madam julia advanced into the hall i am sure he will see me i will not detain him long she said she spoke quietly authoritatively in the tone which a good servant does not mistake the footman had his hand on the drawingroom door i will tell him madam what name please julia trembled she had not thought of that merely say a lady she returned carelessly the footman wavered and she fancied herself lost but at that instant the door opened from within and john arment stepped into the hall he drew back sharply as he saw her his florid face turning sallow with the shock then the blood poured back to it swelling the veins on his temples and reddening the lobes of his thick ears it was long since julia had seen him and she was startled at the change in his appearance he had thickened coarsened settled down into the enclosing flesh but she noted this insensibly her one conscious thought was that now she was face to face with him she must not let him escape till he had heard her every pulse in her body throbbed with the urgency of her message she went up to him as he drew back i must speak to you she said arment hesitated red and stammering julia glanced at the footman and her look acted as a warning the instinctive shrinking from a scene predominated over every other impulse and arment said slowly will you come this way he followed her into the drawingroom and closed the door julia as she advanced was vaguely aware that the room at least was unchanged time had not mitigated its horrors the contadina still lurched from the chimneybreast and the greek slave obstructed the threshold of the inner room the place was alive with memories they started out from every fold of the yellow satin curtains and glided between the angles of the rosewood furniture but while some subordinate agency was carrying these impressions to her brain her whole conscious effort was centred in the act of dominating arments will the fear that he would refuse to hear her mounted like fever to her brain she felt her purpose melt before it words and arguments running into each other in the heat of her longing for a moment her voice failed her and she imagined herself thrust out before she could speak but as she was struggling for a word arment pushed a chair forward and said quietly you are not well the sound of his voice steadied her it was neither kind nor unkind a voice that suspended judgment rather awaiting unforeseen developments she supported herself against the back of the chair and drew a deep breath shall i send for something he continued with a cold embarrassed politeness julia raised an entreating hand no no thank you i am quite well he paused midway toward the bell and turned on her then may i ask yes she interrupted him i came here because i wanted to see you there is something i must tell you arment continued to scrutinize her i am surprised at that he said i should have supposed that any communication you may wish to make could have been made through our lawyers our lawyers she burst into a little laugh i dont think they could help me this time arments face took on a barricaded look if there is any question of help of course it struck her whimsically that she had seen that look when some shabby devil called with a subscriptionbook perhaps he thought she wanted him to put his name down for so much in sympathy or even in money the thought made her laugh again she saw his look change slowly to perplexity all his facial changes were slow and she remembered suddenly how it had once diverted her to shift that lumbering scenery with a word for the first time it struck her that she had been cruel there is a question of help she said in a softer key you can help me but only by listening i want to tell you something arments resistance was not yielding would it not be easier to write he suggested she shook her head there is no time to writeand it wont take long she raised her head and their eyes met my husband has left me she said westall he stammered reddening again yes this morning just as i left you because he was tired of me the words uttered scarcely above a whisper seemed to dilate to the limit of the room arment looked toward the door then his embarrassed glance returned to julia i am very sorry he said awkwardly thank you she murmured but i dont see no but you will in a moment wont you listen to me please instinctively she had shifted her position putting herself between him and the door it happened this morning she went on in short breathless phrases i never suspected anything i thought we were perfectly happy suddenly he told me he was tired of me there is a girl he likes better he has gone to her as she spoke the lurking anguish rose upon her possessing her once more to the exclusion of every other emotion her eyes ached her throat swelled with it and two painful tears burnt a way down her face arments constraint was increasing visibly this this is very unfortunate he began but i should say the law the law she echoed ironically when he asks for his freedom you are not obliged to give it you were not obliged to give me mine but you did he made a protesting gesture you saw that the law couldnt help you didnt you she went on that is what i see now the law represents material rights it cant go beyond if we dont recognize an inner lawthe obligation that love createsbeing loved as well as loving there is nothing to prevent our spreading ruin unhinderedis there she raised her head plaintively with the look of a bewildered child that is what i see nowwhat i wanted to tell you he leaves me because hes tiredbut i was not tired and i dont understand why he is thats the dreadful part of it the not understanding i hadnt realized what it meant but ive been thinking of it all day and things have come back to me things i hadnt noticedwhen you and i she moved closer to him and fixed her eyes on his with the gaze that tries to reach beyond words i see now that you didnt understand did you their eyes met in a sudden shock of comprehension a veil seemed to be lifted between them arments lip trembled no he said i didnt understand she gave a little cry almost of triumph i knew it i knew it you wondered you tried to tell me but no words came you saw your life falling in ruinsthe world slipping from youand you couldnt speak or move she sank down on the chair against which she had been leaning now i know now i know she repeated i am very sorry for you she heard arment stammer she looked up quickly thats not what i came for i dont want you to be sorry i came to ask you to forgive mefor not understanding that you didnt understand thats all i wanted to say she rose with a vague sense that the end had come and put out a groping hand toward the door arment stood motionless she turned to him with a faint smile you forgive me there is nothing to forgive then will you shake hands for goodby she felt his hand in hers it was nerveless reluctant goodby she repeated i understand now she opened the door and passed out into the hall as she did so arment took an impulsive step forward but just then the footman who was evidently alive to his obligations advanced from the background to let her out she heard arment fall back the footman threw open the door and she found herself outside in the darkness the letter i for many years he had lived withdrawn from the world in which he had once played so active and even turbulent a part the study of tuscan art was his only pursuit and it was to help him in the classification of his notes and documents that i was first called to his villa colonel alingdon had then the look of a very old man though his age can hardly have exceeded seventy he was small and bent with a finely wrinkled face which still wore the tan of youthful exposure but for this dusky redness it would have been hard to reconstruct from the shrunken recluse with his low fastidious voice and carefully tended hands an image of that young knight of adventure whose sword had been at the service of every uprising which stirred the uneasy soil of italy in the first half of the nineteenth century though i was more of a proficient in colonel alingdons later than his earlier pursuits the thought of his soldiering days was always coming between me and the pacific work of his old age as we sat collating papers and comparing photographs i had the feeling that this dry and quiet old man had seen even stranger things than people said that he knew more of the inner history of europe than half the diplomatists of his day i was not alone in this conviction and the friend who had engaged me for colonel alingdon had appended to his instructions the injunction to get him to talk but this was what no one could do colonel alingdon was ready to discuss by the hour the date of a giottesque triptych or the attribution of a disputed master but on the history of his early life he was habitually silent it was perhaps because i recognized this silence and respected it that it afterward came to be broken for me or it was perhaps merely because as the failure of colonel alingdons sight cut him off from his work he felt the natural inclination of age to revert from the empty present to the crowded past for one cause or another he did talk to me in the last year of his life and i felt myself mingled to an extent inconceivable to the mere reader of history with the passionate scenes of the italian struggle for liberty colonel alingdon had been mixed with it in all its phases he had known the last carbonari and the young italy of mazzini he had been in perugia when the mercenaries of a liberal pope slaughtered women and children in the streets he had been in sicily with the thousand and in milan during the cinque giornate they say the italians didnt know how to fight he said one day musingly that the french had to come down and do their work for them people forget how long it was since they had had any fighting to do but they hadnt forgotten how to suffer and hold their tongues how to die and take their secrets with them the italian war of independence was really carried on underground it was one of those awful silent struggles which are so much more terrible than the roar of a battle its a deuced sight easier to charge with your regiment than to lie rotting in an austrian prison and know that if you give up the name of a friend or two you can go back scotfree to your wife and children and thousands and thousands of italians had the choice given them and hardly one went back he sat silent his meditative fingertips laid together his eyes fixed on the past which was the now only thing clearly visible to them and the women i said were they as brave as the men i had not spoken quite at random i had always heard that there had been as much of love as of war in colonel alingdons early career and i hoped that my question might give a personal turn to his reminiscences the women he repeated they were braver for they had more to bear and less to do italy could never have been saved without them his eye had kindled and i detected in it the reflection of some vivid memory it was then that i asked him what was the bravest thing he had ever known of a womans doing the question was such a vague one that i hardly knew why i had put it but to my surprise he answered almost at once as though i had touched on a subject of frequent meditation the bravest thing i ever saw done by a woman he said was brought about by an act of my own and one of which i am not particularly proud for that reason i have never spoken of it before there was a time when i didnt even care to think of it but all that is past now she died years ago and so did the jack alingdon she knew and in telling you the story i am no more than the mouthpiece of an old tradition which some ancestor might have handed down to me he leaned back his clear blind gaze fixed smilingly on me and i had the feeling that in groping through the labyrinth of his young adventures i had come unawares upon their central point ii when i was in milan in fortyseven an unlucky thing happened to me i had been sent there to look over the ground by some of my italian friends in england as an english officer i had no difficulty in getting into milanese society for england had for years been the refuge of the italian fugitives and i was known to be working in their interests it was just the kind of job i liked and i never enjoyed life more than i did in those days there was a great deal going on good music balls and theatres milan kept up her gayety to the last the english were shocked by the insouciance of a race who could dance under the very nose of the usurper but those who understood the situation knew that milan was playing brutus and playing it uncommonly well i was in the thick of it all it was just the atmosphere to suit a young fellow of nineandtwenty with a healthy passion for waltzing and fighting but as i said an unlucky thing happened to me i was fool enough to fall in love with donna candida falco you have heard of her of course you know the share she had in the great work in a different way she was what the terrible princess belgioioso had been to an earlier generation but donna candida was not terrible she was quiet discreet and charming when i knew her she was a widow of thirty her husband andrea falco having died ten years previously soon after their marriage the marriage had been notoriously unhappy and his death was a release to donna candida her family were of modena but they had come to live in milan soon after the execution of ciro menotti and his companions you remember the details of that business the duke of modena one of the most adroit villains in europe had been bitten with the hope of uniting the italian states under his rule it was a vision of italian liberation of a sort a few madmen were dazzled by it and ciro menotti was one of them you know the end the duke of modena who had counted on louis philippes backing found that that astute sovereign had betrayed him to austria instantly he saw that his first business was to get rid of the conspirators he had created there was nothing easier than for a hapsburg este to turn on a friend ciro menotti had staked his life for the duke and the duke took it you may remember that on the night when seven hundred men and a cannon attacked menottis house the duke was seen looking on at the slaughter from an arcade across the square well among the lesser fry taken that night was a lad of eighteen emilio verna who was the only brother of donna candida the verna family was one of the most respected in modena it consisted at that time of the mother countess verna of young emilio and his sister count verna had been in spielberg in the twenties he had never recovered from his sufferings there and died in exile without seeing his wife and children again countess verna had been an ardent patriot in her youth but the failure of the first attempts against austria had discouraged her she thought that in losing her husband she had sacrificed enough for her country and her one idea was to keep emilio on good terms with the government but the verna blood was not tractable and his fathers death was not likely to make emilio a good subject of the estes not that he had as yet taken any active share in the work of the conspirators he simply hadnt had time at his trial there was nothing to show that he had been in menottis confidence but he had been seen once or twice coming out of what the ducal police called suspicious houses and in his desk were found some verses to italy that was enough to hang a man in modena and emilio verna was hanged the countess never recovered from the blow the circumstances of her sons death were too abominable to unendurable if he had risked his life in the conspiracy she might have been reconciled to his losing it but he was a mere child who had sat at home chafing but powerless while his seniors plotted and fought he had been sacrificed to the dukes insane fear to his savage greed for victims and the countess verna was not to be consoled as soon as possible the mother and daughter left modena for milan there they lived in seclusion till candidas marriage during her girlhood she had had to accept her mothers view of life to shut herself up in the tomb in which the poor woman brooded over her martyrs but that was not the girls way of honoring the dead at the moment when the first shot was fired on menottis house she had been reading petrarchs ode to the lords of italy and the lines lantico valor ne vitalici cor non e ancor morto had lodged like a bullet in her brain from the day of her marriage she began to take a share in the silent work which was going on throughout italy milan was at that time the centre of the movement and candida falco threw herself into it with all the passion which her unhappy marriage left unsatisfied at first she had to act with great reserve for her husband was a prudent man who did not care to have his habits disturbed by political complications but after his death there was nothing to restrain her except the exquisite tact which enabled her to work night and day in the italian cause without giving the austrian authorities a pretext for interference when i first knew donna candida her mother was still living a tragic woman prematurely bowed like an image of death in the background of the daughters brilliant life the countess since her sons death had become a patriot again though in a narrower sense than candida the mothers first thought was that her dead must be avenged the daughters that italy must be saved but from different motives they worked for the same end candida felt for the countess that protecting tenderness with which italian children so often regard their parents a feeling heightened by the reverence which the mothers sufferings inspired countess verna as the wife and mother of martyrs had done what candida longed to do she had given her utmost to italy there must have been moments when the selfabsorption of her grief chilled her daughters ardent spirit but candida revered in her mother the image of their afflicted country it was too terrible she said speaking of what the countess had suffered after emilios death all the circumstances were too unmerciful it seemed as if god had turned his face from my mother as if she had been singled out to suffer more than any of the others all the other families received some message or token of farewell from the prisoners one of them bribed the gaoler to carry a letter another sent a lock of hair by the chaplain but emilio made no sign sent no word my mother felt as though he had turned his back on us she used to sit for hours saying again and again why was he the only one to forget his mother i tried to comfort her but it was useless she had suffered too much now i never reason with her i listen and let her ease her poor heart do you know she still asks me sometimes if i think he may have left a letter if there is no way of finding out if he left one she forgets that i have tried again and again that i have sent bribes and messages to the gaoler the chaplain to every one who came near him the answer is always the same no one has ever heard of a letter i suppose the poor boy was stunned and did not think of writing who knows what was passing through his poor bewildered brain but it would have been a great help to my mother to have a word from him if i had known how to imitate his writing i should have forged a letter i knew enough of the italians to understand how her boys silence must have aggravated the countesss grief precious as a message from a dying son would be to any mother such signs of tenderness have to the italians a peculiar significance the latin race is rhetorical it possesses the gift of deathbed eloquence the knack of saying the effective thing on momentous occasions the letters which the italian patriots sent home from their prisons or from the scaffold are not the halting farewells that anguish would have wrung from a less expressive race they are veritable compositions saved from affectation only by the fact that fluency and sonority are a part of the latin inheritance such letters passed from hand to hand among the bereaved families were not only a comfort to the survivors but an incentive to fresh sacrifices they were the seed of the martyrs with which italy was being sown and i knew what it meant to the countess verna to have no such treasure in her bosom to sit silent while other mothers quoted their sons last words i said just now that it was an unlucky day for me when i fell in love with donna candida and no doubt you have guessed the reason she was in love with some one else it was the old situation of heines song that other loved another loved italy and with an undivided passion his name was fernando briga and at that time he was one of the foremost liberals in italy he came of a middleclass modenese family his father was a doctor a prudent man engrossed in his profession and unwilling to compromise it by meddling in politics his irreproachable attitude won the confidence of the government and the duke conferred on him the sinister office of physician to the prisons of modena it was this briga who attended emilio falco and several of the other prisoners who were executed at the same time under shelter of his fathers loyalty young fernando conspired in safety he was studying medicine and every one supposed him to be absorbed in his work but as a matter of fact he was fast ripening into one of mazzinis ablest lieutenants his career belongs to history so i need not enlarge on it here in he was in milan and had become one of the leading figures in the liberal group which was working for a coalition with piedmont like all the ablest men of his day he had cast off mazziniism and pinned his faith to the house of savoy the austrian government had an eye on him but he had inherited his fathers prudence though he used it for nobler ends and his discretion enabled him to do far more for the cause than a dozen enthusiasts could have accomplished no one understood this better than donna candida she had a share of his caution and he trusted her with secrets which he would not have confided to many men her drawingroom was the centre of the piedmontese party yet so clever was she in averting suspicion that more than one hunted conspirator hid in her house and was helped across the alps by her agents briga relied on her as he did on no one else but he did not love her and she knew it still she was young she was handsome and he loved no one else how could she give up hoping from her intimate friends she made no secret of her feelings italian women are not reticent in such matters and donna candida was proud of loving a hero you will see at once that i had no chance but if she could not give up hope neither could i perhaps in her desire to secure my services for the cause she may have shown herself overkind or perhaps i was still young enough to set down to my own charms a success due to quite different causes at any rate i persuaded myself that if i could manage to do something conspicuous for italy i might yet make her care for me with such an incentive you will not wonder that i worked hard but though donna candida was full of gratitude she continued to adore my rival one day we had a hot scene i began i believe by reproaching her with having led me on and when she defended herself i retaliated by taunting her with brigas indifference she grew pale at that and said it was enough to love a hero even without hope of return and as she said it she herself looked so heroic so radiant so unattainably the woman i wanted that a sneer may have escaped me was she so sure then that briga was a hero i remember her proud silence and our wretched parting i went away feeling that at last i had really lost her and the thought made me savage and vindictive soon after as it happened came the five days and milan was free i caught a distant glimpse of donna candida in the hospital to which i was carried after the fight but my wound was a slight one and in twentyfour hours i was about again on crutches i hoped she might send for me but she did not and i was too sulky to make the first advance a day or two later i heard there had been a commotion in modena and not being in fighting trim i got leave to go over there with one or two men whom the modenese liberals had called in to help them when we arrived the precious duke had been swept out and a provisional government set up one of my companions who was a modenese was made a member and knowing that i wanted something to do he commissioned me to look up some papers in the ducal archives it was fascinating work for in the pursuit of my documents i uncovered the hidden springs of his late highnesss paternal administration the principal papers relative to the civil and criminal administration of modena have since been published and the world knows how that estimable sovereign cared for the material and spiritual welfare of his subjects well in the course of my search i came across a file of old papers marked taken from political prisoners ad it was the year of menottis conspiracy and everything connected with that date was thrilling i loosened the band and ran over the letters suddenly i came across one which was docketed given by doctor brigas son to the warder of his highnesss prisons doctor brigas son that could be no other than fernando i knew he was an only child but how came such a paper into his hands and how had it passed from them into those of the dukes warder my own hands shook as i opened the letter i felt the man suddenly in my power then i began to read my adored mother even in this lowest circle of hell all hearts are not closed to pity and i have been given the hope that these last words of farewell may reach you my eyes ran on over pages of plaintive rhetoric embrace for me my adored candidalet her never forget the cause for which her father and brother perishedlet her keep alive in her breast the thought of spielberg and reggio do not grieve that i die so young though not with those heroes in deed i was with them in spirit and am worthy to be enrolled in the sacred phalanx and so on before i reached the signature i knew the letter was from emilio verna i put it in my pocket finished my work and started immediately for milan i didnt quite know what i meant to do my head was in a whirl i saw at once what must have happened fernando briga then a lad of fifteen or sixteen had attended his father in prison during emilio vernas last hours and the latter perhaps aware of the lads liberal sympathies had found an opportunity of giving him the letter but why had briga given it up to the warder that was the puzzling question the docket said given by doctor brigas son but it might mean taken from fernando might have been seen to receive the letter and might have been searched on leaving the prison but that would not account for his silence afterward how was it that if he knew of the letter he had never told emilios family of it there was only one explanation if the letter had been taken from him by force he would have had no reason for concealing its existence and his silence was clear proof that he had given it up voluntarily no doubt in the hope of standing well with the authorities but then he was a traitor and a coward the patriot of fortyeight had begun life as an informer but does innate character ever change so radically that the lad who has committed a base act at fifteen may grow up into an honorable man a good man may be corrupted by life but can the years turn a born sneak into a hero you may fancy how i answered my own questionsif briga had been false and cowardly then was he not sure to be false and cowardly still in those days there were traitors under every coat and more than one brave fellow had been sold to the police by his best friendyou will say that brigas record was unblemished that he had exposed himself to danger too frequently had stood by his friends too steadfastly to permit of a rational doubt of his good faith so reason might have told me in a calmer moment but she was not allowed to make herself heard just then i was young i was angry i chose to think i had been unfairly treated and perhaps at my rivals instigation it was not unlikely that briga knew of my love for donna candida and had encouraged her to use it in the good cause was she not always at his bidding my blood boiled at the thought and reaching milan in a rage i went straight to donna candida i had measured the exact force of the blow i was going to deal the triumph of the liberals in modena had revived public interest in the unsuccessful struggle of their predecessors the men who sixteen years earlier had paid for the same attempt with their lives the victors of fortyeight wished to honor the vanquished of thirtytwo all the families exiled by the ducal government were hastening back to recover possession of their confiscated property and of the graves of their dead already it had been decided to raise a monument to menotti and his companions there were to be speeches garlands a public holiday the thrill of the commemoration would run through europe you see what it would have meant to the poor countess to appear on the scene with her boys letter in her hand and you see also what the memorandum on the back of the letter would have meant to donna candida poor emilios farewell would be published in all the journals of europe the finding of the letter would be on every ones lips and how conceal those fatal words on the back at the moment it seemed to me that fortune could not have given me a handsomer chance of destroying my rival than in letting me find the letter which he stood convicted of having suppressed my sentiment was perhaps not a strictly honorable one yet what could i do but give the letter to donna candida to keep it back was out of the question and with the best will in the world i could not have erased brigas name from the back the mistake i made was in thinking it lucky that the paper had fallen into my hands donna candida was alone when i entered we had parted in anger but she held out her hand with a smile of pardon and asked what news i brought from modena the smile exasperated me i felt as though she were trying to get me into her power again i bring you a letter from your brother i said and handed it to her i had purposely turned the superscription downward so that she should not see it she uttered an incredulous cry and tore the letter open a light struck up from it into her face as she read a radiance that smote me to the soul for a moment i longed to snatch the paper from her and efface the name on the back it hurt me to think how shortlived her happiness must be then she did a fatal thing she came up to me caught my two hands and kissed them oh thank you bless you a thousand times he died thinking of us he died loving italy i put her from me gently it was not the kiss i wanted and the touch of her lips hardened me she shone on me through her happy tears what happiness what consolation you have brought my poor mother this will take the bitterness from her grief and that it should come to her now do you know she had a presentiment of it when we heard of the dukes flight her first word was now we may find emilios letter at heart she was always sure that he had written i suppose some blessed instinct told her so she dropped her face on her hands and i saw her tears fall on the wretched letter in a moment she looked up again with eyes that blessed and trusted me tell me where you found it she said i told her oh the savages they took it from him my opportunity had come no i said it appears they did not take it from him then how i waited a moment the letter i said looking full at her was given up to the warder of the prison by the son of doctor briga she stared repeating the words slowly the son of doctor briga but that is fernando she said i have always understood i replied that your friend was an only son i had expected an outcry of horror if she had uttered it i could have forgiven her anything but i heard instead an incredulous exclamation my statement was really too preposterous i saw that her mind had flashed back to our last talk and that she charged me with something too nearly true to be endurable my brothers letter given to the prison warder by fernando briga my dear captain alingdon on what authority do you expect me to believe such a tale her incredulity had in it an evident implication of bad faith and i was stung to a quick reply if you will turn over the letter you will see she continued to gaze at me a moment then she obeyed i dont think i ever admired her more than i did then as she read the name a tremor crossed her face and that was all her mind must have reached out instantly to the farthest consequences of the discovery but the long habit of selfcommand enabled her to steady her muscles at once if i had not been on the alert i should have seen no hint of emotion for a while she looked fixedly at the back of the letter then she raised her eyes to mine can you tell me who wrote this she asked her composure irritated me she had rallied all her forces to brigas defence and i felt as though my triumph were slipping from me probably one of the clerks of the archives i answered it is written in the same hand as all the other memoranda relating to the political prisoners of that year but it is a lie she exclaimed he was never admitted to the prisons are you sure how should he have been he might have gone as his fathers assistant but if he had seen my poor brother he would have told me long ago not if he had really given up this letter i retorted i supposed her quick intelligence had seized this from the first but i saw now that it came to her as a shock she stood motionless clenching the letter in her hands and i could guess the rapid travel of her thoughts suddenly she came up to me colonel alingdon she said you have been a good friend of mine though i think you have not liked me lately but whether you like me or not i know you will not deceive me on your honor do you think this memorandum may have been written later than the letter i hesitated if she had cried out once against briga i should have wished myself out of the business but she was too sure of him on my honor i said i think it hardly possible the ink has faded to the same degree she made a rapid comparison and folded the letter with a gesture of assent it may have been written by an enemy i went on wishing to clear myself of any appearance of malice she shook her head he was barely fifteen and his father was on the side of the government besides this would have served him with the government and the liberals would never have known of it this was unanswerable and still not a word of revolt against the man whose condemnation she was pronouncing then i said with a vague gesture she caught me up then you have answered my objections i returned your objections to thinking that signor briga could have begun his career as a patriot by betraying a friend i had brought her to the test at last but my eyes shrank from her face as i spoke there was a dead silence which i broke by adding lamely but no doubt signor briga could explain she lifted her head and i saw that my triumph was to be short she stood erect a few paces from me resting her hand on a table but not for support of course he can explain she said do you suppose i ever doubted it but she paused a moment fronting me nobly he need not for i understand it all now ah i murmured with a last flicker of irony i understand she repeated it was she now who sought my eyes and held them it is quite simple he could not have done otherwise this was a little too oracular to be received with equanimity i suppose i smiled he could not have done otherwise she repeated with tranquil emphasis he merely did what is every italians duty he put italy before himself and his friends she waited a moment and then went on with growing passion surely you must see what i mean he was evidently in the prison with his father at the time of my poor brothers death emilio perhaps guessed that he was a friend or perhaps appealed to him because he was young and looked kind but dont you see how dangerous it would have been for briga to bring this letter to us or even to hide it in his fathers house it is true that he was not yet suspected of liberalism but he was already connected with young italy and it is just because he managed to keep himself so free of suspicion that he was able to do such good work for the cause she paused and then went on with a firmer voice you dont know the danger we all lived in the government spies were everywhere the laws were set aside as the duke pleased was not emilio hanged for having an ode to italy in his desk after menottis conspiracy the duke grew mad with fear he was haunted by the dread of assassination the police to prove their zeal had to trump up false charges and arrest innocent persons you remember the case of poor ricci incriminating papers were smuggled into peoples houses they were condemned to death on the paid evidence of brigands and galleyslaves the families of the revolutionists were under the closest observation and were shunned by all who wished to stand well with the government if briga had been seen going into our house he would at once have been suspected if he had hidden emilios letter at home its discovery might have ruined his family as well as himself it was his duty to consider all these things in those days no man could serve two masters and he had to choose between endangering the cause and failing to serve a friend he chose the latter and he was right i stood listening fascinated by the rapidity and skill with which she had built up the hypothesis of brigas defence but before she ended a strange thing happened her argument had convinced me it seemed to me quite likely that briga had in fact been actuated by the motives she suggested i suppose she read the admission in my face for hers lit up victoriously you see she exclaimed ah it takes one brave man to understand another perhaps i winced a little at being thus coupled with her hero at any rate some last impulse of resistance made me say i should be quite convinced if briga had only spoken of the letter afterward if brave people understand each other i cannot see why he should have been afraid of telling you the truth she colored deeply and perhaps not quite resentfully you are right she said he need not have been afraid but he does not know me as i know him i was useful to italy and he may have feared to risk my friendship you are the most generous woman i ever knew i exclaimed she looked at me intently you also are generous she said i stiffened instantly suspecting a purpose behind her praise i have given you small proof of it i said she seemed surprised in bringing me this letter what else could you do she sighed deeply you can give me proof enough now she had dropped into a chair and i saw that we had reached the most difficult point in our interview captain alingdon she said does any one else know of this letter no i was alone in the archives when i found it and you spoke of it to no one to no one then no one must know i bowed it is for you to decide she paused not even my mother she continued with a painful blush i looked at her in amazement not even she shook her head sadly you think me a cruel daughter well he was a cruel friend what he did was done for italy shall i allow myself to be surpassed i felt a pang of commiseration for the mother but you will at least tell the countess her eyes filled with tears my poor mother dont make it more difficult for me but i dont understand dont you see that she might find it impossible to forgive him she has suffered so much and i cant risk that for in her anger she might speak and even if she forgave him she might be tempted to show the letter dont you see that even now a word of this might ruin him i will trust his fate to no one if italy needed him then she needs him far more today she stood before me magnificently in the splendor of her great refusal then she turned to the writingtable at which she had been seated when i came in her sealingtaper was still alight and she held her brothers letter to the flame i watched her in silence while it burned but one more question rose to my lips you will tell him then what you have done for him i cried and at that the heroine turned woman melted and pressed unhappy hands in mine dont you see that i can never tell him what i do for him that is my gift to italy she said the dilettante it was on an impulse hardly needing the arguments he found himself advancing in its favor that thursdale on his way to the club turned as usual into mrs vervains street the as usual was his own qualification of the act a convenient way of bridging the interval in days and other sequences that lay between this visit and the last it was characteristic of him that he instinctively excluded his call two days earlier with ruth gaynor from the list of his visits to mrs vervain the special conditions attending it had made it no more like a visit to mrs vervain than an engraved dinner invitation is like a personal letter yet it was to talk over his call with miss gaynor that he was now returning to the scene of that episode and it was because mrs vervain could be trusted to handle the talking over as skilfully as the interview itself that at her corner he had felt the dilettantes irresistible craving to take a last look at a work of art that was passing out of his possession on the whole he knew no one better fitted to deal with the unexpected than mrs vervain she excelled in the rare art of taking things for granted and thursdale felt a pardonable pride in the thought that she owed her excellence to his training early in his career thursdale had made the mistake at the outset of his acquaintance with a lady of telling her that he loved her and exacting the same avowal in return the latter part of that episode had been like the long walk back from a picnic when one has to carry all the crockery one has finished using it was the last time thursdale ever allowed himself to be encumbered with the debris of a feast he thus incidentally learned that the privilege of loving her is one of the least favors that a charming woman can accord and in seeking to avoid the pitfalls of sentiment he had developed a science of evasion in which the woman of the moment became a mere implement of the game he owed a great deal of delicate enjoyment to the cultivation of this art the perils from which it had been his refuge became naively harmless was it possible that he who now took his easy way along the levels had once preferred to gasp on the raw heights of emotion youth is a highcolored season but he had the satisfaction of feeling that he had entered earlier than most into that chiaroscuro of sensation where every halftone has its value as a promoter of this pleasure no one he had known was comparable to mrs vervain he had taught a good many women not to betray their feelings but he had never before had such fine material to work in she had been surprisingly crude when he first knew her capable of making the most awkward inferences of plunging through thin ice of recklessly undressing her emotions but she had acquired under the discipline of his reticences and evasions a skill almost equal to his own and perhaps more remarkable in that it involved keeping time with any tune he played and reading at sight some uncommonly difficult passages it had taken thursdale seven years to form this fine talent but the result justified the effort at the crucial moment she had been perfect her way of greeting miss gaynor had made him regret that he had announced his engagement by letter it was an evasion that confessed a difficulty a deviation implying an obstacle where by common consent it was agreed to see none it betrayed in short a lack of confidence in the completeness of his method it had been his pride never to put himself in a position which had to be quitted as it were by the back door but here as he perceived the main portals would have opened for him of their own accord all this and much more he read in the finished naturalness with which mrs vervain had met miss gaynor he had never seen a better piece of work there was no overeagerness no suspicious warmth above all and this gave her art the grace of a natural quality there were none of those damnable implications whereby a woman in welcoming her friends betrothed may keep him on pins and needles while she laps the lady in complacency so masterly a performance indeed hardly needed the offset of miss gaynors doorstep words to be so kind to me how she must have liked you though he caught himself wishing it lay within the bounds of fitness to transmit them as a final tribute to the one woman he knew who was unfailingly certain to enjoy a good thing it was perhaps the one drawback to his new situation that it might develop good things which it would be impossible to hand on to margaret vervain the fact that he had made the mistake of underrating his friends powers the consciousness that his writing must have betrayed his distrust of her efficiency seemed an added reason for turning down her street instead of going on to the club he would show her that he knew how to value her he would ask her to achieve with him a feat infinitely rarer and more delicate than the one he had appeared to avoid incidentally he would also dispose of the interval of time before dinner ever since he had seen miss gaynor off an hour earlier on her return journey to buffalo he had been wondering how he should put in the rest of the afternoon it was absurd how he missed the girlyes that was it the desire to talk about her was after all at the bottom of his impulse to call on mrs vervain it was absurd if you like but it was delightfully rejuvenating he could recall the time when he had been afraid of being obvious now he felt that this return to the primitive emotions might be as restorative as a holiday in the canadian woods and it was precisely by the girls candor her directness her lack of complications that he was taken the sense that she might say something rash at any moment was positively exhilarating if she had thrown her arms about him at the station he would not have given a thought to his crumpled dignity it surprised thursdale to find what freshness of heart he brought to the adventure and though his sense of irony prevented his ascribing his intactness to any conscious purpose he could but rejoice in the fact that his sentimental economies had left him such a large surplus to draw upon mrs vervain was at home as usual when one visits the cemetery one expects to find the angel on the tombstone and it struck thursdale as another proof of his friends good taste that she had been in no undue haste to change her habits the whole house appeared to count on his coming the footman took his hat and overcoat as naturally as though there had been no lapse in his visits and the drawingroom at once enveloped him in that atmosphere of tacit intelligence which mrs vervain imparted to her very furniture it was a surprise that in this general harmony of circumstances mrs vervain should herself sound the first false note you she exclaimed and the book she held slipped from her hand it was crude certainly unless it were a touch of the finest art the difficulty of classifying it disturbed thursdales balance why not he said restoring the book isnt it my hour and as she made no answer he added gently unless its some one elses she laid the book aside and sank back into her chair mine merely she said i hope that doesnt mean that youre unwilling to share it with you by no means youre welcome to my last crust he looked at her reproachfully do you call this the last she smiled as he dropped into the seat across the hearth its a way of giving it more flavor he returned the smile a visit to you doesnt need such condiments she took this with just the right measure of retrospective amusement ah but i want to put into this one a very special taste she confessed her smile was so confident so reassuring that it lulled him into the imprudence of saying why should you want it to be different from what was always so perfectly right she hesitated doesnt the fact that its the last constitute a difference the last my last visit to you oh metaphorically i mean theres a break in the continuity decidedly she was pressing too hard unlearning his arts already i dont recognize it he said unless you make me he added with a note that slightly stirred her attitude of languid attention she turned to him with grave eyes you recognize no difference whatever none except an added link in the chain an added link in having one more thing to like you for your letting miss gaynor see why i had already so many he flattered himself that this turn had taken the least hint of fatuity from the phrase mrs vervain sank into her former easy pose was it that you came for she asked almost gaily if it is necessary to have a reason that was one to talk to me about miss gaynor to tell you how she talks about you that will be very interesting especially if you have seen her since her second visit to me her second visit thursdale pushed his chair back with a start and moved to another she came to see you again this morning yes by appointment he continued to look at her blankly you sent for her i didnt have to she wrote and asked me last night but no doubt you have seen her since thursdale sat silent he was trying to separate his words from his thoughts but they still clung together inextricably i saw her off just now at the station and she didnt tell you that she had been here again there was hardly time i suppose there were people about he floundered ah shell write then he regained his composure of course shell write very often i hope you know im absurdly in love he cried audaciously she tilted her head back looking up at him as he leaned against the chimneypiece he had leaned there so often that the attitude touched a pulse which set up a throbbing in her throat oh my poor thursdale she murmured i suppose its rather ridiculous he owned and as she remained silent he added with a sudden break or have you another reason for pitying me her answer was another question have you been back to your rooms since you left her since i left her at the station i came straight here ah yes you could there was no reason her words passed into a silent musing thursdale moved nervously nearer you said you had something to tell me perhaps i had better let her do so there may be a letter at your rooms a letter what do you mean a letter from her what has happened his paleness shook her and she raised a hand of reassurance nothing has happened perhaps that is just the worst of it you always hated you know she added incoherently to have things happen you never would let them and now well that was what she came here for i supposed you had guessed to know if anything had happened had happened he gazed at her slowly between you and me he said with a rush of light the words were so much cruder than any that had ever passed between them that the color rose to her face but she held his startled gaze you know girls are not quite as unsophisticated as they used to be are you surprised that such an idea should occur to her his own color answered hers it was the only reply that came to him mrs vervain went on smoothly i supposed it might have struck you that there were times when we presented that appearance he made an impatient gesture a mans past is his own perhaps it certainly never belongs to the woman who has shared it but one learns such truths only by experience and miss gaynor is naturally inexperienced of course but supposing her act a natural one he floundered lamentably among his innuendoes i still dont see how there was anything anything to take hold of there wasnt well then escaped him in crude satisfaction but as she did not complete the sentence he went on with a faltering laugh she can hardly object to the existence of a mere friendship between us but she does said mrs vervain thursdale stood perplexed he had seen on the previous day no trace of jealousy or resentment in his betrothed he could still hear the candid ring of the girls praise of mrs vervain if she were such an abyss of insincerity as to dissemble distrust under such frankness she must at least be more subtle than to bring her doubts to her rival for solution the situation seemed one through which one could no longer move in a penumbra and he let in a burst of light with the direct query wont you explain what you mean mrs vervain sat silent not provokingly as though to prolong his distress but as if in the attenuated phraseology he had taught her it was difficult to find words robust enough to meet his challenge it was the first time he had ever asked her to explain anything and she had lived so long in dread of offering elucidations which were not wanted that she seemed unable to produce one on the spot at last she said slowly she came to find out if you were really free thursdale colored again free he stammered with a sense of physical disgust at contact with such crassness yes if i had quite done with you she smiled in recovered security it seems she likes clear outlines she has a passion for definitions yes well he said wincing at the echo of his own subtlety well and when i told her that you had never belonged to me she wanted me to define my status to know exactly where i had stood all along thursdale sat gazing at her intently his hand was not yet on the clue and even when you had told her that even when i had told her that i had had no status that i had never stood anywhere in any sense she meant said mrs vervain slowly even then she wasnt satisfied it seems he uttered an uneasy exclamation she didnt believe you you mean i mean that she did believe me too thoroughly well then in gods name what did she want something more those were the words she used something more between between you and me is it a conundrum he laughed awkwardly girls are not what they were in my day they are no longer forbidden to contemplate the relation of the sexes so it seems he commented but since in this case there wasnt any he broke off catching the dawn of a revelation in her gaze thats just it the unpardonable offence has been in our not offending he flung himself down despairingly i give it up what did you tell her he burst out with sudden crudeness the exact truth if i had only known she broke off with a beseeching tenderness wont you believe that i would still have lied for you lied for me why on earth should you have lied for either of us to save you to hide you from her to the last as ive hidden you from myself all these years she stood up with a sudden tragic import in her movement you believe me capable of that dont you if i had only guessed but i have never known a girl like her she had the truth out of me with a spring the truth that you and i had never had never never in all these years oh she knew why she measured us both in a flash she didnt suspect me of having haggled with you her words pelted me like hail he just took what he wanted sifted and sorted you to suit his taste burnt out the gold and left a heap of cinders and you let him you let yourself be cut in bits she mixed her metaphors a little be cut in bits and used or discarded while all the while every drop of blood in you belonged to him but hes shylock and you have bled to death of the pound of flesh he has cut out of you but she despises me the most you know far the most mrs vervain ended the words fell strangely on the scented stillness of the room they seemed out of harmony with its setting of afternoon intimacy the kind of intimacy on which at any moment a visitor might intrude without perceptibly lowering the atmosphere it was as though a grand operasinger had strained the acoustics of a private musicroom thursdale stood up facing his hostess half the room was between them but they seemed to stare close at each other now that the veils of reticence and ambiguity had fallen his first words were characteristic she does despise me then he exclaimed she thinks the pound of flesh you took was a little too near the heart he was excessively pale please tell me exactly what she said of me she did not speak much of you she is proud but i gather that while she understands love or indifference her eyes have never been opened to the many intermediate shades of feeling at any rate she expressed an unwillingness to be taken with reservations she thinks you would have loved her better if you had loved some one else first the point of view is original she insists on a man with a past oh a past if shes serious i could rake up a past he said with a laugh so i suggested but she has her eyes on his particular portion of it she insists on making it a test case she wanted to know what you had done to me and before i could guess her drift i blundered into telling her thursdale drew a difficult breath i never supposed your revenge is complete he said slowly he heard a little gasp in her throat my revenge when i sent for you to warn you to save you from being surprised as i was surprised youre very good but its rather late to talk of saving me he held out his hand in the mechanical gesture of leavetaking how you must care for i never saw you so dull was her answer dont you see that its not too late for me to help you and as he continued to stare she brought out sublimely take the rest in imagination let it at least be of that much use to you tell her i lied to her shes too ready to believe it and so after all in a sense i shant have been wasted his stare hung on her widening to a kind of wonder she gave the look back brightly unblushingly as though the expedient were too simple to need oblique approaches it was extraordinary how a few words had swept them from an atmosphere of the most complex dissimulations to this contact of naked souls it was not in thursdale to expand with the pressure of fate but something in him cracked with it and the rift let in new light he went up to his friend and took her hand you would do it you would do it she looked at him smiling but her hand shook goodby he said kissing it goodby you are going to get my letter your letter the letter wont matter if you will only do what i ask he returned her gaze i might i suppose without being out of character only dont you see that if your plan helped me it could only harm her harm her to sacrifice you wouldnt make me different i shall go on being what i have always been sifting and sorting as she calls it do you want my punishment to fall on her she looked at him long and deeply ah if i had to choose between you you would let her take her chance but i cant you see i must take my punishment alone she drew her hand away sighing oh there will be no punishment for either of you for either of us there will be the reading of her letter for me she shook her head with a slight laugh there will be no letter thursdale faced about from the threshold with fresh life in his look no letter you dont mean i mean that shes been with you since i saw her shes seen you and heard your voice if there is a letter she has recalled it from the first station by telegraph he turned back to the door forcing an answer to her smile but in the mean while i shall have read it he said the door closed on him and she hid her eyes from the dreadful emptiness of the room the quicksand i as mrs quentins victoria driving homeward turned from the park into fifth avenue she divined her sons tall figure walking ahead of her in the twilight his long stride covered the ground more rapidly than usual and she had a premonition that if he were going home at that hour it was because he wanted to see her mrs quentin though not a fanciful woman was sometimes aware of a sixth sense enabling her to detect the faintest vibrations of her sons impulses she was too shrewd to fancy herself the one mother in possession of this faculty but she permitted herself to think that few could exercise it more discreetly if she could not help overhearing alans thoughts she had the courage to keep her discoveries to herself the tact to take for granted nothing that lay below the surface of their spoken intercourse she knew that most people would rather have their letters read than their thoughts for this superfeminine discretion alan repaid her by being alan there could have been no completer reward he was the key to the meaning of life the justification of what must have seemed as incomprehensible as it was odious had it not allsufficingly ended in himself he was a perfect son and mrs quentin had always hungered for perfection her house in a minor way bore witness to the craving one felt it to be the result of a series of eliminations there was nothing fortuitous in its blending of line and color the almost morbid finish of every material detail of her life suggested the possibility that a diversity of energies had by some pressure of circumstance been forced into the channel of a narrow dilettanteism mrs quentins fastidiousness had indeed the flaw of being too onesided her friends were not always worthy of the chairs they sat in and she overlooked in her associates defects she would not have tolerated in her bricabrac her house was in fact never so distinguished as when it was empty and it was at its best in the warm firelit silence that now received her her son who had overtaken her on the doorstep followed her into the drawingroom and threw himself into an armchair near the fire while she laid off her furs and busied herself about the tea table for a while neither spoke but glancing at him across the kettle his mother noticed that he sat staring at the embers with a look she had never seen on his face though its arrogant young outline was as familiar to her as her own thoughts the look extended itself to his negligent attitude to the droop of his long fine hands the dejected tilt of his head against the cushions it was like the moral equivalent of physical fatigue he looked as he himself would have phrased it deadbeat played out such an air was so foreign to his usual bright indomitableness that mrs quentin had the sense of an unfamiliar presence in which she must observe herself must raise hurried barriers against an alien approach it was one of the drawbacks of their excessive intimacy that any break in it seemed a chasm she was accustomed to let his thoughts circle about her before they settled into speech and she now sat in motionless expectancy as though a sound might frighten them away at length without turning his eyes from the fire he said im so glad youre a nice oldfashioned intuitive woman its painful to see them think her apprehension had already preceded him hope fenno she faltered he nodded shes been thinking hard it was very painful to me at least and i dont believe she enjoyed it she said she didnt he stretched his feet to the fire the result of her cogitations is that she wont have me she arrived at this by pure ratiocination its not a question of feeling you understand im the only man shes ever loved but she wont have me what novels did you read when you were young dear im convinced it all turns on that if shed been brought up on trollope and whytemelville instead of tolstoi and mrs ward we should have now been vulgarly sitting on a sofa trying on the engagementring mrs quentin at first was kept silent by the mothers instinctive anger that the girl she has not wanted for her son should have dared to refuse him then she said tell me dear my good woman she has scruples scruples against the paper she objects to me in my official capacity as owner of the radiator his mother did not echo his laugh she had found a solution of course she overflows with expedients i was to chuck the paper and we were to live happily ever afterward on canned food and virtue she even had an alternative ready women are so full of resources i was to turn the radiator into an independent organ and run it at a loss to show the public what a model newspaper ought to be on the whole i think she fancied this plan more than the other it commended itself to her as being more uncomfortable and aggressive its not the fashion nowadays to be good by stealth mrs quentin said to herself i didnt know how much he cared aloud she murmured you must give her time time to move out the old prejudices and make room for new ones my dear mother those she has are brandnew thats the trouble with them shes tremendously uptodate she takes in all the moral fashionpapers and wears the newest thing in ethics her resentment lost its way in the intricacies of his metaphor is she so very religious you dear archaic woman shes hopelessly irreligious thats the difficulty you can make a religious woman believe almost anything theres the habit of credulity to work on but when a girls faith in the deluge has been shaken its very hard to inspire her with confidence she makes you feel that before believing in you its her duty as a conscientious agnostic to find out whether youre not obsolete or whether the text isnt corrupt or somebody hasnt proved conclusively that you never existed anyhow mrs quentin was again silent the two moved in that atmosphere of implications and assumptions where the lightest word may shake down the dust of countless stored impressions and speech was sometimes more difficult between them than had their union been less close presently she ventured its impossible impossible she seemed to use her words cautiously like weapons that might slip and inflict a cut what she suggests her son raising himself turned to look at her for the first time their glance met in a shock of comprehension he was with her against the girl then her satisfaction overflowed in a murmur of tenderness of course not dear one cant change change ones life ones self he emended thats what i tell her whats the use of my giving up the paper if i keep my point of view the psychological distinction attracted her which is it she minds most oh the paper for the present she undertakes to modify the point of view afterward all she asks is that i shall renounce my heresy the gift of grace will come later mrs quentin sat gazing into her untouched cup her sons first words had produced in her the hallucinated sense of struggling in the thick of a crowd that he could not see it was horrible to feel herself hemmed in by influences imperceptible to him yet if anything could have increased her misery it would have been the discovery that her ghosts had become visible as though to divert his attention she precipitately asked and you his answer carried the shock of an evocation i merely asked her what she thought of you of me she admires you immensely you know for a moment mrs quentins cheek showed the lingering light of girlhood praise transmitted by her son acquired something of the transmitters merit well she smiled well you didnt make my father give up the radiator did you his mother stiffening made a circuitous return she never comes here how can she know me shes so poor she goes out so little he rose and leaned against the mantelpiece dislodging with impatient fingers a slender bronze wrestler poised on a porphyry base between two warmtoned spanish ivories and then her mother he added as if involuntarily her mother has never visited me mrs quentin finished for him he shrugged his shoulders mrs fenno has the scope of a wax doll her rule of conduct is taken from her grandmothers sampler but the daughter is so modern and yet the result is the same not exactly she admires you oh immensely he replaced the bronze and turned to his mother with a smile arent you on some hospital committee together what especially strikes her is your way of doing good she says philanthropy is not a line of conduct but a state of mind and it appears that you are one of the elect as in the vague diffusion of physical pain relief seems to come with the acuter pang of a single nerve mrs quentin felt herself suddenly eased by a rush of anger against the girl if she loved you she began his gesture checked her im not asking you to get her to do that the two were again silent facing each other in the disarray of a common catastrophe as though their thoughts at the summons of danger had rushed naked into action mrs quentin at this revealing moment saw for the first time how many elements of her sons character had seemed comprehensible simply because they were familiar as in reading a foreign language we take the meaning of certain words for granted till the context corrects us often as in a given case her maternal musings had figured his conduct she now found herself at a loss to forecast it and with this failure of intuition came a sense of the subserviency which had hitherto made her counsels but the anticipation of his wish her despair escaped in the moan what is it you ask me to talk to her talk to her show her tell her make her understand that the paper has always been a thing outside your life that hasnt touched you that neednt touch her only let her hear you watch you be with you shell seeshe cant help seeing his mother faltered but if shes given you her reasons let her give them to you if she can when she sees you his impatient hand again displaced the wrestler i care abominably he confessed ii on the fenno threshold a sudden sense of the futility of the attempt had almost driven mrs quentin back to her carriage but the door was already opening and a parlormaid who believed that miss fenno was in led the way to the depressing drawingroom it was the kind of room in which no member of the family is likely to be found except after dinner or after death the chairs and tables looked like poor relations who had repaid their keep by a long career of grudging usefulness they seemed banded together against intruders in a sullen conspiracy of discomfort mrs quentin keenly susceptible to such influences read failure in every angle of the upholstery she was incapable of the vulgar error of thinking that hope fenno might be induced to marry alan for his money but between this assumption and the inference that the girls imagination might be touched by the finer possibilities of wealth good taste admitted a distinction the fenno furniture however presented to such reasoning the obtuseness of its blackwalnut chamferings and something in its attitude suggested that its owners would be as uncompromising the room showed none of the modern attempts at palliation no apologetic draping of facts and mrs quentin provisionally perched on a greenreps gothic sofa with which it was clearly impossible to establish any closer relations concluded that had mrs fenno needed another seat of the same size she would have set out placidly to match the one on which her visitor now languished to mrs quentins fancy hope fennos opinions presently imparted in a clear young voice from the opposite angle of the gothic sofa partook of the character of their surroundings the girls mind was like a large light empty place scantily furnished with a few massive prejudices not designed to add to any ones comfort but too ponderous to be easily moved mrs quentins own intelligence in which its owner in an artistically shaded halflight had so long moved amid a delicate complexity of sensations seemed in comparison suddenly close and crowded and in taking refuge there from the glare of the young girls candor the older woman found herself stumbling in an unwonted obscurity her uneasiness resolved itself into a sense of irritation against her listener mrs quentin knew that the momentary value of any argument lies in the capacity of the mind to which it is addressed and as her shafts of persuasion spent themselves against miss fennos obduracy she said to herself that since conduct is governed by emotions rather than ideas the really strong people are those who mistake their sensations for opinions viewed in this light miss fenno was certainly very strong there was an unmistakable ring of finality in the tone with which she declared its impossible mrs quentins answer veiled the least shade of feminine resentment i told alan that where he had failed there was no chance of my making an impression hope fenno laid on her visitors an almost reverential hand dear mrs quentin its the impression you make that confirms the impossibility mrs quentin waited a moment she was perfectly aware that where her feelings were concerned her sense of humor was not to be relied on do i make such an odious impression she asked at length with a smile that seemed to give the girl her choice of two meanings you make such a beautiful one its too beautiful it obscures my judgment mrs quentin looked at her thoughtfully would it be permissible i wonder for an older woman to suggest that at your age it isnt always a misfortune to have what one calls ones judgment temporarily obscured miss fenno flushed i try not to judge others you judge alan ah he is not others she murmured with an accent that touched the older woman you judge his mother i dont i dont mrs quentin pressed her point you judge yourself then as you would be in my position and your verdict condemns me how can you think it its because i appreciate the difference in our point of view that i find it so difficult to defend myself against what the temptation to imagine that i might be as you are feeling as i do mrs quentin rose with a sigh my child in my day love was less subtle she added after a moment alan is a perfect son ah that again that makes it worse worse just as your goodness does your sweetness your immense indulgence in letting me discuss things with you in a way that must seem almost an impertinence mrs quentins smile was not without irony you must remember that i do it for alan thats what i love you for the girl instantly returned and again her tone touched her listener and yet youre sacrificing him and to an idea isnt it to ideas that all the sacrifices that were worth while have been made one may sacrifice ones self miss fennos color rose thats what im doing she said gently mrs quentin took her hand i believe you are she answered and it isnt true that i speak only for alan perhaps i did when i began but now i want to plead for you too against yourself she paused and then went on with a deeper note i have let you as you say speak your mind to me in terms that some women might have resented because i wanted to show you how little as the years go on theories ideas abstract conceptions of life weigh against the actual against the particular way in which life presents itself to us to women especially to decide beforehand exactly how one ought to behave in given circumstances is like deciding that one will follow a certain direction in crossing an unexplored country afterward we find that we must turn out for the obstacles cross the rivers where theyre shallowest take the tracks that others have beaten make all sorts of unexpected concessions life is made up of compromises that is what youth refuses to understand ive lived long enough to doubt whether any real good ever came of sacrificing beautiful facts to even more beautiful theories do i seem casuistical i dont know there may be losses either waybut the love of the man one lovesof the child one loves that makes up for everything she had spoken with a thrill which seemed to communicate itself to the hand her listener had left in hers her eyes filled suddenly but through their dimness she saw the girls lips shape a last desperate denial dont you see its because i feel all this that i mustnt that i cant iii mrs quentin in the late spring afternoon had turned in at the doors of the metropolitan museum she had been walking in the park in a solitude oppressed by the everpresent sense of her sons trouble and had suddenly remembered that some one had added a beltraffio to the collection it was an old habit of mrs quentins to seek in the enjoyment of the beautiful the distraction that most of her acquaintances appeared to find in each others company she had few friends and their society was welcome to her only in her more superficial moods but she could drug anxiety with a picture as some women can soothe it with a bonnet during the six months that had elapsed since her visit to miss fenno she had been conscious of a pain of which she had supposed herself no longer capable as a man will continue to feel the ache of an amputated arm she had fancied that all her centres of feeling had been transferred to alan but she now found herself subject to a kind of dual suffering in which her individual pang was the keener in that it divided her from her sons alan had surprised her she had not foreseen that he would take a sentimental rebuff so hard his disappointment took the uncommunicative form of a sterner application to work he threw himself into the concerns of the radiator with an aggressiveness that almost betrayed itself in the paper mrs quentin never read the radiator but from the glimpses of it reflected in the other journals she gathered that it was at least not being subjected to the moral reconstruction which had been one of miss fennos alternatives mrs quentin never spoke to her son of what had happened she was superior to the cheap satisfaction of avenging his injury by depreciating its cause she knew that in sentimental sorrows such consolations are as salt in the wound the avoidance of a subject so vividly present to both could not but affect the closeness of their relation an invisible presence hampered their liberty of speech and thought the girl was always between them and to hide the sense of her intrusion they began to be less frequently together it was then that mrs quentin measured the extent of her isolation had she ever dared to forecast such a situation she would have proceeded on the conventional theory that her sons suffering must draw her nearer to him and this was precisely the relief that was denied her alans uncommunicativeness extended below the level of speech and his mother reduced to the helplessness of deadreckoning had not even the solace of adapting her sympathy to his needs she did not know what he felt his course was incalculable to her she sometimes wondered if she had become as incomprehensible to him and it was to find a moments refuge from the dogging misery of such conjectures that she had now turned in at the museum the long line of mellow canvases seemed to receive her into the rich calm of an autumn twilight she might have been walking in an enchanted wood where the footfall of care never sounded so deep was the sense of seclusion that as she turned from her prolonged communion with the new beltraffio it was a surprise to find she was not alone a young lady who had risen from the central ottoman stood in suspended flight as mrs quentin faced her the older woman was the first to regain her selfpossession miss fenno she said the girl advanced with a blush as it faded mrs quentin noticed a change in her there had always been something bright and bannerlike in her aspect but now her look drooped and she hung at halfmast as it were mrs quentin in the embarrassment of surprising a secret that its possessor was doubtless unconscious of betraying reverted hurriedly to the beltraffio i came to see this she said its very beautiful miss fennos eye travelled incuriously over the mystic blue reaches of the landscape i suppose so she assented adding after another tentative pause you come here often dont you very often mrs quentin answered i find pictures a great help a help a rest i meanif one is tired or out of sorts ah miss fenno murmured looking down this beltraffio is new you know mrs quentin continued what a wonderful background isnt it is he a painter who interests you the girl glanced again at the dusky canvas as though in a final endeavor to extract from it a clue to the consolations of art i dont know she said at length im afraid i dont understand pictures she moved nearer to mrs quentin and held out her hand youre going yes mrs quentin looked at her let me drive you home she said impulsively she was feeling with a shock of surprise that it gave her after all no pleasure to see how much the girl had suffered miss fenno stiffened perceptibly thank you i shall like the walk mrs quentin dropped her hand with a corresponding movement of withdrawal and a momentary wave of antagonism seemed to sweep the two women apart then as mrs quentin bowing slightly again addressed herself to the picture she felt a sudden touch on her arm mrs quentin the girl faltered i really came here because i saw your carriage her eyes sank and then fluttered back to her hearers face ive been horribly unhappy she exclaimed mrs quentin was silent if hope fenno had expected an immediate response to her appeal she was disappointed the older womans face was like a veil dropped before her thoughts ive thought so often the girl went on precipitately of what you said that day you came to see me last autumn i think i understand now what you meant what you tried to make me see oh mrs quentin she broke out i didnt mean to tell you this i never dreamed of it till this moment but you do remember what you said dont you you must remember it and now that ive met you in this way i cant help telling you that i believe i begin to believe that you were right after all mrs quentin had listened without moving but now she raised her eyes with a slight smile do you wish me to say this to alan she asked the girl flushed but her glance braved the smile would he still care to hear it she said fearlessly mrs quentin took momentary refuge in a renewed inspection of the beltraffio then turning she said with a kind of reluctance he would still care ah broke from the girl during this exchange of words the two speakers had drifted unconsciously toward one of the benches mrs quentin glanced about her a custodian who had been hovering in the doorway sauntered into the adjoining gallery and they remained alone among the silvery vandykes and flushed bituminous halses mrs quentin sank down on the bench and reached a hand to the girl sit by me she said miss fenno dropped beside her in both women the stress of emotion was too strong for speech the girl was still trembling and mrs quentin was the first to regain her composure you say youve suffered she began at last do you suppose i havent i knew you had that made it so much worse for me that i should have been the cause of your suffering for alan mrs quentin drew a deep breath not for alan only she said miss fenno turned on her a wondering glance not for alan only that pain every woman expects and knows how to bear we all know our children must have such disappointments and to suffer with them is not the deepest pain its the suffering apart in ways they dont understand she breathed deeply i want you to know what i mean you were right that day and i was wrong oh the girl faltered mrs quentin went on in a voice of passionate lucidity i knew it then i knew it even while i was trying to argue with you ive always known it i didnt want my son to marry you till i heard your reasons for refusing him and then then i longed to see you his wife oh mrs quentin i longed for it but i knew it mustnt be mustnt be mrs quentin shook her head sadly and the girl gaining courage from this mute negation cried with an uncontrollable escape of feeling its because you thought me hard obstinate narrowminded oh i understand that so well my selfrighteousness must have seemed so petty a girl who could sacrifice a mans future to her own moral vanity for it was a form of vanity you showed me that plainly enough how you must have despised me but i am not that girl now indeed im not im not impulsive i think things out ive thought this out i know alan loves me i know how he loves me and i believe i can help him oh not in the ways i had fancied before but just merely by loving him she paused but mrs quentin made no sign i see it all so differently now i see what an influence love itself may be how my believing in him loving him accepting him just as he is might help him more than any theories any arguments i might have seen this long ago in looking at you as he often told me in seeing how youd kept yourself apart from from mr quentins work and his been always the beautiful side of life to them kept their faith alive in spite of themselves not by interfering preaching reforming but by just loving them and being there she looked at mrs quentin with a simple nobleness it isnt as if i cared for the money you know if i cared for that i should be afraid you will care for it in time mrs quentin said suddenly miss fenno drew back releasing her hand in time yes when theres nothing else left she stared a moment at the pictures my poor child she broke out ive heard all you say so often before youve heard it yes from myself i felt as you do i argued as you do i acted as i mean to prevent your doing when i married alans father the long empty gallery seemed to reverberate with the girls startled exclamation oh mrs quentin hush let me speak do you suppose id do this if you were the kind of pinkandwhite idiot he ought to have married its because i see youre alive as i was tingling with beliefs ambitions energies as i was that i cant see you walled up alive as i was without stretching out a hand to save you she sat gazing rigidly forward her eyes on the pictures speaking in the low precipitate tone of one who tries to press the meaning of a lifetime into a few breathless sentences when i met alans father she went on i knew nothing of his his work we met abroad where i had been living with my mother that was twentysix years ago when the radiator was less less notorious than it is now i knew my husband owned a newspaper a great newspaper and nothing more i had never seen a copy of the radiator i had no notion what it stood for in politics or in other ways we were married in europe and a few months afterward we came to live here people were already beginning to talk about the radiator my husband on leaving college had bought it with some money an old uncle had left him and the public at first was merely curious to see what an ambitious stirring young man without any experience of journalism was going to make out of his experiment they found first of all that he was going to make a great deal of money out of it i found that out too i was so happy in other ways that it didnt make much difference at first though it was pleasant to be able to help my mother to be generous and charitable to live in a nice house and wear the handsome gowns he liked to see me in but still it didnt really count it counted so little that when one day i learned what the radiator was i would have gone out into the streets barefooted rather than live another hour on the money it brought in her voice sank and she paused to steady it the girl at her side did not speak or move i shall never forget that day she began again the paper had stripped bare some family scandal some miserable bleeding secret that a dozen unhappy people had been struggling to keep out of print that would have been kept out if my husband had not oh you must guess the rest i cant go on she felt a hand on hers you mustnt go on mrs quentin the girl whispered yes i must i must you must be made to understand she drew a deep breath my husband was not like alan when he found out how i felt about it he was surprised at first but gradually he began to see or at least i fancied he saw the hatefulness of it at any rate he saw how i suffered and he offered to give up the whole thing to sell the paper it couldnt be done all of a sudden of course he made me see that for he had put all his money in it and he had no special aptitude for any other kind of work he was a born journalist like alan it was a great sacrifice for him to give up the paper but he promised to do it in time when a good opportunity offered meanwhile of course he wanted to build it up to increase the circulation and to do that he had to keep on in the same way he made that clear to me i saw that we were in a vicious circle the paper to sell well had to be made more and more detestable and disgraceful at first i rebelled but somehow i cant tell you how it was after that first concession the ground seemed to give under me with every struggle i sank deeper and then then alan was born he was such a delicate baby that there was very little hope of saving him but money did it the money from the paper i took him abroad to see the best physicians i took him to a warm climate every winter in hot weather the doctors recommended sea air and we had a yacht and cruised every summer i owed his life to the radiator and when he began to grow stronger the habit was formed the habit of luxury he could not get on without the things he had always been used to he pined in bad air he drooped under monotony and discomfort he throve on variety amusement travel every kind of novelty and excitement and all i wanted for him his inexhaustible fostermother was there to give my husband said nothing but he must have seen how things were going there was no more talk of giving up the radiator he never reproached me with my inconsistency but i thought he must despise me and the thought made me reckless i determined to ignore the paper altogether to take what it gave as though i didnt know where it came from and to excuse this i invented the theory that one may so to speak purify money by putting it to good uses i gave away a great deal in charity i indulged myself very little at first all the money that was not spent on alan i tried to do good with but gradually as my boy grew up the problem became more complicated how was i to protect alan from the contamination i had let him live in i couldnt preach by example couldnt hold up his father as a warning or denounce the money we were living on all i could do was to disguise the inner ugliness of life by making it beautiful outside to build a wall of beauty between him and the facts of life turn his tastes and interests another way hide the radiator from him as a smiling woman at a ball may hide a cancer in her breast just as alan was entering college his father died then i saw my way clear i had loved my husband and yet i drew my first free breath in years for the radiator had been left to alan outright there was nothing on earth to prevent his selling it when he came of age and there was no excuse for his not selling it i had brought him up to depend on money but the paper had given us enough money to gratify all his tastes at last we could turn on the monster that had nourished us i felt a savage joy in the thought i could hardly bear to wait till alan came of age but i had never spoken to him of the paper and i didnt dare speak of it now some false shame kept me back some vague belief in his ignorance i would wait till he was twentyone and then we should be free i waited the day came and i spoke you can guess his answer i suppose he had no idea of selling the radiator it wasnt the money he cared for it was the career that tempted him he was a born journalist and his ambition ever since he could remember had been to carry on his fathers work to develop to surpass it there was nothing in the world as interesting as modern journalism he couldnt imagine any other kind of life that wouldnt bore him to death a newspaper like the radiator might be made one of the biggest powers on earth and he loved power and meant to have all he could get i listened to him in a kind of trance i couldnt find a word to say his father had had scruples he had none i seemed to realize at once that argument would be useless i dont know that i even tried to plead with him he was so bright and hard and inaccessible then i saw that he was after all what i had made him the creature of my concessions my connivances my evasions that was the price i had paid for him i had kept him at that cost well i had kept him at any rate that was the feeling that survived he was my boy my son my very own till some other woman took him meanwhile the old life must go on as it could i gave up the struggle if at that point he was inaccessible at others he was close to me he has always been a perfect son our tastes grew together we enjoyed the same books the same pictures the same people all i had to do was to look at him in profile to see the side of him that was really mine at first i kept thinking of the dreadful other side but gradually the impression faded and i kept my mind turned from it as one does from a deformity in a face one loves i thought i had made my last compromise with life had hit on a modus vivendi that would last my time and then he met you i had always been prepared for his marrying but not a girl like you i thought he would choose a sweet thing who would never pry into his closets he hated women with ideas but as soon as i saw you i knew the struggle would have to begin again he is so much stronger than his father he is full of the most monstrous convictions and he has the courage of them too you saw last year that his love for you never made him waver he believes in his work he adores it it is a kind of hideous idol to which he would make human sacrifices he loves you still ive been honest with you but his love wouldnt change him it is you who would have to change to die gradually as i have died till there is only one live point left in me ah if one died completely thats simple enough but something persists remember that a single point an aching nerve of truth now and then you may drug it but a touch wakes it again as your face has waked it in me theres always enough of ones old self left to suffer with she stood up and faced the girl abruptly what shall i tell alan she said miss fenno sat motionless her eyes on the ground twilight was falling on the gallery a twilight which seemed to emanate not so much from the glass dome overhead as from the crepuscular depths into which the faces of the pictures were receding the custodians step sounded warningly down the corridor when the girl looked up she was alone a venetian nights entertainment i this is the story that in the diningroom of the old beacon street house now the aldebaran club judge anthony bracknell of the famous east india firm of bracknell saulsbee when the ladies had withdrawn to the oval parlour and marias harp was throwing its gauzy web of sound across the common used to relate to his grandsons about the year that buonaparte marched upon moscow i him venice said the lascar with the big earrings and tony bracknell leaning on the high gunwale of his fathers east indiaman the hepzibah b saw far off across the morning sea a faint vision of towers and domes dissolved in golden air it was a rare february day of the year and a young tony newly of age and bound on the grand tour aboard the crack merchantman of old bracknells fleet felt his heart leap up as the distant city trembled into shape venice the name since childhood had been a magicians wand to him in the hall of the old bracknell house at salem there hung a series of yellowing prints which uncle richard saulsbee had brought home from one of his long voyages views of heathen mosques and palaces of the grand turks seraglio of st peters church in rome and in a corner the corner nearest the rack where the old flintlocks hung a busy merry populous scene entitled st marks square in venice this picture from the first had singularly taken little tonys fancy his unformulated criticism on the others was that they lacked action true in the view of st peters an experiencedlooking gentleman in a fullbottomed wig was pointing out the fairly obvious monument to a bashful companion who had presumably not ventured to raise his eyes to it while at the doors of the seraglio a group of turbaned infidels observed with less hesitancy the approach of a veiled lady on a camel but in venice so many things were happening at once more tony was sure than had ever happened in boston in a twelvemonth or in salem in a long lifetime for here by their garb were people of every nation on earth chinamen turks spaniards and many more mixed with a particoloured throng of gentry lacqueys chapmen hucksters and tall personages in parsons gowns who stalked through the crowd with an air of mastery a string of parasites at their heels and all these people seemed to be diverting themselves hugely chaffering with the hucksters watching the antics of trained dogs and monkeys distributing doles to maimed beggars or having their pockets picked by slipperylooking fellows in black the whole with such an air of ease and goodhumour that one felt the cutpurses to be as much a part of the show as the tumbling acrobats and animals as tony advanced in years and experience this childish mumming lost its magic but not so the early imaginings it had excited for the old picture had been but the springboard of fancy the first step of a cloudladder leading to a land of dreams with these dreams the name of venice remained associated and all that observation or report subsequently brought him concerning the place seemed on a sober warranty of fact to confirm its claim to stand midway between reality and illusion there was for instance a slender venice glass goldpowdered as with lilypollen or the dust of sunbeams that standing in the corner cabinet betwixt two lowestoft caddies seemed among its lifeless neighbours to palpitate like an impaled butterfly there was farther a gold chain of his mothers spun of that same sunpollen so threadlike impalpable that it slipped through the fingers like light yet so strong that it carried a heavy pendant which seemed held in air as if by magic magic that was the word which the thought of venice evoked it was the kind of place tony felt in which things elsewhere impossible might naturally happen in which two and two might make five a paradox elope with a syllogism and a conclusion give the lie to its own premiss was there ever a young heart that did not once and again long to get away into such a world as that tony at least had felt the longing from the first hour when the axioms in his hornbook had brought home to him his heavy responsibilities as a christian and a sinner and now here was his wish taking shape before him as the distant haze of gold shaped itself into towers and domes across the morning sea the reverend ozias mounce tonys governor and bearleader was just putting a hand to the third clause of the fourth part of a sermon on freewill and predestination as the hepzibah bs anchor rattled overboard tony in his haste to be ashore would have made one plunge with the anchor but the reverend ozias on being roused from his lucubrations earnestly protested against leaving his argument in suspense what was the trifle of an arrival at some papistical foreign city where the very churches wore turbans like so many moslem idolators to the important fact of mr mounces summing up his conclusions before the muse of theology took flight he should be happy he said if the tide served to visit venice with mr bracknell the next morning the next morning ha tony murmured a submissive yes sir winked at the subjugated captain buckled on his sword pressed his hat down with a flourish and before the reverend ozias had arrived at his next deduction was skimming merrily shoreward in the hepzibahs gig a moment more and he was in the thick of it here was the very world of the old print only suffused with sunlight and colour and bubbling with merry noises what a scene it was a square enclosed in fantastic painted buildings and peopled with a throng as fantastic a bawling laughing jostling sweating mob particoloured partispeeched crackling and sputtering under the hot sun like a dish of fritters over a kitchen fire tony agape shouldered his way through the press aware at once that spite of the tumult the shrillness the gesticulation there was no undercurrent of clownishness no tendency to horseplay as in such crowds on marketday at home but a kind of facetious suavity which seemed to include everybody in the circumference of one huge joke in such an air the sense of strangeness soon wore off and tony was beginning to feel himself vastly at home when a lift of the tide bore him against a drolllooking bellringing fellow who carried above his head a tall metal tree hung with sherbetglasses the encounter set the glasses spinning and three or four spun off and clattered to the stones the sherbetseller called on all the saints and tony clapping a lordly hand to his pocket tossed him a ducat by mistake for a sequin the fellows eyes shot out of their orbits and just then a personablelooking young man who had observed the transaction stepped up to tony and said pleasantly in english i perceive sir that you are not familiar with our currency does he want more says tony very lordly whereat the other laughed and replied you have given him enough to retire from his business and open a gaminghouse over the arcade tony joined in the laugh and this incident bridging the preliminaries the two young men were presently hobnobbing over a glass of canary in front of one of the coffeehouses about the square tony counted himself lucky to have run across an englishspeaking companion who was goodnatured enough to give him a clue to the labyrinth and when he had paid for the canary in the coin his friend selected they set out again to view the town the italian gentleman who called himself count rialto appeared to have a very numerous acquaintance and was able to point out to tony all the chief dignitaries of the state the men of ton and ladies of fashion as well as a number of other characters of a kind not openly mentioned in taking a census of salem tony who was not averse from reading when nothing better offered had perused the merchant of venice and mr otways fine tragedy but though these pieces had given him a notion that the social usages of venice differed from those at home he was unprepared for the surprising appearance and manners of the great people his friend named to him the gravest senators of the republic went in prodigious striped trousers short cloaks and feathered hats one nobleman wore a ruff and doctors gown another a black velvet tunic slashed with rosecolour while the president of the dreaded council of ten was a terrible strutting fellow with a rapierlike nose a buff leather jerkin and a trailing scarlet cloak that the crowd was careful not to step on it was all vastly diverting and tony would gladly have gone on forever but he had given his word to the captain to be at the landingplace at sunset and here was dusk already creeping over the skies tony was a man of honour and having pressed on the count a handsome damascened dagger selected from one of the goldsmiths shops in a narrow street lined with such wares he insisted on turning his face toward the hepzibahs gig the count yielded reluctantly but as they came out again on the square they were caught in a great throng pouring toward the doors of the cathedral they go to benediction said the count a beautiful sight with many lights and flowers it is a pity you cannot take a peep at it tony thought so too and in another minute a legless beggar had pulled back the leathern flap of the cathedral door and they stood in a haze of gold and perfume that seemed to rise and fall on the mighty undulations of the organ here the press was as thick as without and as tony flattened himself against a pillar he heard a pretty voice at his elbow oh sir oh sir your sword he turned at sound of the broken english and saw a girl who matched the voice trying to disengage her dress from the tip of his scabbard she wore one of the voluminous black hoods which the venetian ladies affected and under its projecting eaves her face spied out at him as sweet as a nesting bird in the dusk their hands met over the scabbard and as she freed herself a shred of her lace flounce clung to tonys enchanted fingers looking after her he saw she was on the arm of a pompouslooking graybeard in a long black gown and scarlet stockings who on perceiving the exchange of glances between the young people drew the lady away with a threatening look the count met tonys eye with a smile one of our venetian beauties said he the lovely polixena cador she is thought to have the finest eyes in venice she spoke english stammered tony oh ah precisely she learned the language at the court of saint jamess where her father the senator was formerly accredited as ambassador she played as an infant with the royal princes of england and that was her father assuredly young ladies of donna polixenas rank do not go abroad save with their parents or a duenna just then a soft hand slid into tonys his heart gave a foolish bound and he turned about halfexpecting to meet again the merry eyes under the hood but saw instead a slender brown boy in some kind of fanciful pages dress who thrust a folded paper between his fingers and vanished in the throng tony in a tingle glanced surreptitiously at the count who appeared absorbed in his prayers the crowd at the ringing of a bell had in fact been overswept by a sudden wave of devotion and tony seized the moment to step beneath a lighted shrine with his letter i am in dreadful trouble and implore your help polixena he read but hardly had he seized the sense of the words when a hand fell on his shoulder and a sternlooking man in a cocked hat and bearing a kind of rod or mace pronounced a few words in venetian tony with a start thrust the letter in his breast and tried to jerk himself free but the harder he jerked the tighter grew the others grip and the count presently perceiving what had happened pushed his way through the crowd and whispered hastily to his companion for gods sake make no struggle this is serious keep quiet and do as i tell you tony was no chickenheart he had something of a name for pugnacity among the lads of his own age at home and was not the man to stand in venice what he would have resented in salem but the devil of it was that this black fellow seemed to be pointing to the letter in his breast and this suspicion was confirmed by the counts agitated whisper this is one of the agents of the ten for gods sake no outcry he exchanged a word or two with the macebearer and again turned to tony you have been seen concealing a letter about your person and what of that says tony furiously gently gently my master a letter handed to you by the page of donna polixena cador a black business oh a very black business this cador is one of the most powerful nobles in venice i beseech you not a word sir let me think deliberate his hand on tonys shoulder he carried on a rapid dialogue with the potentate in the cocked hat i am sorry sir but our young ladies of rank are as jealously guarded as the grand turks wives and you must be answerable for this scandal the best i can do is to have you taken privately to the palazzo cador instead of being brought before the council i have pleaded your youth and inexperience tony winced at this and i think the business may still be arranged meanwhile the agent of the ten had yielded his place to a sharpfeatured shabbylooking fellow in black dressed somewhat like a lawyers clerk who laid a grimy hand on tonys arm and with many apologetic gestures steered him through the crowd to the doors of the church the count held him by the other arm and in this fashion they emerged on the square which now lay in darkness save for the many lights twinkling under the arcade and in the windows of the gamingrooms above it tony by this time had regained voice enough to declare that he would go where they pleased but that he must first say a word to the mate of the hepzibah who had now been awaiting him some two hours or more at the landingplace the count repeated this to tonys custodian but the latter shook his head and rattled off a sharp denial impossible sir said the count i entreat you not to insist any resistance will tell against you in the end tony fell silent with a rapid eye he was measuring his chances of escape in wind and limb he was more than a mate for his captors and boyhoods ruses were not so far behind him but he felt himself equal to outwitting a dozen grown men but he had the sense to see that at a cry the crowd would close in on him space was what he wanted a clear ten yards and he would have laughed at doge and council but the throng was thick as glue and he walked on submissively keeping his eye alert for an opening suddenly the mob swerved aside after some new show tonys fist shot out at the black fellows chest and before the latter could right himself the young new englander was showing a clean pair of heels to his escort on he sped cleaving the crowd like a floodtide in gloucester bay diving under the first arch that caught his eye dashing down a lane to an unlit waterway and plunging across a narrow humpback bridge which landed him in a black pocket between walls but now his pursuers were at his back reinforced by the yelping mob the walls were too high to scale and for all his courage tonys breath came short as he paced the masonry cage in which illluck had landed him suddenly a gate opened in one of the walls and a slip of a servant wench looked out and beckoned him there was no time to weigh chances tony dashed through the gate his rescuer slammed and bolted it and the two stood in a narrow paved well between high houses ii the servant picked up a lantern and signed to tony to follow her they climbed a squalid stairway of stone felt their way along a corridor and entered a tall vaulted room feebly lit by an oillamp hung from the painted ceiling tony discerned traces of former splendour in his surroundings but he had no time to examine them for a figure started up at his approach and in the dim light he recognized the girl who was the cause of all his troubles she sprang toward him with outstretched hands but as he advanced her face changed and she shrank back abashed this is a misunderstanding a dreadful misunderstanding she cried out in her pretty broken english oh how does it happen that you are here through no choice of my own madam i assure you retorted tony not overpleased by his reception but why how how did you make this unfortunate mistake why madam if youll excuse my candour i think the mistake was yours mine in sending me a letter you a letter by a simpleton of a lad who must needs hand it to me under your fathers very nose the girl broke in on him with a cry what it was you who received my letter she swept round on the little maidservant and submerged her under a flood of venetian the latter volleyed back in the same jargon and as she did so tonys astonished eye detected in her the doubleted page who had handed him the letter in saint marks what he cried the lad was this girl in disguise polixena broke off with an irrepressible smile but her face clouded instantly and she returned to the charge this wicked careless girl she has ruined me she will be my undoing oh sir how can i make you understand the letter was not intended for you it was meant for the english ambassador an old friend of my mothers from whom i hoped to obtain assistance oh how can i ever excuse myself to you no excuses are needed madam said tony bowing though i am surprised i own that any one should mistake me for an ambassador here a wave of mirth again overran polixenas face oh sir you must pardon my poor girls mistake she heard you speaking english and and i had told her to hand the letter to the handsomest foreigner in the church tony bowed again more profoundly the english ambassador polixena added simply is a very handsome man i wish madam i were a better proxy she echoed his laugh and then clapped her hands together with a look of anguish fool that i am how can i jest at such a moment i am in dreadful trouble and now perhaps i have brought trouble on you also oh my father i hear my father coming she turned pale and leaned tremblingly upon the little servant footsteps and loud voices were in fact heard outside and a moment later the redstockinged senator stalked into the room attended by halfadozen of the magnificoes whom tony had seen abroad in the square at sight of him all clapped hands to their swords and burst into furious outcries and though their jargon was unintelligible to the young man their tones and gestures made their meaning unpleasantly plain the senator with a start of anger first flung himself on the intruder then snatched back by his companions turned wrathfully on his daughter who at his feet with outstretched arms and streaming face pleaded her cause with all the eloquence of young distress meanwhile the other nobles gesticulated vehemently among themselves and one a truculentlooking personage in ruff and spanish cape stalked apart keeping a jealous eye on tony the latter was at his wits end how to comport himself for the lovely polixenas tears had quite drowned her few words of english and beyond guessing that the magnificoes meant him a mischief he had no notion what they would be at at this point luckily his friend count rialto suddenly broke in on the scene and was at once assailed by all the tongues in the room he pulled a long face at sight of tony but signed to the young man to be silent and addressed himself earnestly to the senator the latter at first would not draw breath to hear him but presently sobering he walked apart with the count and the two conversed together out of earshot my dear sir said the count at length turning to tony with a perturbed countenance it is as i feared and you are fallen into a great misfortune a great misfortune a great trap i call it shouted tony whose blood by this time was boiling but as he uttered the word the beautiful polixena cast such a stricken look on him that he blushed up to the forehead be careful said the count in a low tone though his illustriousness does not speak your language he understands a few words of it and so much the better broke in tony i hope he will understand me if i ask him in plain english what is his grievance against me the senator at this would have burst forth again but the count stepping between answered quickly his grievance against you is that you have been detected in secret correspondence with his daughter the most noble polixena cador the betrothed bride of this gentleman the most illustrious marquess zanipolo and he waved a deferential hand at the frowning hidalgo of the cape and ruff sir said tony if that is the extent of my offence it lies with the young lady to set me free since by her own avowal but here he stopped short for to his surprise polixena shot a terrified glance at him sir interposed the count we are not accustomed in venice to take shelter behind a ladys reputation no more are we in salem retorted tony in a white heat i was merely about to remark that by the young ladys avowal she has never seen me before polixenas eyes signalled her gratitude and he felt he would have died to defend her the count translated his statement and presently pursued his illustriousness observes that in that case his daughters misconduct has been all the more reprehensible her misconduct of what does he accuse her of sending you just now in the church of saint marks a letter which you were seen to read openly and thrust in your bosom the incident was witnessed by his illustriousness the marquess zanipolo who in consequence has already repudiated his unhappy bride tony stared contemptuously at the black marquess if his illustriousness is so lacking in gallantry as to repudiate a lady on so trivial a pretext it is he and not i who should be the object of her fathers resentment that my dear young gentleman is hardly for you to decide your only excuse being your ignorance of our customs it is scarcely for you to advise us how to behave in matters of punctilio it seemed to tony as though the count were going over to his enemies and the thought sharpened his retort i had supposed said he that men of sense had much the same behaviour in all countries and that here as elsewhere a gentleman would be taken at his word i solemnly affirm that the letter i was seen to read reflects in no way on the honour of this young lady and has in fact nothing to do with what you suppose as he had himself no notion what the letter was about this was as far as he dared commit himself there was another brief consultation in the opposing camp and the count then said we all know sir that a gentleman is obliged to meet certain enquiries by a denial but you have at your command the means of immediately clearing the lady will you show the letter to her father there was a perceptible pause during which tony while appearing to look straight before him managed to deflect an interrogatory glance toward polixena her reply was a faint negative motion accompanied by unmistakable signs of apprehension poor girl he thought she is in a worse case than i imagined and whatever happens i must keep her secret he turned to the senator with a deep bow i am not said he in the habit of showing my private correspondence to strangers the count interpreted these words and donna polixenas father dashing his hand on his hilt broke into furious invective while the marquess continued to nurse his outraged feelings aloof the count shook his head funereally alas sir it is as i feared this is not the first time that youth and propinquity have led to fatal imprudence but i need hardly i suppose point out the obligation incumbent upon you as a man of honour tony stared at him haughtily with a look which was meant for the marquess and what obligation is that to repair the wrong you have done in other words to marry the lady polixena at this burst into tears and tony said to himself why in heaven does she not bid me show the letter then he remembered that it had no superscription and that the words it contained supposing them to have been addressed to himself were hardly of a nature to disarm suspicion the sense of the girls grave plight effaced all thought of his own risk but the counts last words struck him as so preposterous that he could not repress a smile i cannot flatter myself said he that the lady would welcome this solution the counts manner became increasingly ceremonious such modesty he said becomes your youth and inexperience but even if it were justified it would scarcely alter the case as it is always assumed in this country that a young lady wishes to marry the man whom her father has selected but i understood just now tony interposed that the gentleman yonder was in that enviable position so he was till circumstances obliged him to waive the privilege in your favour he does me too much honour but if a deep sense of my unworthiness obliges me to decline you are still interrupted the count labouring under a misapprehension your choice in the matter is no more to be consulted than the ladys not to put too fine a point on it it is necessary that you should marry her within the hour tony at this for all his spirit felt the blood run thin in his veins he looked in silence at the threatening visages between himself and the door stole a sideglance at the high barred windows of the apartment and then turned to polixena who had fallen sobbing at her fathers feet and if i refuse said he the count made a significant gesture i am not so foolish as to threaten a man of your mettle but perhaps you are unaware what the consequences would be to the lady polixena at this struggling to her feet addressed a few impassioned words to the count and her father but the latter put her aside with an obdurate gesture the count turned to tony the lady herself pleads for you at what cost you do not guess but as you see it is vain in an hour his illustriousnesss chaplain will be here meanwhile his illustriousness consents to leave you in the custody of your betrothed he stepped back and the other gentlemen bowing with deep ceremony to tony stalked out one by one from the room tony heard the key turn in the lock and found himself alone with polixena iii the girl had sunk into a chair her face hidden a picture of shame and agony so moving was the sight that tony once again forgot his own extremity in the view of her distress he went and kneeled beside her drawing her hands from her face oh dont make me look at you she sobbed but it was on his bosom that she hid from his gaze he held her there a breathingspace as he might have clasped a weeping child then she drew back and put him gently from her what humiliation she lamented do you think i blame you for what has happened alas was it not my foolish letter that brought you to this plight and how nobly you defended me how generous it was of you not to show the letter if my father knew i had written to the ambassador to save me from this dreadful marriage his anger against me would be even greater ah it was that you wrote for cried tony with unaccountable relief of course what else did you think but is it too late for the ambassador to save you from you a smile flashed through her tears alas yes she drew back and hid her face again as though overcome by a fresh wave of shame tony glanced about him if i could wrench a bar out of that window he muttered impossible the court is guarded you are a prisoner alas oh i must speak she sprang up and paced the room but indeed you can scarce think worse of me than you do already i think ill of you alas you must to be unwilling to marry the man my father has chosen for me such a beetlebrowed lout it would be a burning shame if you married him ah you come from a free country here a girl is allowed no choice it is infamous i say infamous no no i ought to have resigned myself like so many others resigned yourself to that brute impossible he has a dreadful name for violence his gondolier has told my little maid such tales of him but why do i talk of myself when it is of you i should be thinking of me poor child cried tony losing his head yes and how to save you for i can save you but every moment counts and yet what i have to say is so dreadful nothing from your lips could seem dreadful ah if he had had your way of speaking well now at least you are free of him said tony a little wildly but at this she stood up and bent a grave look on him no i am not free she said but you are if you will do as i tell you tony at this felt a sudden dizziness as though from a mad flight through clouds and darkness he had dropped to safety again and the fall had stunned him what am i to do he said look away from me or i can never tell you he thought at first that this was a jest but her eyes commanded him and reluctantly he walked away and leaned in the embrasure of the window she stood in the middle of the room and as soon as his back was turned she began to speak in a quick monotonous voice as though she were reciting a lesson you must know that the marquess zanipolo though a great noble is not a rich man true he has large estates but he is a desperate spendthrift and gambler and would sell his soul for a round sum of ready money if you turn round i shall not go on he wrangled horribly with my father over my dowry he wanted me to have more than either of my sisters though one married a procurator and the other a grandee of spain but my father is a gambler too oh such fortunes as are squandered over the arcade yonder and so and so dont turn i implore you oh do you begin to see my meaning she broke off sobbing and it took all his strength to keep his eyes from her go on he said will you not understand oh i would say anything to save you you dont know us venetians were all to be bought for a price it is not only the brides who are marketable sometimes the husbands sell themselves too and they think you rich my father does and the others i dont know why unless you have shown your money too freely and the english are all rich are they not and oh oh do you understand oh i cant bear your eyes she dropped into a chair her head on her arms and tony in a flash was at her side my poor child my poor polixena he cried and wept and clasped her you are rich are you not you would promise them a ransom she persisted to enable you to marry the marquess to enable you to escape from this place oh i hope i may never see your face again she fell to weeping once more and he drew away and paced the floor in a fever presently she sprang up with a fresh air of resolution and pointed to a clock against the wall the hour is nearly over it is quite true that my father is gone to fetch his chaplain oh i implore you be warned by me there is no other way of escape and if i do as you say you are safe you are free i stake my life on it and you you are married to that villain but i shall have saved you tell me your name that i may say it to myself when i am alone my name is anthony but you must not marry that fellow you forgive me anthony you dont think too badly of me i say you must not marry that fellow she laid a trembling hand on his arm time presses she adjured him and i warn you there is no other way for a moment he had a vision of his mother sitting very upright on a sunday evening reading dr tillotsons sermons in the best parlour at salem then he swung round on the girl and caught both her hands in his yes there is he cried if you are willing polixena let the priest come she shrank back from him white and radiant oh hush be silent she said i am no noble marquess and have no great estates he cried my father is a plain india merchant in the colony of massachusetts but if you oh hush i say i dont know what your long words mean but i bless you bless you bless you on my knees and she knelt before him and fell to kissing his hands he drew her up to his breast and held her there you are willing polixena he said no no she broke from him with outstretched hands i am not willing you mistake me i must marry the marquess i tell you on my money he taunted her and her burning blush rebuked him yes on your money she said sadly why because much as you hate him you hate me still more she was silent if you hate me why do you sacrifice yourself for me he persisted you torture me and i tell you the hour is past let it pass ill not accept your sacrifice i will not lift a finger to help another man to marry you oh madman madman she murmured tony with crossed arms faced her squarely and she leaned against the wall a few feet off from him her breast throbbed under its lace and falbalas and her eyes swam with terror and entreaty polixena i love you he cried a blush swept over her throat and bosom bathing her in light to the verge of her troubled brows i love you i love you he repeated and now she was on his breast again and all their youth was in their lips but her embrace was as fleeting as a birds poise and before he knew it he clasped empty air and half the room was between them she was holding up a little coral charm and laughing i took it from your fob she said it is of no value is it and i shall not get any of the money you know she continued to laugh strangely and the rouge burned like fire in her ashen face what are you talking of he said they never give me anything but the clothes i wear and i shall never see you again anthony she gave him a dreadful look oh my poor boy my poor love i love you i love you polixena he thought she had turned lightheaded and advanced to her with soothing words but she held him quietly at arms length and as he gazed he read the truth in her face he fell back from her and a sob broke from him as he bowed his head on his hands only for gods sake have the money ready or there may be foul play here she said as she spoke there was a great tramping of steps outside and a burst of voices on the threshold it is all a lie she gasped out about my marriage and the marquess and the ambassador and the senator but not oh not about your danger in this place or about my love she breathed to him and as the key rattled in the door she laid her lips on his brow the key rattled and the door swung open but the blackcassocked gentleman who stepped in though a priest indeed was no votary of idolatrous rites but that sound orthodox divine the reverend ozias mounce looking very much perturbed at his surroundings and very much on the alert for the scarlet woman he was supported to his evident relief by the captain of the hepzibah b and the procession was closed by an escort of sternlooking fellows in cocked hats and smallswords who led between them tonys late friends the magnificoes now as sorry a looking company as the law ever landed in her net the captain strode briskly into the room uttering a grunt of satisfaction as he clapped eyes on tony so mr bracknell said he you have been seeing the carnival with this pack of mummers have you and this is where your pleasuring has landed you hm a pretty establishment and a pretty lady at the head of it he glanced about the apartment and doffed his hat with mock ceremony to polixena who faced him like a princess why my girl said he amicably i think i saw you this morning in the square on the arm of the pantaloon yonder and as for that captain spavent and he pointed a derisive finger at the marquess ive watched him drive his bullys trade under the arcade ever since i first dropped anchor in these waters well well he continued his indignation subsiding alls fair in carnival i suppose but this gentleman here is under sailing orders and i fear we must break up your little party at this tony saw count rialto step forward looking very small and explanatory and uncovering obsequiously to the captain i can assure you sir said the count in his best english that this incident is the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding and if you will oblige us by dismissing these myrmidons any of my friends here will be happy to offer satisfaction to mr bracknell and his companions mr mounce shrank visibly at this and the captain burst into a loud guffaw satisfaction says he why my cock thats very handsome of you considering the ropes at your throats but well not take advantage of your generosity for i fear mr bracknell has already trespassed on it too long you pack of galleyslaves you he spluttered suddenly decoying young innocents with that devils bait of yours his eye fell on polixena and his voice softened unaccountably ah well we must all see the carnival once i suppose he said alls well that ends well as the fellow says in the play and now if you please mr bracknell if youll take the reverend gentlemans arm there well bid adieu to our hospitable entertainers and right about face for the hepzibah end of the project gutenberg etext of the descent of man and other
