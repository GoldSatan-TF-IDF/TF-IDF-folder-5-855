the dualitists chapter i bis dat qui non cito dat he gives twice who does not give quickly there was joy in the house of bubb for ten long years had ephraim and sophonisba bubb mourned in vain the loneliness of their life unavailingly had they gazed into the emporia of babylinen and fixed their searching glances on the basketmakers warehouses where the cradles hung in tempting rows in vain had they prayed and sighed and groaned and wished and waited and wept but never had even a ray of hope been held out by the family physician but now at last the wishedfor moment had arrived month after month had flown by on leaden wings and the destined days had slowly measured their course the months had become weeks the weeks had dwindled down to days the days had been attenuated to hours the hours had lapsed into minutes the minutes had slowly died away and but seconds remained ephraim bubb sat cowering on the stairs and tried with highstrung ears to catch the strain of blissful music from the lips of his firstborn there was silence in the housesilence as of the deadly calm before the cyclone ah ephra bubb little thinkest thou that another moment may for ever destroy the peaceful happy course of thy life and open to thy too craving eyes the portals of that wondrous land where childhood reigns supreme and where the tyrant infant with the wave of his tiny hand and the imperious treble of his tiny voice sentences his parent to the deadly vault beneath the castle moat as the thought strikes thee thou becomest pale how thou tremblest as thou findest thyself upon the brink of the abyss wouldst that thou could recall the past but hark the die is cast for good or ill the long years of praying and hoping have found an end at last from the chamber within comes a sharp cry which shortly after is repeated ah ephraim that cry is the feeble effort of childish lips as yet unused to the rough worldly form of speech to frame the word father in the glow of thy transport all doubts are forgotten and when the doctor cometh forth as the harbinger of joy he findeth thee radiant with new found delight my dear sir allow me to congratulate youto offer twofold felicitations mr bubb sir you are the father of twins chapter ii halcyon days the twins were the finest children that ever were seenso at least said the cognoscenti and the parents were not slow to believe the nurses opinion was in itself a proof it was not maam that they was fine for twins but they was fine for singles and she had ought to know for she had nussed a many in her time both twins and singles all they wanted was to have their dear little legs cut off and little wings on their dear little shoulders for to be put one on each side of a white marble tombstone cut beautiful sacred to the relic of ephraim bubb that they might sir if so be that missus was to survive the father of two such lovely twinsalthough she would make bold to say and no offence intended that a handsome gentleman though a trifle or two older than his good lady though for the matter of that she heerd that gentlemen was never too old at all and for her own part she liked them the better for it not like bits of boys that didnt know their own mindsthat a gentleman what was the father of two such eavenly twins god bless them couldnt be called anything but a boy though for the matter of that she never knowed in her experiencewhich it was muchof a boy as had such twins or any twins at all so much for the matter of that the twins were the idols of their parents and at the same time their pleasure and their pain did zerubbabel cough ephraim would start from his balmy slumbers with an agonised cry of consternation for visions of innumerable twins black in the face from croup haunted his nightly pillow did zacariah rail at aethereal expansion sophonisba with pallid hue and dishevelled locks would fly to the cradle of her offspring did pins torture or strings afflict or flannel or flies tickle or light dazzle or darkness affright or hunger or thirst assail the synchronous productions the household of bubb would be roused from quiet slumbers or the current of its manifold workings changed the twins grew apace were weaned teethed and at length arrived at the stage of three years they grew in beauty side by side they filled one home etc chapter iii rumours of wars harry merford and tommy santon lived in the same range of villas as ephraim bubb harrys parents had taken up their abode in no no was happy in the perpetual sunshine of tommys smiles and between these two residences ephraim bubb reared his blossoms the number of his mansion being harry and tommy had been accustomed from the earliest times to meet each other daily their primal method of communication had been by the housetops till their respective sires had been obliged to pay compensation to bubb for damages to his roof and dormer windows and from that time they had been forbidden by the home authorities to meet whilst their mutual neighbour had taken the precaution of having his garden walls pebbledashed and topped with broken glass to prevent their incursions harry and tommy however being gifted with daring souls lofty ambitions impetuous natures and strong seats to their trousers defied the rugged walls of bubb and continued to meet in secret compared with these two youths castor and pollux damon and pythias eloisa and abelard are but tame examples of duality or constancy and friendship all the poets from hyginus to schiller might sing of noble deeds done and desperate dangers held as naught for friendships sake but they would have been mute had they but known of the mutual affection of harry and tommy day by day and often night by night would these two brave the perils of nurse and father and mother of whip and imprisonment and hunger and thirst and solitude and darkness to meet together what they discussed in secret none other knew what deeds of darkness were perpetrated in their symposia none could tell alone they met alone they remained and alone they departed to their several abodes there was in the garden of bubb a summer house overgrown with trailing plants and surrounded by young poplars which the fond father had planted on his childrens natal day and whose rapid growth he had proudly watched these trees quite obscured the summerhouse and here harry and tommy knowing after a careful observation that none ever entered the place held their conclaves time after time they met in full security and followed their customary pursuit of pleasure let us raise the mysterious veil and see what was the great unknown at whose shrine they bent the knee harry and tommy had each been given as a christmas box a new knife and for a long timenearly a yearthese knives similar in size and pattern were their chief delights with them they cut and hacked in their respective homes all things which would not be likely to be noticed for the young gentlemen were wary and had no wish that their moments of pleasure should be atoned for by moments of pain the insides of drawers and desks and boxes and underparts of tables and chairs the backs of picture frames even the floors where corners of the carpets could surreptitiously be turned up all bore marks of their craftsmanship and to compare notes on these artistic triumphs was a source of joy at length however a critical time came some new field of action should be opened up for the old appetites were sated and the old joys had begun to pall it was absolutely necessary that the existing schemes of destruction should be enlarged and yet this could hardly be done without a terrible risk of discovery for the limits of safety had long since been reached and passed but be the risk great or small some new ground should be brokensome new joy found for the old earth was barren and the craving for pleasure was growing fiercer with each successive day the crisis had come who could tell the issue chapter iv the tucket sounds they met in the arbour determined to discuss this grave question the heart of each was big with revolution the head of each was full of scheme and strategy and the pocket of each was full of sweetstuff the sweeter for being stolen after having despatched the sweets the conspirators proceeded to explain their respective views with regard to the enlargement of their artistic operations tommy unfolded with much pride a scheme which he had in contemplation of cutting a series of holes in the sounding board of the piano so as to destroy its musical properties harry was in no wise behindhand in his ideas of reform he had conceived the project of cutting the canvas at the back of his great grandfathers portrait which his father held in high regard among his lares and penates so that in time when the picture should be moved the skin of paint would be broken the head fall bodily out from the frame at this point of the council a brilliant thought occurred to tommy why should not the enjoyment be doubled and the musical instruments and family pictures of both establishments be sacrificed on the altar of pleasure this was agreed to nem con and then the meeting adjourned for dinner when they next met it was evident that there was a screw loose somewherethat there was something rotten in the state of denmark after a little fencing on both sides it came out that all the schemes of domestic reform had been foiled by maternal vigilance and that so sharp had been the reprimand consequent on a partial discovery of the schemes that they would have to be abandonedtill such time at least as increased physical strength would allow the reformers to laugh to scorn parental threats and injunctions sadly the two forlorn youths took out their knives and regarded them sadly sadly they thought as erst did othello of all the fair chances of honour and triumph and glory gone for ever they compared knives with almost the fondness of doting parents there they wereso equal in size and strength and beautydimmed by no corrosive rust tarnished by no stain and with unbroken edges of the keenness of saladins sword so like were the knives that but for the initials scratched in the handles neither boy could have been sure which was his own after a little while they began mutually to brag of the superior excellence of their respective weapons tommy insisted that his was the sharper harry asserted that his was the stronger of the two hotter and hotter grew the war of words the tempers of harry and tommy got inflamed and their boyish bosoms glowed with manly thoughts of daring and of hate but there was abroad in that hour a spirit of a bygone ageone that penetrated even to that dim arbour in the grove of bubb the worldold scheme of ordeal was whispered by the spirit in the ear of each and suddenly the tumult was allayed with one impulse the boys suggested that they should test the quality of their knives by the ordeal of the hack no sooner said than done harry held out his knife edge uppermost and tommy grasping his firmly by the handle brought down the edge of the blade crosswise on harrys the process was then reversed and harry became in turn the aggressor then they paused and eagerly looked for the result it was not hard to see in each knife were two great dents of equal depth and so it was necessary to renew the contest and seek a further proof what needs it to relate seriatim the details of that direful strife the sun had long since gone down and the moon with fair smiling face had long risen over the roof of bubb when wearied and jaded harry and tommy sought their respective homes alas the splendour of the knives was gone for ever ichabodichabod the glory had departed and naught remained but two useless wrecks with keen edges destroyed and now like unto nothing save the serried hills of spain but though they mourned for their fondly cherished weapons the hearts of the boys were glad for the bygone day had opened to their gaze a prospect of pleasure as boundless as the limits of the world chapter v the first crusade from that day a new era dawned in the lives of harry and tommy so long as the resources of the parental establishments could hold out so long would their new amusement continue subtly they obtained surreptitious possession of articles of family cutlery not in general use and brought them one by one to their rendezvous these came fair and spotless from the sanctity of the butlers pantry alas they returned not as they came but in course of time the stock of available cutlery became exhausted and again the inventive faculties of the youths were called into requisition they reasoned thus the knife game it is true is played out but the excitement of the hack is not to be dispensed with let us carry then this great idea into new worlds let us still live in the sunshine of pleasure let us continue to hack but with objects other than knives it was done not knives now engaged the attention of the ambitious youths spoons and forks were daily flattened and beaten out of shape pepper castor met pepper castor in combat and both were borne dying from the field candlesticks met in fray to part no more on this side of the grave even epergnes were used as weapons in the crusade of hack at last all the resources of the butlers pantry became exhausted and then began a system of miscellaneous destruction that proved in a little time ruinous to the furniture of the respective homes of harry and tommy mrs santon and mrs merford began to notice that the wear and tear in their households became excessive day after day some new domestic calamity seemed to have occurred today a valuable edition of some book whose luxurious binding made it an object for public display would appear to have suffered some dire misfortune for the edges were frayed and broken and the back loose if not altogether displaced tomorrow the same awful fate would seem to have followed some miniature frame the day following the legs of some chair or spidertable would show signs of extraordinary hardship even in the nursery the sounds of lamentation were heard it was a thing of daily occurrence for the little girls to state that when going to bed at night they had laid their dear dollies in their beds with tender care but that when again seeking them in the period of recess they had found them with all their beauty gone with legs and arms amputated and faces beaten from all semblance of human form then articles of crockery began to be missed the thief could in no case be discovered and the wages of the servants from constant stoppages began to be nominal rather than real mrs merford and mrs santon mourned their losses but harry and tommy gloated day after day over their spoils which lay in an everincreasing heap in the hidden grove of bubb to such an extent had the fondness of the hack now grown that with both youths it was an infatuationa madnessa frenzy at length one awful day arrived the butlers of the houses of merford and santon harassed by constant losses and complaints and finding that their breakage account was in excess of their wages determined to seek some sphere of occupation where if they did not meet with a suitable reward or recognition of their services they would at least not lose whatever fortune and reputation they had already acquired accordingly before rendering up their keys and the goods entrusted to their charge they proceeded to take a preliminary stock of their own accounts to make sure of their accredited accuracy dire indeed was their distress when they knew to the full the havoc which had been wrought terrible their anguish of the present bitter their thoughts of the future their hearts bowed down with weight of woe failed them quite reeled the strong brains that had erst overcome foes of deadlier spirit than grief and fell their stalwart forms prone on the floors of their respective sancta sanctorum late in the day when their services were required they were sought for in bower and hall and at length discovered where they lay but alas for justice they were accused of being drunk and for having whilst in that degraded condition deliberately injured all the property on which they could lay hands were not the evidences of their guilt patent to all in the hecatombs of the destroyed then they were charged with all the evils wrought in the houses and on their indignant denial harry and tommy each in his own home according to their concerted scheme of action stepped forward and relieved their minds of the deadly weight that had for long in secret borne them down the story of each ran that time after time he had seen the butler when he thought that nobody was looking knocking knives together in the pantry chairs and books and pictures in the drawingroom and study dolls in the nursery and plates in the kitchen then indeed was the master of each household stern and uncompromising in his demands for justice each butler was committed to the charge of myrmidons of the law under the double charge of drunkenness and wilful destruction of property softly and sweetly slept harry and tommy in their little beds that night angels seemed to whisper to them for they smiled as though lost in pleasant dreams the rewards given by proud and grateful parents lay in their pockets and in their hearts the happy consciousness of having done their duty truly sweet should be the slumbers of the just chapter vi let the dead past bury its dead it might be supposed that now the operations of harry and tommy would be obliged to be abandoned not so however the minds of these youths were of no common order nor were their souls of such weak nature as to yield at the first summons of necessity like nelson they knew not fear like napoleon they held impossible to be the adjective of fools and they revelled in the glorious truth that in the lexicon of youth is no such word as fail therefore on the day following the eclaircissement of the butlers misdeeds they met in the arbour to plan a new campaign in the hour when all seemed blackest to them and when the narrowing walls of possibility hedged them in on every side thus ran the deliberations of these dauntless youths we have played out the meaner things that are inanimate and inert why not then trench on the domains of life the dead have lapsed into the regions of the forgotten pastlet the living look to themselves that night they met when all households had retired to balmy sleep and naught but the amorous wailings of nocturnal cats told of the existence of life and sentience each bore into the arbour in his arms a pet rabbit and a piece of stickingplaster then in the peaceful quiet moonlight commenced a work of mystery blood and gloom the proceedings began by the fixing of a piece of stickingplaster over the mouth of each rabbit to prevent it making a noise if so inclined then tommy held up his rabbit by its scutty tail and it hung wriggling a white mass in the moonlight slowly harry raised his rabbit holding it in the same manner and when level with his head brought it down on tommys client but the chances had been miscalculated the boys held firmly to the tails but the chief portions of the rabbits fell to earth ere the doomed beasts could escape however the operators had pounced upon them and this time holding them by the hind legs renewed the trial deep into the night the game was kept up and the eastern sky began to show signs of approaching day as each boy bore triumphantly the dead corse of his favourite bunny and placed it within its sometime hutch next night the same game was renewed with a new rabbit on each side and for more than a weekso long as the hutches supplied the wherewithalthe battle was sustained true that there were sad hearts and red eyes in the juveniles of santon and merford as one by one the beloved pets were found dead but harry and tommy with the hearts of heroes steeled to suffering and deaf to the pitiful cries of childhood still fought the good fight on to the bitter end when the supply of rabbits was exhausted other munition was not wanting and for some days the war was continued with white mice dormice hedgehogs guinea pigs pigeons lambs canaries parroqueets linnets squirrels parrots marmots poodles ravens tortoises terriers and cats of these as might be expected the most difficult to manipulate were the terriers and the cats and of these two classes the proportion of the difficulties in the way of terrierhacking was when compared with those of cathacking about that which the simple lac of the british pharmacopoeia bears to water in the compound which dairymen palm off upon a too confiding public as milk more than once when engaged in the rapturous delights of cathacking had harry and tommy wished that the silent tomb could open its ponderous and massy jaws and engulf them for the feline victims were not patient in their death agonies and often broke the bonds in which the security of the artists rested and turned fiercely on their executioners at last however all the animals available were sacrificed but the passion for hacking still remained how was it all to end chapter vii a cloud with golden lining tommy and harry sat in the arbour dejected and disconsolate they wept like two alexanders because there were no more worlds to conquer at last the conviction had been forced upon them that the resources available for hacking were exhausted that very morning they had had a desperate battle and their attire showed the ravages of direful war their hats were battered into shapeless masses their shoes were soleless and heelless and had the uppers broken the ends of their braces their sleeves and their trousers were frayed and had they indulged in the manly luxury of coat tails these too would have gone truly hacking had become an absorbing passion with them long and fiercely had they been swept onward on the wings of the demon of strife and powerless at the best of times had been the promptings of good but now heated with combat maddened by the equal success of arms and with the lust for victory still unsated they longed more fiercely than ever for some new pleasure like tigers that have tasted blood they thirsted for a larger and more potent libation as they sat with their souls in a tumult of desire and despair some evil genius guided into the garden the twin blossoms of the tree of bubb hand in hand zacariah and zerubbabel advanced from the back door they had escaped from their nurses and with the exploring instinct of humanity advanced boldly into the great worldthe terra incognita the ultima thule of the paternal domain in the course of time they approached the hedge of poplars from behind which the anxious eyes of harry and tommy looked for their approach for the boys knew that where the twins were the nurses were accustomed to be gathered together and they feared discovery if their retreat should be cut off it was a touching sight these lovely babes alike in form feature size expression and dress in fact so like each other that one might not have told either from which when the startling similarity was recognised by harry and tommy each suddenly turned and grasping the other by the shoulder spoke in a keen whisper hack they are exactly equal this is the very apotheosis of our art with excited faces and trembling hands they laid their plans to lure the unsuspecting babes within the precincts of their charnel house and they were so successful in their efforts that in a little time the twins had toddled behind the hedge and were lost to the sight of the parental mansion harry and tommy were not famed for gentleness within the immediate precincts of their respective homes but it would have delighted the heart of any philanthropist to see the kindly manner in which they arranged for the pleasures of the helpless babes with smiling faces and playful words and gentle wiles they led them within the arbour and then under pretence of giving them some of those sudden jumps in which infants rejoice they raised them from the ground tommy held zacariah across his arm with his baby moonface smiling up at the cobwebs on the arbour roof and harry with a mighty effort raised the cherubic zerubbabel aloft each nerved himself for a great endeavour harry to give tommy to endure a shock and then the form of zerubbabel was seen whirling through the air round harrys glowing and determined face there was a sickening crash and the arm of tommy yielded visibly the pasty face of zerubbabel had fallen fair on that of zacariah for tommy and harry were by this time artists of too great experience to miss so simple a mark the puttylike noses collapsed the puttylike cheeks became for a moment flattened and when in an instant more they parted the faces of both were dabbled in gore immediately the firmament was rent with a series of such yells as might have awakened the dead forthwith from the house of bubb came the echoes in parental cries and footsteps as the sounds of scurrying feet rang through the mansion harry cried to tommy they will be on us soon let us cut to the roof of the stable and draw up the ladder tommy answered by a nod and the two boys regardless of consequences and bearing each a twin ascended to the roof of the stable by means of a ladder which usually stood against the wall and which they pulled up after them as ephraim bubb issued from his house in pursuit of his lost darlings the sight which met his gaze froze his very soul there on the coping of the stable roof stood harry and tommy renewing their game they seemed like two young demons forging some diabolical implement for each in turn the twins were lifted high in air and let fall with stunning force on the supine form of its fellow how ephraim felt none but a tender and imaginative father can conceive it would be enough to wring the heart of even a callous parent to see his children the darlings of his old agehis own beloved twinsbeing sacrificed to the brutal pleasure of unregenerate youths without being made unconsciously and helplessly guilty of the crime of fratricide loudly did ephraim and also sophonisba who with dishevelled locks had now appeared upon the scene bewail their unhappy lot and shriek in vain for aid but by rare illchance no eyes save their own saw the work of butchery or heard the shrieks of anguish and despair wildly did ephraim mounting on the shoulders of his spouse strive but in vain to scale the stable wall baffled in every effort he rushed into the house and appeared in a moment bearing in his hands a doublebarrelled gun into which he poured the contents of a shot pouch as he ran he came anigh the stable and hailed the murderous youths drop them twins and come down here or ill shoot you like a brace of dogs never exclaimed the heroic two with one impulse and continued their awful pastime with a zest tenfold as they knew that the agonised eyes of parents wept at the cause of their joy then die shrieked ephraim as he fired both barrels rightleft at the hackers but alas love for his darlings shook the hand that never shook before as the smoke cleared off and ephraim recovered from the kick of his gun he heard a loud twofold laugh of triumph and saw harry and tommy all unhurt waving in the air the trunks of the twinsthe fond father had blown the heads completely off his own offspring tommy and harry shrieked aloud in glee and after playing catch with the bodies for some time seen only by the agonised eyes of the infanticide and his wife flung them high in the air ephraim leaped forward to catch what had once been zacariah and sophonisba grabbed wildly for the loved remains of her zerubbabel but the weight of the bodies and the height from which they fell were not reckoned by either parent and from being ignorant of a simple dynamical formula each tried to effect an object which calm common sense united with scientific knowledge would have told them was impossible the masses fell and ephraim and sophonisba were stricken dead by the falling twins who were thus posthumously guilty of the crime of parricide an intelligent coroners jury found the parents guilty of the crimes of infanticide and suicide on the evidence of harry and tommy who swore reluctantly that the inhuman monsters maddened by drink had killed their offspring by shooting them into the air out of a cannonsince stolenwhence like curses they had fallen on their own heads and that then they had slain themselves suis manibus with their own hands accordingly ephraim and sophonisba were denied the solace of christian burial and were committed to the earth with maimed rites and had stakes driven through their middles to pin them down in their unhallowed graves till the crack of doom harry and tommy were each rewarded with national honours and were knighted even at their tender years fortune seemed to smile upon them all the long after years and they lived to a ripe old age hale of body and respected and beloved of all often in the golden summer eves when all nature seemed at rest when the oldest cask was opened and the largest lamp was lit when the chestnuts glowed in the embers and the kid turned on the spit when their greatgrandchildren pretended to mend fictional armour and to trim an imaginary helmets plume when the shuttles of the good wives of their grandchildren went flashing each through its proper loom with shouting and with laughter they were accustomed to tell the tale of the dualitists or the deathdoom of the doubleborn
