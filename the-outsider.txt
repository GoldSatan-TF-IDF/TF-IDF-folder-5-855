the outsider edgar million published by edgar million at smashwords copyright edgar million the outsider the news said it was a plot by al qaida or islamic state twitter and that shouty american bloke on youtube said it was the jews and the new world order coming to enslave us david icke probably said it was lizard people but im only guessing just because thats the sort of thing he says when people find out i was there on that terrible day they ask me who or what i thought it was certain my presence must have endowed me with some greater wisdom then when i can tell them no more than their facebook they switch to suspicion if i dont know then i must have been a part of it the inside man mostly i agree with their point of view i was there i should know what happened when i returned to my office the next day i was met with a human fist of a crowd jostling me screaming at me hungry with fascination for the terrible thing which had happened i understood their hunger if such a thing could have happened to us then it could happen to anyone we are all so fragile they bayed at me as though they were wolves howling at the moon as i rattled the heavy plateglass doors of course the doors were shut fast i should have known really after what happened why would they be open so i had to plunge back into the crowd again which was still pleading with me to know the truth i wish i knew what happened but i dont you believe me right even if you dont believe me it changes nothing i mean i know what happened i just dont understand why it happened the day was a normal day most days are you know normal i mean at least until the extraordinary happens to change it all i got into work early ive always like an early start cup of tea covered in a delicious greasy film and a bacon roll from the canteen wrapped in brown paper which looks like the stuff you would send a parcel in some days if im trying to be healthy i will substitute this with a granola covered honey yoghurt and a freshly squeezed juice but on that morning id just been to the gym and had earnt my bacon roll my early morning routine sat at my desk id spend around fortyfive minutes on the news sites and maybe tick off a few emails before the day began proper little things dont get me wrong id bust a gut the rest of the day but that hour was mine the slow boot up of my brain we sold insurance but everyone knows now that right for a while we there we were the single most infamous insurance company in the world but at that moment we were just an anonymous granite grey eight storey block of glass and steel on the edge of ilford town centre selling life insurance to the lower risk individuals than gwyneth paltrow i was in the underwriting section not needing to sully myself by actually selling false hope to the masses directly but the day ahead was mapped out in detail thats unfair we sold pretty decent product but its the english mindset isnt it did a good job selfdeprecate yourself to within an inch of your life so people know youre not too bigheaded we were a decent midrange company who most people hadnt heard of even though if you had life insurance there was a good chance the policy was underwritten by us by around nine the late shift started arriving and by ten it was the mums and dads straggling in from the school run i wouldnt mind so much but they started after me and finished before mostly but apparently they were full time still no need to be bitter not after what happened im not a man who entered the world of employment after finding my true love my true vocation but what can you do you can sit at home all day watching jeremy kyle like my cousin arrison or even be in and out of the nick like my oldest friend bodge but where or more importantly what does that get you im all for the consumerist acquisition of nice things a decent car the newest most shiny phone top end coffee maker and a car i dont drive because i take the tube unless im there working my backside off then i dont get them sure so far so shallow but i was born to the old nine to five solid job occasional work romance a nice little shared ownership flat down on beakers street who could want for anything more the office was normal too i thought the usual chessboard mix of personality types which made for a good ebb and flow not too many alpha queens just enough pawns and plenty of the inbetweeners me i was probably a knight back then thats a horsey for you nonchess playing types prone to unexpected twists and turns more useful than unskilled chess players realise these days im more of the rook solid driven focused i liked to watch the pieces move craig and rocky stood nearby and had the same conversation they always do i mean did every day about the cost of buying a property in those days even in grotty old east london and about what theyd have done differently if the couldve seen the future id have moved up north if there were any jobs i wish id bought a spare house back in the nineties better than a pension my pensions looking next to worthless ill be working until im ninety at this rate i dont know how young people will ever afford to buy i reckon my son and daughter will be at home forever this was a daily conversation a short beckett play and even with the many times they varied and reenacted it its core text is tattooed onto my memory normal normal normal day i have thought so hard about what happened searching these conversations these interplays with a forensic gaze but i come up short every time well mr jones the big scottish man said why dont you try to explain to me in your own words exactly what happened on this normal day i remember my voice rising into a shrill screech i could smell the man questioning me hed clearly been up all night and there was a pungent odour of him in the room stale sweat mixed with the faintly fruity odour of ecigarettes you know what happened you know i said why do you need me to go through this sir we need to understand what happened if youd asked me that morning how many people worked in my building id had taken a stab at around four hundred as it turned out there were exactly six hundred and eightyeight people who called insurance international home but at that point i didnt know that neither did anyone well i suppose someone did the head of hr maybe or finance but within days everyone knew as the number of dead shot up from the starting estimate of thirty souls lost reports are coming in of mass casualties outside an office block in east london currently thirty people are feared dead police have confirmed that there is no immediate evidence of terrorism but they are not ruling it out i read it all back lateron on one of those minutebyminute things on the guardian site the ones which used to be about football or other sporting events but now get dragged out for every rolling news disaster or story from bombings in syria to the resignation of the prime minister continuous bite sized updates which mostly serve to illustrate how little they know at any given point in the tragic story arc i read fifty feared dead a hundred the figure hovered around four hundred until three days later when the hospital released a firm final tally of the dead six hundred and eightyeight from a workforce of six hundred and eightynine guess who was the lucky one who beat the math from my desk on the first floor id a clear view through the open plan office then out across east london back into the centre of the city and the evergrowing number of oddly shaped towers which keep sprouting up like big empty glass daffodils all over london i knew i mean really knew about ten or so of my colleagues on the floor and maybe about a hundred casually throughout whole the building there were some friends one or two like casey up in finance who id hang out with after work you know how it is i wept with caseys wife at his funeral unable to explain why i was still there why he no longer was later i just missed him my friend missed watching sports down the pub missed arguing with him about politics the old lefty bastard sometimes i still go to message him some stupid or banal thing a politician said then i remember hes not there hes not there so it was an ordinary wednesday morning i like to listen to headphones when i work helps me to concentrate but that day i was just letting the low thrum of machine noise and conversation cover me like a blanket listening to that skinny guy from the business analysis team try to chat up carmina hassan from the health and safety unit every day he went through this routine his wire frame body arched in an effort at apparent flirtatiousness taking carminas polite laughter as a sign he had a chance before mooching off back to his hacker style nest in the corner to peek at her from between his monitors stalker but harmless enough probably anyway who knows he was persistent enough she was single i think maybe he did have a chance honestly who knows what straight women look for theyre not really my thing the female half of the species and since i tend to like my men handsome and built like proverbial brick shit houses im not much of a judge of ordinary blokes like darren but since so many women seem to settle for these oddly put together little chaps maybe his doomed love had a chance or not at about half past eleven i returned from getting a coffee to see big boss colin mccartney march into the centre of the office flanked by crowds of staff i half recognised from other floors and i briefly wondered if we were about to be downsized as he pointed to people individually come on he called its time then one by one my colleagues stood up and began to follow colin mccartney was a big brash mancunian who liked to tell people he started of working for insurance international in the postroom even though everyone knew his uncle owned the company still he was an undeniable force making men and women alike agitated in his presence nervous for attention and rare praise he didnt point at me i said to the police officer who was looking as though he were having a hard time deciding between playing nice or nasty cop so was instead settling for slightly bemused cop until he decided what kind of bastard i was maybe thats why i survived maybe it was some kind of hypnotism or mind control the policeman looked at me closely looking like he might have decided to categorise me as a bastard of the sneaky variety and what do you know about mind control sir i didnt know anything about mind control i just knew they all got up and followed him towards the stairwell at the end of the floor filtering in what my friend pc plod would have probably described as an orderly fashion i was meant to be assessing a change to the regulations for a business in bethnal green but abandoned on the floor i just sat and stared around me for a while everyone just left it was quite disconcerting why hadnt i been invited where had they gone i walked over to the stairwell and pushed open the heavy green fire doors if i listened hard i could still hear the clamour of shoes on the concrete treads far above then the silence i stood toying with the idea of following them why should i be left out what are they meeting about when i saw the first one go there in the periphery of my vision i saw them go then tried to balance it out in my mind not real i thought maybe a coat or a sweater blowing in the wind not real because it was just one at first but one was enough to draw me back out into my floor for a closer look did i really see that i wondered edging towards the window a nervous chemical pool of tension flooding my stomach before i reached the window the next one went i knew for certain this time time did that slowmo thing which i read somewhere is a result of difficult memories being written onto the amygdala to be returned in every quiet moment in every nightmare filled sleep its the difference between an engraving and a photograph the photo takes a second to create but is flimsy transient the engraving takes half an hour but its there forever permanent fixed time slowed enough to see his face as he went past colin mccartney ceo of insurance international plummeting body stiff and rotating like a diver whod just launched himself into an olympic style dive from the high board i followed his motion down to the ground crunching into the floor with a sound which i heard even through the heavy plate glass or did i just imagine i heard it i howled through the cold glass at him screamed no and banged on the window no stop no his body lay awkward and misshapen close to the other body the coat someone i didnt recognise from this strange perspective but who i would later discover was the sour faced receptionist whose name i still cant remember like so many things i feel like i should know this but i dont i feel like i should know all their names but i didnt then and dont now the sun did a four page pull out with photos of every survivor and i didnt recognise even half of them its silly to feel guilty about this but what else is there for me an old lady stood nearby on the pavement below looking at them frozen with an openmouthed look of horror on her face an english oldlady version of the scream for a moment she noticed me pressed against the glass and we shared a moment of misery but then her eyes scanned the building above me and she stepped back a short stumble at first then twisted and ran a distance away from the building dragging one of those old lady trolleys behind her bumping clumsily along the uneven paving before spinning off in a catlike crouch unbecoming of an old lady god i actually thought that at the time whys that old lady crouching like an extra from monty python then it came whats that line from the passion apres moi le deluge yeah i know louis the whatever said it first or madame de pompiedeau but i remember it from that jeanette winterson book the next one fell except they didnt fall thats what they told me afterwards thats what the witnesses who were interviewed said they jumped they stepped they werent thrown they didnt stumble they just lined up on masse along the edge of the roof and launched themselves off together in orderly rows it was a brief sad waterfall of humanity the window was dark with it for about thirty seconds suits shirts skirts standard office attire interspersed with semi recognisable faces calm in their descent i didnt see casey fall i saw carmina i saw maggie from comms and daniel from hr who i had a little thing with waybackwhen i saw the calm expressionless faces of friends then they were gone youd think that some of the latter ones might have been saved by falling onto the bodies of their colleagues a gruesome thought but gruesome thoughts are born in such moments it turns out eight storeys is really bloody high that and the fact they all seemed to be aiming for bare concrete like skydivers finding a mark so all dead six hundred and eightyeight i went upstairs i told scottish plod found the still open door leading onto a tarmac roof id never visited before but there was no one there i walked over to where they jumped from i couldnt look over the edge or i couldnt walk towards it so i just knelt down and crawled sticking my nose over the metal frame on the side seeing the bloody mass of humanity on the pavement below ambulances and police had begun arriving looking like toys far below and i battled to try and make sense of it how could this happen i went to several funerals but stopped attending the receptions because people kept getting drunk then blaming me either that or id encounter small cliques which stared at me with small beetle eyes suspicious and red rimmed how dare you be here their eyes asked me how dare you three days after it happened i got a call from the firm mr george an american voice asked yes were from head office and wed like to meet you where the voice paused considering options well it doesnt have to be in the office id rather it were i told the voice i need to come back in to try to understand like that was even possible when i arrived in reception a security guard i didnt recognise walked to the door and stared at me wearing an expression of deep mistrust but he let me pass presumably on the instructions of the yank jay who id spoken to the other day as i waited in the cool silence of the empty building i wondered for the second time in three days if i were about to lose my job seemed a reasonable assumption suspected murderer that i was going back to an office empty of humanity we were done it made sense we couldnt carry on after this i knew i couldnt take those suspicious looks they would give me my last pay packet and some sort of a payoff then i could move on good night and god bless that was two years ago the dirty suspicious looks never entirely disappeared but those uncomfortable situations became less common every once in a while id go into one of the local pubs and find some semi familiar face glowering at me over a pint and one night two men attacked me and my then boyfriend as we left to go home what did you do theyd asked pressing me against the wall how did you do it theyd picked the wrong people to beat up i handle myself adequately and paul was in training to be a cage fighter but we were relatively gentle with them because i understood their confusion understood their need for an answer where there was none some people would come up to me in a crowded street and tell me they forgave me or that they didnt believe id done anything but ive felt like a curious creature ever since like the last dodo on the island of mauritius even i wonder sometimes did i do something we all hate our coworkers somedays right did i do some magic hoodoo voodoo in my dreams which wiped them all out as you probably know insurance international stayed open and if you know that then you know i stayed working there a minor celebrity thanks to the anythinggoes inclusivity of modern media but fame wasnt really wasnt for me so i went home to the company that might seem strange in fact i know from the article the ghoul returns that some people found it so but where was i to go instead of sacking me the firm said they were intending to keep the branch open but how can it stay open i asked no ones left not even the cleaners i cant be in here on my own i looked around the cavernous office space taking in the man opposite jay jones slouching across a small leather sofa in a tengrand suit we need to rebuild the brand even if we were closing youre the only one with the vaguest idea how things worked around here wed still need you you can help us get things in order so perversely i got a promotion that day along with a massive stress related payout for my silence and the promise not to sue them later i think that might be part of the reason people still give me those looks now as though i somehow engineered the mass suicide of all my colleagues for a mortgage free life and an extra thirty grand a year even my new colleagues tend to be a bit cool with me like i have some magic power which could turn them into human lemmings if only i say the forbidden word i seem to attract the wrong type of man these days as well still a bit of a muscle mary magnet but now different types seem to seek me out because of that normal day because they perceive a darkness in me which really isnt there or at least wasnt before my colleagues all did that thing its funny funny strange rather than funny ha ha but things at insurance international did moreorless return to normal petty jealousies and flirtations business politics and manoeuvring complaints about the cost of property in london bacon rolls and greasy tea at my desk as i reviewed my emails ahead of the late shift getting in life carried on for me but no one else life carried on epilogue this morning when i entered the building and sat at my desk i experienced a dark sense of deja vu another ordinary day i found myself thinking a vague sense of panic building there was a guy who looked almost like that darren leonard guy flirting with a pretty blond from hr and the office had the same quiet vibe it had had all those year ago i shook my head then bit my lip remembering that day i keep the memory of that morning in a thick wooden box marked dont open but i cant help it some days sometimes the lid is open before i even realise that day smells of hospitals and sounds like police sirens today sounds like dread and silence and i dont like it i might tell jay my now boss i need a sick day so i rise and lean against my desk gripping it as though im the hulk preparing to launch it across the room then gaze around for him im on the seventh floor these days management which happened in part to get me away from the workspace downstairs although it didnt make much of a difference the floor is a slightly betterdecorated echo of the room downstairs i havent seen jay all morning so i begin dialling him until i hear his philip glass ringtone in the distance going unanswered as he enters the floor i call to him as he approaches and experience a lurch of fear in my stomach as i become aware he is flanked by a crowd and ordering more to join them as he moves forwards now now now he says as people mutely join him on an upward march but not to me i move and follow anyway creeping along the edges of the gathering crowd hey i ask barry from comms dreading the answer what are we all doing he stops for a moment and pushes a drunk stubby finger onto my lips to silence me but barry we need im muffled by the finger again his pupils are almost nonexistent but he mumbles something which sounds like its time to go is this place cursed i follow the crowd into the stairwell and find myself caught in a river rolling uphill and out onto a roof which youd expect to be kept locked these days to find my colleagues lined up like twenty rows of chess pieces just waiting for what the signal to jump shit i know how this goes ive been here before on that other normal day i cant take this again i think watching jay take his position at the front ready to plunge jay i say to him as i weave through the crowd of people why are you doing this he speaks but his voice sounds far away drugged its its time to go i look back at the mass of people apparently awaiting a sign or an order then i recall the looks i got from the locals last time around after this new travesty takes place god ill be like ceausescu found hanging from a lamppost so i decide this time i act i look into jay jones blank eyes then run as hard and fast as i can past him taking a long jump into nothing stomach in my mouth as i hurtle through the air the phrase apres moi le deluge bubbling into my mind as i go thanks thanks for taking the time to read my story and i hope youll forgive the odd typo or grammatical error that slips through feel free to tell me about any you find via edgarmillion as much as i try to proofread everything i know i miss errors here and there and ill remove them if you tell me if you follow me
